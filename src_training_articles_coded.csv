3,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,27/9/2015,499 words,BY JABER MOHAMED,SNP CHIEF STURGEON BACKTRACKS ON HER VOW TO GIVE A HOME TO SYRIAN REFUGEES,Tabloid,"NICOLA Sturgeon was accused of backtracking last night after it was revealed she had no plans' to let Syrian refugees live in her home despite promising to do so during a television interview. The Scottish First Minister made national headlines after she claimed she would be absolutely happy' to open her home to people fleeing war and violence in the Middle East. But as the first of the 20,000 Syrian refugees due to come to Britain by 2020 arrived on Tuesday, Ms Sturgeon said she would not be offering them the chance to stay at her home. Her spokesman said: She said she would be willing to do it if that's what it took, but she did not say that there were any plans for that to happen. So if you're phoning to find out if there's an update, then there is no update.' Asked in an interview on Sky News on September 6 if she would house Syrian refugees in her own home, Ms Sturgeon replied: Yes, I would. And I've actually been overwhelmed myself over the past few days with messages from people across Scotland saying that they personally would be happy to give a home temporarily - or for a longer period of time - to somebody fleeing Syria.' She added: So, yes, I would absolutely be happy to do that as part of a bigger, wider, more organised approach.' Ms Sturgeon currently lives at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, but also shares a £228,000 Glasgow home with her husband. Thousands of people have offered to house refugees in their homes in recent weeks, among them Live Aid founder Bob Geldof, politician Yvette Cooper and actress Emma Thompson. Last week the Government said that refugees coming to the UK from Syria would not in fact be housed in spare rooms as it is a short-term solution to a long-term problem'. Almost 600 landlords came forward to offer their properties to Syrian refugees as part of a campaign by the charity Citizens UK. Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: This just demonstrates the dangers of politicians making glib promises to get favourable headlines, when they have no intention of delivering. First Nicola said she'd welcome a refugee family to her home, obviously for political gain. Now she is quite clearly back-tracking. It is very insincere indeed, but this is what we've come to expect from the SNP. The public now see they're a party that will say anything for a headline, then when it doesn't suit them, they do the complete opposite.' A spokesman for Ms Sturgeon later added: The First Minister has already made clear that she would be willing to take in refugees, if necessary, like the many thousands of Scots who have already pledged their support. This remains the position.' Ministers have not provided details of the exact number of refugees who landed in the UK, but the first wave is understood to be fewer than 100. The Syrians, who have left their war-torn country and are now staying in camps in neighbouring countries, will receive housing, access to medical care and education, and permission to work. © Mail On Sunday",1

55,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,19/6/2016,380 words,BY SIMON WALTERS,VOTE REMAIN STORMS TO SHOCK 3-POINT LEAD IN LAST-MINUTE SURGE,Tabloid,"THE Remain camp has surged into a three-point lead in the EU referendum campaign in the aftermath of the death of Jo Cox. A Mail on Sunday poll by Survation shows David Cameron s Remain campaign on 45 per cent support, with Boris Johnson s Leave on 42. It reflects a dramatic six-point turnaround since a similar Survation poll on Thursday, hours before the Labour MP was killed. The new telephone poll was conducted on Friday and Saturday as the nation mourned Mrs Cox. In addition to her prominent campaign for Syrian refugees, Mrs Cox was a leading Remain supporter. The six-point switch confirms claims by some commentators that voters could take a more risk-averse approach to leaving the EU so soon after Mrs Cox s shocking death. Survation s Thursday poll showed Leave on 45 and Remain on 42, the exact reverse of today s figures. The number of undecided - 13 per cent - has stayed the same. If undecided voters are excluded, the poll produces a 52-48 per cent majority in favour of staying in the EU. And the gap could get bigger: 46 per cent say Remain are likely to benefit from any additional late surge, with 33 per cent forecasting a late swing to Leave. A win for Remain is forecast by 40 per cent, with 26 per cent predicting victory for Leave. Mr Cameron tops the table for best campaign with 17 per cent, ahead of Boris Johnson on 15, Nigel Farage ten, Michael Gove nine and George Osborne two. However, voters disapproved of Mr Farage s controversial Breaking Point migrant queue poster - 43 per cent said it was inflammatory while 28 per cent said it was fair. Nearly a third (31 per cent) said Mr Cameron s Remain side had conducted the most responsible campaign, with 27 per cent favouring Leave, while an overwhelming seven out of ten said MPs must tone down their verbal attacks on each other. Britain s top pollster, Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, said: After a week in which many polls suggested Leave had leapt into the lead, today s poll will come as a relief to the Remain camp. Mr Cameron will hope the tide has begun to turn. However, he added that it was far from clear if the turnaround was the result of criticism of the Leave campaign following Mrs Cox s death. l Survation interviewed 1,001 adults by telephone on Friday and Saturday.",0

Two men, including a father of four, were trampled to death as passengers stampeded to get off an overcrowded boat landing in Lesbos at dawn. Their arrival came shortly after an agreement meaning migrants illegally reaching the Greek isles should be sent back to Turkey. Many admitted being aware of the new deal but were prepared to risk entering Europe. The mayor of Lesbos, Spiros Galinos, said he was not warned over the policy change, telling the Mail: I have been suggesting this for a long time, but they suddenly announced without telling us. We had no chance to get anything ready. Today the numbers arriving have been about the same so it has not had an immediate impact. Only time will tell if this changes. I can currently take 7,000 migrants, but with EU help I could take 20,000.' He insisted British holidaymakers should not be put off visiting the island. Greece's migrant spokesman Giorgos Kyritsis admitted: A plan like this cannot be put in place in only 24 hours.' Shortly before Saturday's midnight deal deadline passed, two girls aged one and two were found drowned off the island of Ro during an attempted crossing to Greece from Turkey. Among the Lesbos arrivals were Syrian student Hussein Ali Muhammad, who said: I hope to cross these borders. I don't want money, I just want to complete my studies.' Under the agreement all illegal migrants and refugees crossing to Greece from Turkey after yesterday should be deported once they are registered and their asylum claims processed. In return, the EU will take thousands of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey, rewarding it with more cash, early visa-free travel and progress in its EU membership negotiations. Greek officials yesterday scrambled to evacuate migrants currently in island camps to those on the mainland. Terrified children were thrown to the floor when more than 1,000 migrants in Lesbos boarded a ship for Kavala in Northern Greece. Turkey is thought to have demanded that all existing migrants held on the island before Saturday's deadline were moved so they were not returned with new arrivals. At least 144,000 people have arrived in Greece so far in 2016 according to UN refugee agency data. More than half landed on Lesbos and some 1,150 people a day continued to arrive in Greece from Turkey this month. ÷Kosovan premier Isa Mustafa yesterday confirmed that his brother Ragip had sought asylum in Germany's southwestern Rheinland-Pfalz state for medical reasons. © Daily Mail",1
72,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,5/2/2016,491 words,BY DANIEL MARTIN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT,PM HAILS £7BN AID BOOST FOR SYRIA… £1.2BN OF IT FROM UK,Tabloid,"DAVID Cameron last night hailed a £7billion boost to tackle the Syrian crisis - amid warnings that tens of thousands more refugees are heading to Turkey. International leaders pledged the huge sum - apparently the largest ever pledged in one day for a humanitarian crisis - during a meeting in London. The Prime Minister said the aid, including an extra £1.2billion from Britain by 2020, would save lives and give hope'. Britain's pledge compares with an extra £1.8billion from Germany by 2018 but is much more than the £700million put forward by France and £600million from the United States. The European Union has pledged £2.3billion. Australia, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Austria, Switzerland, Estonia, Denmark and Finland also committed funds. It came as the Turkish prime minister said an estimated 70,000 Syrians fleeing bombing were moving towards his country. Ahmet Davutoglu blamed Russian raids for making the crisis worse by bolstering the murderous regime of President Assad and cutting off a crucial aid corridor. Last night, Russia accused Turkey of actively preparing to invade Syria. Mr Cameron said rich nations had now promised £4.1billion to be spent this year, and a further £3.4billion by 2020. Britain has more than doubled its funding to £2.3billion over the next four years. Countries neighbouring Syria have also agreed to educate refugee children to ensure there is no lost generation', he added. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon declared: Never has the international community raised so much money on a single day for a single crisis.' Downing Street said much of the money will be spent on building schools and creating jobs to make it more attractive for refugees fleeing Syria to stay in the region rather than attempting to reach Europe. Mr Cameron said that the conference had sent out a clear message to the people of Syria and the region. We will stand with you and we will support you for as long as it takes to secure peace in Syria, to restore stability to the region and to give Syrian refugees a chance to go back and rebuild their homes and their country,' he said. He urged Russia to use its influence with the Syrian regime to bring an end to violence against civilians and help foster a ceasefire. The Prime Minister said one million children currently not in school would be given access to education by the end of the next school year. He said: This is not just morally right. It is vital for long-term stability. We cannot have a generation of refugees left out of school, unable to get work, vulnerable to extremism and radicalisation.' Countries in the region have agreed to open up their economies to create new jobs and the move will be backed by £27billion of loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. As a result there will be over one million new jobs in the region for refugees and residents alike,' Mr Cameron said. © Daily Mail",1

THEN CLADDING SPREAD BLAZE,Tabloid,"FIREFIGHTERS thought they had extinguished the Grenfell Tower blaze and were packing up to leave when it suddenly flared up, it was revealed last night. They were astonished to spot flames shooting up the side of the building, adding weight to the theory that flammable cladding caused the disaster. Crews responded quickly to the fire in a fridge in Flat 16, and within minutes were telling residents it was out, BBC Panorama reported. But soon after, the 24-storey block was consumed in the inferno that killed an estimated 79 people. The revelation comes amid growing anger at the handling of the crisis, with claims some survivors are being ignored' and others rehoused far from London. Some 250 investigators led by a murder detective is probing those responsible for the inferno, with prosecutors advising on possible manslaughter charges. Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy pledged to ensure those responsible are brought to justice'. He said yesterday: On Saturday, I went to the top floor. I have seen some terrible things [in my service]. But I don't think anything prepared me for what I was going to see in there.' The police chief would not say if there will be raids to preserve evidence after MP David Lammy called for searches of offices and homes of the contractors involved in fitting flammable cladding on the tower. But he said the investigation will be far-reaching', including how the building was maintained, fire safety measures and an £8.6million refurbishment. The Mail found builders saved just £6,250 by fitting cladding with a plastic core that spreads fire. Last night Mrs May led a crisis meeting of the Grenfell Tower Taskforce. She said she would urgently look into reports that survivors had been poorly treated, with some given as little as £20 to live on. Survivor Christabel Castro, 26, who has been put in a local hotel, said some neighbours still had nowhere to stay including an older lady who lives on her own'. At least ten families have been placed 30 miles away in Ascot, Berkshire, and have to return by taxi to get donations. It was claimed some residents have been rehoused as far away as Birmingham, Manchester and Preston, which is 220 miles from London - but No 10 yesterday said these reports were false'. Families also complained donations have not been distributed to those in need. Yesterday it was reported up to 42 victims were found in just one room, although this could not be verified. However it emerged a missing family of five, thought to be Syrian refugees, has been found safe. It also emerged a nine-year-old boy, Amiel Miller, saved his entire family on the 17th floor after waking up and telling his parents: Mum, I think there's a fire.' London Fire Commissioner Dany Cotton yesterday said the controversial advice to stay put' during a fire will be kept for other blocks. She said this fire was unusual and that more injuries' would result in other fires in high-rise buildings if the advice was ignored. Meanwhile Downing Street pledged any illegal immigrants who had been in Grenfell Tower will not be deported if they come forward for help. The Lord Chief Justice is expected to appoint a judge to oversee the independent inquiry into the tragedy this week. © Daily Mail",0

128,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,14/12/2015,1507 words,NA,DOES THIS WOMAN HOLD THE SCRET TO LIFELONG HAPPINESS?,Tabloid,"SHE SAYS IT STARTS SIMPLY MAKING YOUR BED EACH MORNING BY JAN MOIR Ask yourself this question: Are you happy? Really happy? Four years ago, Serena Kennedy, from Cheam, Surrey, was not an entirely happy woman. Neither was her friend Beverly Worsley, who was trying to regain her emotional equilibrium after suffering depression. Meanwhile, accountant Genny Jones, from Kent, was newly divorced, flat broke and living with her two teenage sons. Life seemed bleak for each of these women then they read a book that was to change their lives for ever. The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin chronicles the American author's merciless, year-long endeavour to cast off the shackles of gloom and become a better and happier person. By applying the strictures of scientific thought, economics and positive psychology to her life, Rubin banished despondency and surged onto the sunlit uplands of a more joyful existence. The former lawyer, who is married with two young daughters, became a better wife, mother, person, friend and all-round human being. She learned to sing in the morning, nourish her spirituality and was candid enough to admit money can buy happiness if you spend it wisely. If you were to boil her philosophy down to the basics, achieving lasting Gretchen happiness would come to this: stop eating sugar, tidy your cutlery drawer, cherish novelty, meet deadlines and seize the moment. Above all, her mantra is that outer order leads to inner calm. And she exhorts her readers to begin each day with one simple act: make your bed. The Happiness Project became an international bestseller, staying at the top of the book charts for two years. It sold millions of copies in more than 30 languages, and readers went on to set up their own happiness groups. Serena Kennedy, 50, a HR manager, and Beverly Worsley, 55, a charity fundraiser, are two of these readers. They set up their Happiness Group in Esher, Surrey, in 2011. Their group is thriving. They also deliver lunch and learn' sessions on happiness into the business world. The word happy can have weird connotations. People can be resistant as they initially think it's a religious thing, but it is a force for good,' says Beverly. Loftier minds might argue that making the pursuit of happiness the centre of your life is selfish and self-indulgent. But Gretchen argues that happy people are more productive, interested in others, involved in the problems of the world, altruistic and healthier. One of the best ways to be happy is to make other people happy, and one of the best ways of making other people happy is to be happy yourself,' she says. None of this is self-indulgent or trivial. Trying to be happy is a worthy pursuit.' In Gravesend, Kent, Genny Jones, 53, launched her own Happiness Group, which meets in a local coffee shop. Inspired by Gretchen's doctrine that fun is energising, Genny even auditioned for the TV show Britain's Got Talent. Calling herself the Confident Queen and singing in a pair of wellies, she may not have made it through to the next round, but Simon Cowell did say every town in Britain needs a Genny'. More importantly, Genny was enjoying herself, rather than sitting at home feeling miserable. Gretchen changed my life,' she says. Clearly, Gretchen Rubin is on to something with her self-help books, except she doesn't call them self-help books; she likes to call them books that are self-helping, which is apparently a big difference. Maybe so, but it is undeniable that the person they are helping most is 49-year-old Gretchen, who lives in a three-storey New York apartment with her handsome, rich husband, who happens to be a private equities trader with a hedge fund firm. A lot of women might say that would be enough to make me happy, right there. However, on top of this, Gretchen's books have made her wealthy on her own merits, she has appeared on the Oprah show and this year had tea with the Dalai Lama (He looked just like a waxwork of himself'). Critics might also say the lucrative happiness racket means trading on the unhappiness of others. And that in this world of pain and problems, terminal illness and luckless Syrian refugees, to focus on nagging less and hugging more, on making one of Gretchen's resolutions lists or striving to keep a contented heart is opportunistic, even facetious. Look, I am writing a book, people can buy it or not if they want,' says Gretchen. My approach is to write from my own experience. I am not a scientist, I am not a sociologist, I am who I am and I respond to my own problems and the problems of readers who email me. Syrian refugees do not email me and I would never think to speak to that experience. However, it is not selfish to want to be happier.' We meet in a coffee shop near Gretchen's home in Manhattan's Upper East Side. She arrives in her second best' dog-walking shoes and a purple tweed pea jacket. She is friendly, as slender as a stick of celery and her russet hair and pale complexion are testament to her Scottish/Swedish antecedents. She drinks black coffee and talks fluently at breakneck speed. Her response to one simple question did the idea for the book just come to you? elicited a monster 600-word response, a flavour of which follows: It was arduous . . . the intellectual process increasingly convinced me . . . an experience . . . resonate . . . idea and expectation. It almost melted my brain. So many false starts. Understanding. Weirder. Deeper. I can't really remember.' What she really meant was: No. Applying the ferocious levels of discipline one would expect from a woman who once made and kept 92 New Year's resolutions, Gretchen still avoids sugar and has not eaten carbohydrates for three years. Not a single one? Nope.' Wow. I lost 10lb in a flash and I am much less hungry because I used to have a lot of trouble with hunger, and it is really inconvenient to be hungry. Now I don't have to worry any more about things such as portion control.' She has an electric seven-egg boiler and every morning hard boils eggs to last her family the day. Her two children, she says, do eat sugar and carbs. Sort of. There is the danger of the backlash if something is forbidden. Then they want it more. We don't have spaghetti for dinner, we don't have bagels at the weekend but they have toast for breakfast, they have desserts and eat candy on Halloween.' All this might make Gretchen sound like a funless, egg-munching monster, but her saving grace is that she and her books are funny and self-deprecating. I crave applause! I will do whatever I can to excel! I always did my homework and I want everyone to love me,' she says. Even a self-help book hater like me can see the practical wisdom in much of what she advocates. For example, I often don't reply to emails because I feel I don't have time to answer them properly. I'll do it later, I say then never do. Now I apply a Gretchen stricture don't let the good be the enemy of the perfect and accept that a short note is better than none at all. Sometimes you need someone to point out the obstacles on your yellow brick road to inner contentment right Gretchen? Right, Jan.' I am with her on the therapeutic and practical benefits of clearing out your wardrobe as well as your psyche. A calm and tidy home is a happy home and to this end, Gretchen subdivides household clutter into crutch clutter (things you wear, but know you shouldn't), buyer's remorse clutter (hanging onto bad purchases because you can't admit you made a mistake), aspirational clutter (high heels you can't walk in), freebie clutter and nostalgic clutter. Since The Happiness Project she's written two more books, Happier At Home and Better Than Before, out in paperback this week (Two Roads, £8.99), in which she tackles the patterns of behaviour that shape us. Her first step to understanding different motivations and weaknesses is to divide the populace into the Four Fateful Tendencies, which describe how we respond to the expectation of others. The categories are: Upholders (who meet other people's expectations and their own); Obligers (meet other people's expectations, but resist their own); Rebels (they resist other people's and their own expectations); and Questioners (who resist other people's expectations, but meet their own). Understanding why you behave in such a way makes it easier to change habit strategy. I am an Obliger, while Gretchen is a goody-two shoes Upholder. What is persuasive about Gretchen is her belief that people don't need to be changed, they just need to be made aware of what is in their power to change. And who doesn't want answers to life's big questions? Of course, those whose lives are close to crisis don't have time for all this stuff and Gretchen agrees that her devotees tend to be the comfortable middle classes but don't they deserve to be happy, too? I hate the notion happiness is superficial or that happy people are stupid and people who are discerning and deep must somehow be unhappy. I say, if you don't want to be happy, OK, fine. Knock yourself out. The rest of us are trying our best.' © Daily Mail",0
143,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,8/10/2014,788 words,BY LARISA BROWN DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT,WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIGHT TO THE DEATH IN LAST STAND OF KOBANI,Tabloid,"CHILDREN armed with AK-47s fought to the death to defend Kobani yesterday after air strikes failed to stop their Islamic State enemies. They had ignored orders to flee from Kurdish officials who warned they could no longer protect them. Using tanks and advanced weaponry, the jihadis easily outgunned the garrison of the Syrian border town. Their relentless advance starkly illustrates the limitations of air strikes. Six US-led bombing raids had appeared to slow the IS assault on Kobani, destroying four armoured vehicles and damaging a tank. Kurdish forces scored similar successes in the south and east of Kobani. Yet government officials later said the town, which has been besieged for three weeks, was about to fall. The announcement came as photos emerged of families - including women and children - joining in the fight against IS. A boy of barely ten was pictured carrying an AK-47. Another picture showed a gun-toting teenage girl wearing a hoodie, jeans and ballet pumps. The photographs were posted on Twitter yesterday with the comment: Kurdish family vs Isis terrorists in Kobani. Kurds in Kobani need help!' Artillery shells continued to thump into densely packed neighbourhoods yesterday. Thousands of militants have advanced into the south-west of Kobani and are engaged in desperate street-fighting. Mahmoud, 50, said he had seen IS fighters in the streets: I don't know where they were all coming from, but once they were killed, more IS would come.' A veteran Kurdish leader, Omar Sheikhmous, said civilians were being advised to flee to Turkey - out of the reach of IS. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Syrian refugees in Gaziantep, a town near the border: The problem of IS cannot be solved via air bombardment. Kobani is about to fall.' Fourteen Turkish tanks were lined up just 200 yards across the border from Kobani. Turkey, a member of Nato, has done little despite pledging to stop Kobani from falling to IS. One Twitter user wrote: So our Nato ally is standing close by, watch(ing) kids and grannies fight IS?' Syrian Kurds have said that not only are the Turks not helping, they are actually hindering the defence of Kobani by preventing Kurdish militiamen in Turkey from crossing the border. The Turkish government is said to fear encouraging the Kurdish separatist movement inside its own borders. Syrian Kurds have exploited the state of civil war in their country to carve out a self-governing region on their side of the border. Kurdish officials issued a fresh plea for international intervention, saying: We are calling out to all international powers, forces from Kurdistan and Kurdish public that IS thugs must be stopped and thousands of civilians must be saved from massacre.' If they do take the town, IS - also known as Isis - will control an unbroken 125-mile stretch of frontier between Turkey and Syria. More than 400 people have been killed in the Kobani region since the fighting began, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Two black IS flags were seen flying on Kobani's eastern fringe on Monday, hours before militants punctured the Kurdish front lines and advanced into the town itself. David Cameron faced fresh pressure to extend the RAF's air campaign against IS into Syria, while Kurdish officials and analysts said the extremists would only be defeated by ground troops. Charlie Cooper, a spokesman at the Quilliam Foundation, a British counter-extremism think-tank, told the Mail: Air strikes won't really work because IS are continually changing tactics. What they do now is they run and shelter when they hear the planes coming, and while it may slow them down, it does not kill them.' In Iraq, US forces have begun attacking IS forces with helicopter gunships, which are supposed to be limited to protecting the American embassy in Baghdad. Low-flying Apache helicopters, which can be mounted with machine guns, rather than bombs, are said to be the closest thing to ground troops without putting boots on the ground. *** ÷POLICE failed to stop a schoolgirl feared to be travelling to Syria despite being told that she had run away with her passport. Three hours after Samya Dirie's parents alerted officers on September 24, she got on a flight from Heathrow to Turkey with another girl. The girls are believed to have met online and arranged to travel to Syria, apparently to join Islamic State militants. Samya, 17, from Stockwell, South London, was a dedicated student, her family said yesterday. She has not contacted her parents, but has told a cousin she is far away' and fears what the police will do if she returns. Her father Abidirashiid Dirie issued an emotional plea, saying: You haven't committed any crime. Come back safely.'   © Daily Mail",0
160,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,14/9/2016,931 words,BY PRITI PATEL,TOO MUCH OF YOUR MONEY IS SIMPLY STOLEN OR SQUANDERED,Tabloid,"THE aid budget isn't my money, or the Government's money. It's taxpayers' money - your money. We politicians have a duty to spend it well, in ways that not only help the world's poorest, but also help us here at home. When people see aid being used properly, they support it. The British people are incredibly generous - just look at our response to Comic Relief or the support that has been given to the Disasters Emergency Committee over the years. The people of Britain have helped to halve global deaths from malaria in just 15 years - saving 6 million lives. And I've seen for myself the incredible impact of the UK's support for Syrian refugees and the fight against Ebola. And at its best, the global aid system does fantastic, life-saving work - for example through the global funds that deliver vaccines for children and that fight deadly diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis. These are successes, of which we can all be proud. And these achievements also make us safer. Disasters, conflicts and diseases don't pay attention to national borders. We need to act before problems grow and threaten the UK. But we need to face facts. Too much aid doesn't find its way through to those who really need it. And too often, money is spent without a proper focus on results and outcomes that allow the poorest to stand on their own two feet. Some participants in the aid debate are resistant to criticism and sometimes unwilling to understand or even acknowledge genuine concerns. It rightly infuriates taxpayers when money that is intended for the world's poorest people is stolen or wasted on inappropriate projects. I am infuriated. My predecessors worked hard to make sure that British aid ends up where it should. But we can improve. And Britain - with its strong reputation on aid around the world - is in a unique position to ensure that across the globe, aid is being used effectively, in a way that delivers for our national interests. The system needs reform - and Britain can lead the way in delivering it. I believe passionately in the mission of the department that I now run: to end extreme poverty forever, to spread prosperity, and, as a result, to build a safer world for us here in the UK. That is a long-term goal that Britain and its expertise can work towards and one that we can be proud of. My parents came to this country as refugees from sub-Saharan Africa. I have had the privilege of working in business across Africa and Asia. And I have seen with my own eyes the burning injustice and tragic waste of human potential that poverty, disease and war bring. Let us be clear: if we allow extreme poverty, instability and humanitarian crises to go unchecked, the consequences will eventually be felt just as deeply back in Britain as they are abroad. Britain has a proud record as a global leader and, following the referendum result, we have an opportunity to further build on our place in the world. As Secretary of State for International Development, my objective will be to challenge and change the global aid system so that it properly serves the poorest people in the world and the taxpayers who foot the bill. I will ask the tough questions and provide a fresh pair of eyes. My approach will be built on some core Conservative principles: that the way to end poverty is wealth creation, not aid dependency; that wealth is ultimately created by people, not by the state; that poor countries need more investment and trade, not less; and that we need to empower the poorest to work and trade their way out of poverty, not treat them as passive recipients of our support. My predecessors in government have made huge progress in improving British aid - creating an independent aid watchdog to scrutinise spending, introducing much tougher value for money controls, and making DfID's spending far more open and transparent. Now I want to build on their achievements and go even further, for example by insisting on much greater transparency from those who receive UK aid, so that we can all see whether money is actually making it through to those who need it. I want to continue the leadership that has been shown on tackling the scourge of corruption, which keeps people poor. I want to build on the great work that has been done on things like immunisation, tackling killer diseases, and ending the scandal of human trafficking and modern slavery. And I want to use our aid budget to directly address the great global challenges that affect the UK - like creating jobs in poorer countries so as to reduce the pressure for mass migration to Europe. But I don't see my new job as just about aid. I want to help build the UK's trading partners of tomorrow. We must seize the opportunity of leaving the EU to expand free trade with those who need it most, to boost investment in the poorest countries, and to forge new alliances with the world's emerging economies. And of course, I want to use our greater freedom from leaving the EU to deliver better value for UK taxpayers. We will honour the commitments that we have made on development in our manifesto. But let me be clear. A well-financed aid budget is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Its purpose is not to make us feel good about ourselves. It is there to deliver tangible results for the world's poorest people, helping them stand on their own two feet so they don't need aid in the future - and in so doing, build a safer, more prosperous world for the UK. The purpose of everyone working in the aid business should be to do themselves out of a job - by building a world free from extreme poverty. © Daily Mail",1
177,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,8/10/2015,1154 words,BY SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE,BENAUD'S EX GOES INTO BAT TO FIGHT FOR FORTUNE,Tabloid,"AS The Voice of Cricket', Richie Benaud was so polite that he is said to have let slip only one profanity in more than 40 years commentating on the game an exclamation of Jesus!' when he saw someone picking the seam of the ball. His devoted English widow, Daphne, could however be forgiven for allowing herself some choice language as she is being sued by his first wife, Marcia Lavender, over the former Australia captain's will. Marcia, 85 who split up with Benaud in 1965 after a 12-year marriage and the elder of their two sons, Gregory, 61, dispute Daphne's claims about how much Benaud's multi-million-pound estate is worth. Benaud's wealth was held in complex property trusts, Australia's Supreme Court was told yesterday. The value of the estate does not accord in any way to the value my client was told when the deceased was alive,' Gregory's lawyer, Raoul Wilson, told the court in Sydney. Daphne, 78, who met Benaud while working as a secretary to the celebrated cricket writer E.W. Swanton, was ordered to hand over all the details of his estate, providing a full list of assets, income and liabilities. Marcia and Gregory want provision [to] be made for [their] maintenance and advancement' out of the estate of Benaud, who died of skin cancer in April aged 84. It is understood that Daphne, who married Benaud in 1967, has made a settlement offer to the pair, which has been rejected as they ascertain the true value of the estate. The Benauds had a property in Sydney as well as a home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer in the South of France, where they spent six months a year during the English cricket season. His estate includes pension funds in Australia as well as property trusts and managed investment funds. The case will return to court in December and both sides will take part in compulsory mediation.   *** AFter much prevarication, the self-important Robert Peston has finally confirmed that he is leaving his role as the BBC's economics editor to join ITV as their political editor. And it seems his colleagues are glad to see the back of him, judging by this notice which went up yesterday at a BBC press area at the Tory conference. Stephen Walker, the BBC Northern Ireland political correspondent, shared a photo of the BBC only' sign that has been appended with a hand-written note to ban the floppy-haired Peston from entering. Last week, Peston (above) was openly mocked by senior BBC broadcasters including Jonathan Dimbleby and Huw Edwards, who begged him to stay on at the Beeb in an on-air Radio 4 appeal. ***   FOLLOWING his acrimonious divorce from banking heiress Kate Rothschild, who left him for rapper Jay Electronica, financier Ben Goldsmith might be advised to keep a closer eye on his second marriage. For his wife-of-ten-months Jemima Jones, 28 (inset, with Ben), a former lingerie model turned caterer, has been sunning herself in Ibiza with her Oxford Brookes University contemporary, investment banker Matt Cochand (above right). Jokily sporting a woman's bikini top, which is being caressed by Jemima, Matt attempts to explain the bizarre image with the caption: Me being me' to which Jemima responds in jest, Sexy beast'. At least Ben, 34, whose brother Zac is the newly selected Conservative London mayoral candidate, can take some comfort in the fact that Matt's apparent penchant for cross-dressing is a quality seldom sought after by women. ***   Reports that devil-may-care Boris Johnson hasn't even bothered to round up the support of Tory MPs for his putative leadership campaign may be wide of the mark. For I hear the London Mayor has been hosting a series of intimate curry parties' at home in Islington with his half-Indian wife Marina. MPs are invited along for a chat and Boris is very much on friendly terms rather than being their superior,' says my man with the papadums. ***   BILLIE Piper recently revealed she has a girl crush' on Harry Potter star Emma Watson. Now it appears her husband Laurence Fox is responding in kind'. The Lewis star, 37, tweeted this picture (right) of himself embracing his co-star Kevin Whately on Tuesday night, when the ninth series of the detective drama returned to ITV. Lewis is for LOVERS,' writes Laurence enthusiastically, while wrapping his arms around Whately, who, despite his demonstrable acting skills on the show, fails to muster similar enthusiasm. ***   Sam Mendes says Spectre, the new James Bond film, will not be the longest in the franchise's history. Reports suggested that the latest instalment would surpass the 145-minutes of Daniel Craig's first outing in Casino Royale. At the moment, it's exactly the same length as Skyfall,' says Mendes. Let's hope Craig hasn't been forced to forgo his new signature Dirty Martini to make the cut. ***   Brewing heir Patrick Guinness, 58, father of society model Jasmine Guinness, is selling his 18th-century County Kildare estate, Furness House. He told an RTE radio show this week that the 15-bedroom property might be used to house Syrian refugees. Complimented by the host, Ryan Tubridy, for his generosity, Guinness added jokily: Preferably female, aged between 20 and 30.' Not surprisingly, the state broadcaster removed the comments from the show online, calling them offensive'. ***   Husband No.3 is the splendidly named Ned Rocknroll, nephew of Sir Richard Branson. So it's good to see Kate Winslet living up to her marital name. The Oscar-winning mother-of-three (left) was spotted out in New York this week sporting a particularly racy pair of leather trousers. But is such garb appropriate for her age? Winslet turned 40 on Monday, which she described as really empowering and not in any way daunting'. She clearly feels empowered enough to dress like a woman half her age. ***   The widely held belief that Radio 4's Today programme is required listening for the political class has been punctured by Lynton Crosby, the Australian election strategist whose dark arts' helped David Cameron to victory in May. During the campaign, I never listened to the, er ... is it the Today programme that's on the BBC in the morning?' asked Crosby. Although he is moving to Canada to advise PM Stephen Harper, Crosby clearly retains Cameron's ear. I hate Twitter. It's an angry echo chamber for those involved in politics,' he said words neatly echoed in Dave's conference speech. ***   MOVING to Hollywood has become a rite of passage for many British actors Emily Blunt has even become a fully fledged U.S. citizen but former child star Hayley Mills is shunning Tinseltown for the sake of her health. Fame can have a big impact on your mental health you have to balance it,' the 69-year-old, who starred in The Parent Trap in 1961, tells me. Living in Hollywood is very difficult. That's why I've never lived out there.' She adds: The focus there is all on the film industry. Whereas, here, in England, it's about life and family and friends. Well-known actors can just get on with their lives in a normal way.' © Daily Mail",0
181,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,3/2/2016,1304 words,BY MAX HASTINGS,THIS SHAM DEAL WILL ONLY MAKE VOTERS EVEN MORE CYNICAL,Tabloid,"David Cameron today believes himself on the brink of a triumph. His proposed EU renegotiation needs only endorsement at a summit of the other 27 members. This would be followed by a June referendum, ending with an in' vote that will scupper his foes in Ukip and on the Tory Right. But what if he is wrong? What if yesterday's draft settlement, requiring merely a shifting of deckchairs in Brussels, provokes a seismic shift in the British body politic? Read President of the European Council Donald Tusk's letter, which makes plain how little has changed, for instance on migrants: We need to fully respect the principles of freedom of movement and non-discrimination.' Most of what Cameron claims to have secured will remain vague aspiration, a country mile from implementation. Who else would trumpet the securing of an emergency brake' on migrants' benefits over which he will have little control, or a red card system that requires the support of more than half of our bickering EU neighbours on any given issue? This much is plain: the sham of a renegotiation, the pretence that the Prime Minister meant what he told us for years about his intention to change our terms of membership of the EU, has spawned a cynicism across the land that will not quickly be dispelled. No politician dares to tell voters all the truth about difficult issues, because the message would be so bleak that they could never win an election. But we are entitled to hear more truth more of the time than we get from David Cameron. The consequence of his past evasions and outright deceits is that now when we are asked to endorse his judgment, to accept his assurance that we are better staying in Europe than getting out, it is hard to do so. I wrote here back in 2009 that it was Cameron's misfortune that he would become our national leader at a moment when to be merely an adequate prime minister would not suffice: he needed to show himself a great one. At that time, I was thinking chiefly of our crippling debt problem. As matters have evolved over the intervening seven years, however, other equally grave problems have emerged, headed by the migrant crisis and the struggle with Muslim extremism. In response to the challenges, on the credit side Cameron has supported George Osborne in making a modest start towards curbing the deficit. He handles himself in the Commons and on the world stage with the natural authority of a country squire opening village fetes. By winning last year's general election, he saved Britain from the disaster of Ed Miliband. Yet through it all, Cameron shows no sign of having any higher purpose than that of holding together the Conservative Party, keeping himself in office until he quits to make a fortune and passes the reins to George Osborne. He seems prepared, meanwhile, to tell the British people whatever might shut us up until next week. Ghastly He promised his 2014 party conference that a future Tory government would cut immigration, repeal the Human Rights Act and repatriate powers from Brussels, when he had not the smallest intention of doing anything significant to advance those objectives. He told the Commons last November that 70,000 Syrian moderates' were waiting to join with the Kurds to fight Islamic State, if we would do our bit by sending four RAF Tornados to provide air support. This seemed tosh then, and is tosh now, on a subject rightfully too serious for spin-doctoring. He delivers ringing denunciations of what he describes as great evils of our time, most recently social inequality and alleged racism at Oxbridge and in the police and Armed Forces, while saying pitifully little about the matters that passionately concern most British people: mass migration, the failure of the state education system, the need to prevent the NHS from bankrupting our children and the manifold failures of the EU. The best defence that can be made of Cameron is that he is no more guilty than his fellow European leaders in refusing to face harsh realities. Almost all of them have abrogated responsibility for credible security policies, at a time when Russia looks more menacing than for three decades. They are in denial about the enormity of the migration threat. We are not talking here about a few hundred thousand Syrian refugees, but tens of millions of economic migrants striving to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Absolutely nothing in the Cameron renegotiation' with Brussels will prevent these people from coming here once they secure some sort of EU documentation, as most assuredly will. My old friend Mervyn King, former Governor of the Bank of England, has always argued that history will judge Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, much more harshly than do her contemporaries. Even before Merkel's ghastly blunder in publicly opening Germany's doors to millions of migrants, she has maintained a posture of stubborn denial about the precariousness of the eurozone and the irrecoverable debts still burdening banks and whole nations. She will not tell the German people what every numerate person knows, that Greece's vast sovereign debt will sooner or later have to be written off. Meanwhile, France has fundamental social and economic problems that no Paris government seems capable of persuading its electorate to face. Exasperated Every day, the supposedly intelligent political leaders of Europe tell their peoples falsehoods that would make Pinocchio's nose fall off. One of the most powerful arguments for leaving the EU is that its dominant members refuse to admit its bureaucratic stagnation and absence of accountability. It is plain they will not do so unless or until economic disaster brings their temple down about their ears: Europe is incapable of self-reform. David Cameron wishes us to swallow the nonsense of his renegotiation', when, in truth, he has simply reached a personal decision to forget his Eurosceptic past, shrug his shoulders and stick with the tottering European club, in sickness or in health. Last month, I asked a group of clever thirtysomethings what they thought about the EU. They said they wanted to be convinced that we should stay in, but nobody had yet offered credible arguments for doing so. A retired captain of industry a Tory and lifelong European told me recently that he has become so exasperated by Cameron's condescension in assuring us that the moon is made of green cheese, figuratively speaking, that he is now minded to vote out'. So am I. The arguments do not all run one way, and we should disbelieve those who claim they do. We all favour a free trade area, a genuine common market. Leaving Europe will not solve some of our grave national problems, starting with the failure of the education system, poor productivity and a chronic balance of trade deficit. But the Prime Minister and his henchmen seem to want Britain to stay in this creaking union merely because they are too slothful to contemplate the alternative. Our squire wants no unpleasantness at the harvest supper. Yet a leader of more courage and imagination would at least consider the logic of addressing the EU's perhaps irredeemable predicament by leaving it. David Cameron is not a bad prime minister Gordon Brown and Tony Blair did far more harm. But he has utterly failed thus far to rise to the greatness of the challenges he and this country face. The times require a visionary leader of the stamp of Margaret Thatcher or Clement Attlee. Instead, we have a man resembling that oh-so-soothing 1930s appeaser, Stanley Baldwin. Cameron could yet win his summer referendum on Europe, for the usual reasons such things happen: on the day, voters prove too scared to risk the unknowns of out'. But on the case the Prime Minister has made thus far, and following the risible draft deal he has struck with Donald Tusk, he does not deserve to. © Daily Mail",0
196,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,4/9/2015,1254 words,BY EMINE SINMAZ IN TURKEY AND VANESSA ALLEN IN LONDON,THEY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS,Tabloid,"THE heartbreaking images of their bodies symbolise the horror of the refugee crisis. But, for their griefstricken father, the deaths of Aylan and Galip Kurdi are a personal tragedy. Sobbing uncontrollably, Abdullah Kurdi yesterday recalled his terror when a flimsy and overcrowded dinghy capsized and his wife and children vanished beneath the Mediterranean waves. His sons, who were just five and three, slipped from his grasp in pitch-black waters off Bodrum in Turkey. With the night air pierced by the screams of his fellow Syrian refugees he tried in vain to save wife Rehan. I was holding her, but my children slipped through my hands,' he said. We tried to cling to the boat, but it was deflating. It was dark and everyone was screaming. I could not hear the voices of my children and my wife.' Over the following three hellish hours in the water, Mr Kurdi battled for survival, while frantically searching for his sons and his wife, who had also been pulled from his reach. He found one child but it was too late - the boy had drowned. My first son died from the high waves,' he said. I was obliged to leave him to save the other one. I tried to swim to the beach by following the lights. I looked for my wife and child on the beach but couldn't find them. I thought they had got scared and had run away and I went back to Bodrum. When they did not come to our meeting point I went to the hospital and learned the bitter truth.' The barber had paid people smugglers £2,900 over the course of three attempts to reach Greece from a refugee camp in Turkey. But he has told friends he wished he had also drowned to be spared a lifetime of self-recrimination over the family's desperate gamble for a better life. Pictures of Aylan and Galip have been shared by social networkers around the world, prompting calls for politicians to do more for fleeing Syrians. Aid agencies have been inundated with donations and offers of help. They have even taken calls from families offering to take desperate refugees into their homes. Mr Kurdi told the Daily Mail: I wanted a better life for them, that's why I left. I just hope that this photo of my son changes everything. We want the world's attention on us, so that they can prevent the same from happening to others. Let these be the last things that happened to us here, in the country where we took refuge to escape war in our homeland. We want the whole world to see this.' The Kurdi family had hoped to move to Canada but had not made a formal application to emigrate there. Mr Kurdi's sister Tima, who lives in Vancouver, said an application for her other brother Mohammed had failed because he did not have formal refugee status. They didn't deserve to die,' she said of her nephews. They were going for a better life. It shouldn't have happened to them.' Family pictures of the boys on Facebook made an unbearably poignant contrast with the images of their bodies, washed on to the beach at Bodrum. Smiling and laughing, they were hand in hand with their father or cuddled up together with a soft toy. As he prepared to take his family's bodies back to Syria for burial, Mr Kurdi said he could not face trying to build a life in Europe without them. Instead the ethnic Kurd will return to his former home in the border town of Kobane, despite it being under constant threat from Islamic State extremists. All I want is to be with my children - they were the most beautiful children in the world,' he said. Is there anybody in the world for whom their child is not the most precious thing? They woke me every morning to play with me. Now everything is gone.' Mr Kurdi and his wife Rehan, 35, fled Damascus in 2012, first for Aleppo and then Kobane. Three-year-old Aylan had spent his entire life on the move as his family fleed from fighting in their homeland. Friends said they endured shelling in Kobane before leaving last year as IS forces were poised to seize the town. Mr Kurdi said he had worked as an odd-job man and sold the family's belongings in the streets in a bid to fund their dream of a new life in either Canada or Europe. But once in Turkey, the family hit a bureaucratic dead end because they were Kurds. They faced difficulties registering as refugees with the UN and could not gain refugee exit visas to leave Turkey legitimately. In desperation, they turned to the people smugglers. Coastguards intercepted their boat on their first attempt to reach the Greek island of Kos. The second time round the traffickers failed to show up at the rendezvous point. Mr Kurdi said a Turkish smuggler started the third voyage with him and other Syrians with whom he had obtained the boat. They had been at sea for only four minutes when the dinghy began taking on water. The captain saw that the waves were so high and as he tried to steer the boat we were hit immediately,' said Mr Kurdi. He panicked and dived into the sea and fled. I took over and started steering, but the waves were so high that the boat flipped immediately. I took my wife and my kids in my arms. Now all I want is to lie in a grave next to them.' Mr Kurdi broke down after seeing his sons' bodies in the morgue, running from the building and crying out My God, my God'. Three coffins were later loaded into a white ambulance to be flown to Istanbul and to the Syrian border. Funerals are due to be held in Kobane today. Residents in Bodrum said the discovery of bodies on the beach was a grim daily reality. At the city's state hospital, director Orhan Yuce said seven children were drowned on the night Aylan and Galip died. We see this every day. It breaks my heart,' he said. It's got so much worse this year. Hundreds of people. Every day. We have no idea of the real numbers - all we know is those who are washed up on our shores. It's terrible. All these lives must not be forgotten.' Save the Children said the images of Aylan and Galip had made a huge impact on public opinion. This image has put a human face on this tragedy that's been mired in statistics so far,' said Gemma Parkin, a spokesman for the charity. When you think about it in the context of it being your child perhaps, I think that's where the tide of public opinion is turning.' A barman told last night how he pulled the lifeless body of Aylan from the sea at Golden Beach, Bodrum. Adil Demirtas, 18, who works at the Woxxie hotel, says he saw the toddler's body with that of a another little girl, in pink trousers, when he arrived at work. He and a friend pulled the bodies out of the water on to the sand in horror before calling an ambulance. Mr Demirtas, who has worked at the hotel for three years, was preparing the bar for tourists when his friend shouted out pointing to something in the shallow water. He said: I ran toward it and saw them. I was so afraid. He helped me pull them out of the water.  They looked still alive, like they were sleeping, smiling a little. Their faces and arms and legs looked so new still. They couldn't have been in the water an hour. Their eyes were open. I closed them softly.' The teenage resort worker said he has been profoundly affected by the horrific discovery: I can't eat anything. I couldn't sleep last night. I kept thinking about the two children. I don't have children but my brother has two about the same age and I am very close to them. I will think about it for a long time I think.'  Mr Demirtas said he had swum out to rescue six or seven people after they had fallen in the water in the past few months.  The traffickers choose this stretch of coast because Kos is only a few miles away. © Daily Mail",1

In a stark diagnosis, the European Commission president admitted the single currency and Schengen Agreement could fall in the wake of the Paris attacks and migrant crisis. The Schengen zone, where 26 European countries have removed all checkpoints between each other, has come under pressure as several of the Paris killers were able to move around Europe after entering by posing as Syrian refugees in Greece. In a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Juncker admitted that the agreement - which does not include the UK - was now comatose' after national border checks have been brought back by countries including France, Germany and Sweden. He warned MEPs: We have to safeguard the spirit behind Schengen. Yes, the Schengen system is partly comatose. If the spirit leaves our hearts, we will lose more than Schengen. A single currency does not exist if Schengen fails.'

Jaber Al Bakr was suspected of planning a bomb attack on a Berlin airport. It is believed that the 22-year-old was acting in the name of the Islamic State. The Justice Ministry for the state of Saxony said: ""On the evening of October 12, Jaber Al Bakr, who was suspected of planning a serious attack, took his life in the detention centre at Leipzig correctional hospital."" German news agency DPA reported that he had hanged himself in his cell. Sources in the German justice system said Al Bakr had been under round-the-clock surveillance because he was seen as being at a high risk of committing suicide or going on hunger strike, it was claimed. The would-be bomber had been on the run from German authorities for two days, escaping hours before elite officers raided his home on Friday night in Chemnitz, 50 miles south of Leipzig in eastern Germany. Intelligence forces had warned that he was about to strike and needed to be brought in. Officers found 2lb of a highly unstable explosive in his flat. Al Bakr was turned over to German police by three Syrian refugees he met at the train station in the city on Sunday evening. He had contacted them on an online forum for refugees. He told them that he had just arrived in the country and needed a place to stay. But the refugees recognised him from his wanted picture on social media. After shaving his head at his request, in a bid to conceal his identity, they tied him with computer cable and called the police.

In the event The Donald commented: ""I think they were focused so hard on politics that they didn't get the act together at the end… To end that way was sad."" For which read the President The which read the President of the United States was forced to wipe away tears of laughter before issuing his more in sorrow than anger judgment on the debacle. Just for once, I'm with him all the way. The thespian brigade has always taken itself far too seriously. Marlon Brando, a truly horrible man in every respect, sent a Native American to turn down his Oscar in 1973 for The Godfather. If he'd shown half the concern for his own family that he did for the Apaches, then perhaps one of his sons wouldn't have killed a man or one of his daughters committed suicide. Meryl Streep is a fine actress and not, as far as anyone can tell, a vile human being and yet she bored us all rigid lecturing about Trump a few weeks back. They're just as bad over here.

Three boatloads of refugees who had sailed into Europe across the Aegean Sea were transported back the same way. They were returned under a controversial scheme thrashed out between the Turks and the EU to return hundreds of thousands of people who enter Europe from Turkey via Greece. In an exchange included in last month's deal between Ankara and Brussels, 32 Syrian refugees were flown to Germany from Istanbul. The authorities in all three countries involved said despite opposition to the deal the operations passed off smoothly. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the operation was managed by border security body Frontex with the help of police and migration experts. He said: ""We didn't see unrest or riots. The operation was organised properly."" But in an indication of the diffi-culties facing the project 339 new migrants were picked up arriving in Greece - 50 per cent more than had been sent to Turkey in the preceding 24 hours. Helicopters The returnees were mostly Pakistanis and Afghans who were ferried from Lesbos and Chios to the Turkish town of Dikili. All the boats were accompanied by Turkish coastguard vessels and police helicopters. The Syrians were flown on two separate flights to Hanover, then moved on to Lower Saxony. Further resettlements are planned to Finland and the Netherlands. Under the Turkey-EU deal, Brussels handed the Ankara government £2.2billion in aid, including £500million from Britain. Critics have accused the Turks of using immigration to squeeze money out of Europe and of ""building up muscle"" to force its way into the EU. Human rights groups attacked the deal for sending displaced people back to war-torn regions and not being able to guarantee their safety en route. Gauri van Gulik, of Amnesty International, who was overseeing the Lesbos operation yesterday said Turkey was not safe for the migrants.

It is just like haughty superluvvie Emma to utter contempt for the people but let us eat cake.

If Emma despises Britain so much, well, there is nothing keeping her here. GEORGE CloonEy Hollywood idol George Clooney granted an hour recently to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the refugee crisis. Kentuckian Clooney is something of a displaced person himself, owning homes in LA, Italy, Mexico and on the Thames. He is also an A-list philanthropist, anointed by the UN as a ""Messenger of Peace"". German voters must be delighted that their Chancellor is finally listening to ordinary people. You can't find a heartstring-tugging issue these days that does not have a famous entertainer stuck on to it like a sucker fish. RUSSELL Brand Remember him from when he was on the news five times a day? Looked like a camp Che Guevara and sounded like Orville the Duck? The now invisible activist comedian campaigned to dissuade young people from voting in the last general election as a protest against ""the system"" but flip-flopped and endorsed the doomed Miliband ticket at the last moment. Brand earned the contempt of Britain's Left by going to every Leftie demo as promiscuously as he bedded women. HUGH GRANT Famous for cherishing his celebrity privacy, Grant has described himself as a ""reluctant actor"". Fair enough, I am among his reluctant audience. But his strident support for the obnoxious Hacked Off lobby group can't be condoned as the group's demands for harsh press regulation would allow every corrupt organisation and famous hypocrite to make merry without fear of reporters. STEVE CooGan The troubled comedian once appeared on a Labour Party election broadcast to talk about the ""decent"" and ""hard-working"" values his mum and dad had instilled. Certainly the £5,000 in tenners that he once threw on a bed so that his guest, a topless model, could lie on the cash was tangible proof of his hard work. BOB 'n' Bono Back in 1985 two singers, Bob Geldof and Bono, became the Wright brothers of celebrity activism when they launched Band Aid to raise funds for famine-struck Ethiopia. ""Do they know it's Christmas?"" They certainly did: 60 per cent of Ethiopians are Christian. Band Aid and the many relief efforts modelled on it since then have been trenchantly criticised by African anti-poverty campaigners for their patronising ignorance and the damage they do alongside the good. Then there was the song itself. Mancunian misery-singer Morrissey complained: ""One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia but it is another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of Great Britain."" Bono still sees Band Aid through rose-tinted glasses. And he still has a formidable reputation for sending money abroad, notably by moving his assets from his Irish homeland to more tax-effi-cient locations. He says his tax arrangements are ""sensible"". Sir Bob declared last September that he would ""immediately"" take in three families of Syrian refugees at his various homes but there is no news of how they are settling in. JAMIE OLIVER Oliver's campaign against rubbish school meals was well-intentioned but if Britain worked properly, trading standards officers and school governors would have sorted things out, not a celebrity cook. His involvement helped to unleash the forced gentrification of children's food - ""Oh, not kale croutons again, Miss!"" - and a regime of nutritional correctness in schools with teachers searching lunch boxes for contraband grub. Just this week I saw a pizza in a supermarket freezer marked ""school compliant pizza"". Emma WaTson Emma Watson, the actress still best known as Hermione from the Harry Potter films, made a stirring speech in 2014 to launch HeForShe, a campaign to recruit male allies for women's rights. It is a project of UN Women, a tentacle of the vast United Nations bureaucracy, expensively assisted by blue-chip advertising firms and copywriters. The campaign website invites you to ""make the HeForShe commitment"" by committedly clicking on a box. I did, bringing UK male supporters to a healthy 40,542. Iceland has a proportionately whacking 10,000 and Tunisia, room for improvement with 200. Some cultures might be deterred by the declaration that: ""HeFor-She believes gender isn't binary"" with the option to write down your own definition of your gender. Emma is clearly trapped in a mystic maze of marketing. Wait, there may be a spell: ""Resignio!"" BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH A privately-educated progressive, who was honoured last year as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire Cumberbatch is a much-admired actor, activist and the living definition of having one's cake and eating it. Last year while playing Hamlet at the Barbican he detained his audience after the curtain call, speechifying and swearing about Government refugee policy. While denouncing the treatment of non-white actors in a US television interview he referred to people as ""coloured"" and was himself denounced by fellow liberals. Having studied Hamlet, he must know those lines from Act 3 Scene 4: ""Tis sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard!"" CHARLOTTE ChurCh The ""Voice of an Angel"" Welsh singer has swapped microphone for megaphone to become one of Britain's leading anti-austerity shouters. Charlotte is one of those wealthy socialists who would ""like to pay more tax"". She says: ""I would happily pay more. I would totally be happy if it was raised to 60 or 70 per cent."" When baited by uncouth people who suggest that she could always volunteer more money to the Treasury she argues that doing so would not inspire the rich to do the same. She and other rich Lefties seem to think they know better than Gandhi who said: ""Be the change you wish to see."" When as a guest on Question Time she suggested that climate change was the cause of the Syrian civil war Charlotte brought the audience to its first-ever collective gulp of embarrassment. lEonardo DICAPRIO The final bow must go to actor, environmental activist and UN Messenger of Peace, Leonardo DiCaprio: ""I will fly around the world doing good for the environment.""

Ryan Bogues has been making treats which he leaves in an honesty box - Ryan's Cookie Box - outside his home. He has raised thousands of pounds for charities and was recognised recently in a youth awards ceremony in Newry. Squishy brownies, Malteser buns, Ryan's long and winding rocky road and his grandmother's favourite lemon drizzle cake come wrapped in seasonal decorations. The 21-year-old, from Ballynahinch, Co Down, has built a long list of followers on social media and derailed a few diets. His mum Hazel Bogues said: ""It is about demonstrating these kids can do something wonderful and that they bring something wonderful. ""There is not an ounce of badness in him, he is very pure. He has such a strong moral compass that he would put the rest of us to shame."" Every day, Ryan, who has mobility difficulties due to a problem with his leg, produces baked goods with the help of his family and deposits them in the honesty box outside his home. In return well-wishers leave money and notes of encouragement. Ryan has been collecting money since primary school - pennies which went to Trocaire, as well as hundreds of pounds for charities which tackle homelessness and help cancer patients. He recently won the Youth And Future Talent Awards, which are run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council, jokingly dubbed Northern Ireland's Baftas by Ryan's family. Hazel added: ""The achievements of the young people who had been nominated would put a song in your heart and give great optimism for the future."" Ryan's two main charities are Marie Curie cancer care and Medecins Sans Frontieres. A close family member died from the disease recently and he also wants to recognise international medical efforts in wartorn or impoverished regions. Ryan has also raised money to help address the Syrian refugee crisis and earned more than £500 last month to tackle homelessness. The family uses Facebook to raise awareness and help provide accountability for the money. irish@mgn.co.uk Graphic   HONEST WORK Ryan Bogues with cookie box at home in Co Down",0

The Prime Minister yesterday urged them to not ""take a view because of what your constituency association might say"" over the looming referendum on whether to remain inside the EU. It came as he faced a barrage of criticism from backbenchers after agreeing a draft deal on EU reform. Surveys show most Tory activists support a Brexit, or British exit. Labour MP Chris Bryant said he has already spoken to three Tory MPs who will vote Out, despite wanting In to win. Mr Cameron told his MPs: ""Do what's in your heart. If you think it's right for Britain, then do that. ""Don't take a view because of what your constituency association might say, or you're worried about a boundary review, or you think it might be advan-tageous this way or that way."" But in his first Parliamentary appearance since agreeing the draft deal with Brussels, he came under fire from 23 Tory MPs over compromises on migrant benefits. A Sky News poll found more than two-thirds of people, 69%, think the PM got a bad deal, with Bernard Jenkin, Harwich and North Essex MP, blasting it as ""male bovine excrement"". Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for North East Somerset, added: ""The thin gruel has been further watered down. While Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the negotiations ""a Tory Party drama that's being played out in front of us"". Mr Cameron tried to woo wavering Mayor of London Boris Johnson with plans to negotiate a law asserting Parliament's dominance over Brussels. And he will use today's conference in London on Syrian refugees to hold further reform talks with EU leaders. But French President Francois Hollande last night said Britain ""cannot veto"" policies decided by eurozone countries. In a further blow, EU Parliament chief Martin Schulz will reportedly tell No10 new laws are not ""legally possible"" until MEPs agree to them.

After four decades travelling the globe, revered Sunday Mirror photo journalist John Alevroyiannis documented his own battle against cancer. It was a fight he would not win. We lost our brave colleague, just 61, last Wednesday. And today we are proud to show a few of his memorable pictures - plus the poignant last photo of his extraordinary life. Affectionately known as John The Greek, he captured the most remarkable moments. From the first kiss between newlyweds Prince William and Kate to the reunion between a Syrian refugee and his daughter, John's pictures brought the world to life. He made his subjects totally relaxed. Princess Diana was always happy to pose for him because he called her ""Sweetie"". Vicky Balch, 21, who lost a leg in the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash, beamed happily - while BGT favourites Stavros Flatley shared a chuckle with kindred spirit John. Once, while covering a day in the life of a maternity ward in Croydon, he emerged in surgical scrubs having persuaded a couple to let him photograph the entire labour. Warzones and refugee camps were John's regular stomping ground and he was fearless in his pursuit of the perfect frame. He infiltrated a dog-fighting gang and ended up with two pitbulls called Bonehead and Molly that ran amok in the office. But one of his most memorable moments came a couple of years ago when he managed to coax cancer-stricken Ashya King, then five, to take his first steps since controversial proton treatment in Prague. Reporter Patrick Hill said: ""John began taking photos to relax Ashya, before exclaiming in trademark style, 'I have got an idea'. What followed was remarkable. With John's encouragement, and his mum and dad's support, Ashya stepped down from his bed and took his first steps in two months. ""It was a moment his thrilled parents genuinely thought they may never see."" GUNPOINT John and wife Sarah were once held at gunpoint in Mozambique as he tried to get the perfect shot of Prince Harry. He hastily stuffed five cameras into a toilet cubicle and sweet-talked the local militia into letting them go. It was not his first extraordinary risk in the line of duty. But he could not survive his last assignment after being diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. From his first day of chemotherapy, to a snap taken days before he died, he was determined to keep a pictorial record. Even after he left theatre having had a 10-hour operation he insisted on a picture of him getting to his feet. Last week he walked up a corridor before doing a Greek jig. But hours later sepsis took over his system and he suffered multi-organ failure. John started out on an Athens news agency and came to the UK in 1981. He had two sons - Alexander and Nikolas. Wife Sarah said: ""He adored people and his only fear was dying alone. That never happened. His loved ones held his hand and were by his side."" John's pal Mark Moylan, the Sunday Mirror's head of pictures, said: ""His passion was his job, it was his life. He was the ultimate professional."" And borrowing one of John's Greek expressions - meaning ""cheers!"" - Mark added: ""Stini yassou, John!"" gemma.aldridge@trinitymirror.com Graphic   LAST PICTURE After 10-hour opHUNGRY John keeps his spirits up on day of opINTO BATTLE Starting chemoCARING Di was 'Sweetie' to JohnSO MOVING Dad and refugee girlJohn's snap of Kate and WillsHUMBLING Syrian refugees land in GreeceASSIGNMENT Refugee watch on Greek isleBRAVEST BOY Ashya walked, coaxed by JohnGREEK GURN Laughs with Stavros FlatleyBELTER 'Coaster victim Vicky BalchRED TOP LEGEND Mirror's John was a wine connoisseur",0

The Government's response effectively trebled original plans to accept just 600 people over the next two years. Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald revealed the increase two days after images emerged of threeyear-old Aylan Kurdi's body being washed up on a Turkish beach. She accepted Government ministers failed to keep up with the public outcry over the humanitarian disaster. She said: ""What we have seen is heartbreaking and tragic and I think it demands the most comprehensive response. ""I think it will be in the thousands. It's very hard to put a precise figure on it. We want to respond in as humanitarian a way as possible."" Her comments came as desperate migrants began walking from Hungary's capital Budapest yesterday in the hope of reaching Austria more than 160km away. The refugees said they would do ""anything it takes"" to not have to register for asylum in Hungary. After four days of being forced to camp outside Keteli train station in the capital, men and women gathered their families and what few belongings they have to march across Europe. The Irish Mirror joined the desperate refugees as they left Keteli rail terminus shortly after midday amid cheers of ""Austria, Austria"". For those on the long walk to what they hope will be a new life, this was just the beginning of another leg of their journey. The determined walkers continued their marathon efforts late into the night, stopping sporadically en masse before picking themselves up and walking to what they hope will be freedom. Children clutched dolls and teddy bears as they clung on to their parents' hands. after being refused permission to board trains bound for western Europe. One man, Hamdi Rasha, 28, from warravaged Raqqa in Syria where bloodthirsty Islamic State terrorists have forced locals to flee, told how he rounded up his wife, four-year-old daughter, and six-year-old son from the station underpass to join thousands of his countrymen and other migrants to walk to Austria. Walking sideby-side along the M7 outside Budapest, he said: ""We have no other way, we will do anything it takes. Our homeland is gone, we can never go back there. Where is the help for us? ""The situation is very real. People will die. Many are without food and water but still we will walk together, we will carry each other if needs be."" Ms Fitzgerald said if European leaders agree to increase the number of refugees being accepted across the bloc to 150,000, it will effectively treble Ireland's commitment to the crisis. She added: ""I believe that is a minimum of the response we will be making."" But Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said Ireland should do more than the promised increase and act without EU agreement. He added: ""Europe has responded too slowly and Ireland must lead the way by playing its part. ""The failure to deal with this refugee crisis has dramatically increased the costs of this humanitarian disaster. ""Thousands of people have died already. This is the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two."" Jerry O'Connor, of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, said any increase in the numbers of people accepted in Ireland is welcome. He added: ""It has been clear for some time the figure of 600 was inadequate. ""So now we must ensure that our policy of admitting people to the country is formed with the same generosity of spirit which has seen our Navy rescue 6,000 men, women and children since May. ""It should be recalled that during the Bosnian War we led Europe in terms of accepting refugees and there is no reason why that should not be the case today."" As the refugee crisis grows by the day Germany has agreed to take in and welcome as many as 800,000 people arriving at its borders by the end of the year. Irish Refugee Council chief Sue Conlan said if the Government here were to take a similar approach to Chancellor Angela Merkel then in the region of 40,000 asylum seekers could be accepted. She added: ""It's not dealing with reality. The numbers and the needs are far greater than that. ""We have to find a way to respond to the public sentiment where people in Ireland are saying we can do more and we need to do more."" Meanwhile Independent TD Mattie McGrath called on the Government to bring in a refugee support programme allowing volunteer families to offer accommodation to displaced people.

Just as she does when she judges the ITV show, Amanda asked the youngsters what they would do with their cash prize if they won the competition. But these children did not light up at the thought of going on holiday or helping their local community centres. These kids just wanted their lives back. Because Amanda was watching a very different version of the talent show, one based in a camp housing Syrian refugees who have dodged bombs, bullets and sexual slavery in a desperate bid to flee their war-ravaged homes. Amanda says: ""I basically treated it like the show and joked around with them saying, 'What's your dream?' and, 'The next two minutes will change your life'. The response was like a movie. ""Literally every child kept saying the same thing, 'We want to go back to Syria, we just want to rebuild our homes, we just want our childhoods back, we just want to feel like children again'. ""And obviously that's not a prize that will ever be available to them."" They called the show Zaatari's Got Talent after the refugee camp in Jordan where they now live. There was a banner, judging table and a bell instead of a buzzer. Amanda, 46, says: ""They were so, so good. ""There was a boys' choir who sang a song for Syria and, even though it was in a different language, I understood the sentiment and the song because you could see the emotion in their faces. ""I thought to myself, 'I need to tell Simon Cowell that we need to get a camera into this camp'."" Amanda spent two days in Jordan, visiting the Zaatari camp 25 miles from the Syrian border and the Makani centre in Amman where children get psychological support to help them cope with the trauma they have experienced. Mum-of-two Amanda spoke to 13-year-old Rasha, who fled from her hometown, the Syrian capital Damascus, after her school was hit by a bomb when she was just eight years old. Rasha was in the playground with her best friend when the blast struck. Most of the boys playing football around her were killed - but that was not the worst of it. She saw her best friend with horrendous head injuries, the blood splattering across Rasha's face. Rasha was so traumatised she stood still for a week, stupefied by the death that was now part of her everyday life. But that was not the end of the terror for Rasha. She later saw her mother electrocuted by soldiers and her two brothers were shot. Rasha herself was brutally dragged by her hair and hurled against a wall by soldiers. Her mum suffered numerous strokes as a result of the torture and trauma she endured and now does not recognise Rasha, her youngest child. As Amanda places a sympathetic hand on Rasha's knee, the teenager asked her: ""How can I ever be happy? I've lost everything. I smile, but inside I'm crying. I feel so much pain inside. ""Not only have I lost my friends, but I have lost my mum, who doesn't recognise me, and my family is separated as half my family are in Syria."" Amanda, who was visiting Jordan in October with Save the Children as part of their Christmas Jumper Day appeal, struggled to compred hend the barbarity these children have witnessed. In 2011, she and husband Chris Hughes were devastated when their son was stillborn. She described her grief as ""overwhelming"". Just a year later, she almost died herself giving birth to her youngest daughter Hollie. But the refugee camp was beyond anything Amanda had ever experienced before. She says: ""Obviously I have had my fair share of trauma. But after seeing these people I said, 'Nothing is as important - whether it's a new haircut, or a new car - as my kids' health, my husband, my parents and my family."" We're all alive and love each other and we're together. It made pain inside me think, 'Every woman in the world is a tiger when it comes to protecting and looking after their own children'."" There was one story which really hit home. Hadeel is also a mum of two, and her 11-year-old daughter Ayla is struggling to overcome shyness - just like Amanda's own daughter Lexi, also 11 But the cause of Ayla's shyness is horrific. The trauma of seeing soldiers threaten her family when she was just six years old left Ayla perpetually afraid for her life and struggling to speak. Hadeel, also mum to Yana, eight, was attacked by armed soldiers and frequently saw dead bodies lying in pools of blood on the streets. Ayla was in the camp for year before she had the confidence to speak again. She found the courage to perform a heartfelt song for Amanda, having seen BGT on smartphones. Amanda says: ""They were an amazing family. I really related to Hadeel as she has two daughters too and her daughter had to overcome a great amount of shyness, like Lexi. ""I said to Hadeel, 'How do you find the strength?' And she replied, 'You just have to, as a mother'."" The visit carried on affecting Amanda even when she returned to the UK. She says: ""We get to leave, we get to go and have a hot shower and settle down for the evening. I couldn't stop thinking about that. I felt immensely guilty that I had the choice to do that. ""This time of year it's freezing and their heating consists of big oil drums filled with fire. They are no longer in their homes with their families at Christmas. They literally have nothing."" Amanda found it tough telling Lexi and Hollie, five, about her trip. She bought two dresses for her girls from tailor Faris, 17, who works in the Makani centre. His work must sustain his family of eight, after his father died in Syria. Amanda says: ""These kids learn a lot of skills to prevent them from being taken as sex slaves and all the other horrendous things that can happen. ""Hollie loves her dress. But she couldn't even get her head around the fact that some of these children don't have their mummies and daddies."" But Amanda did take positives from her experience. She says: ""It was amazing to see the sense of community in the camp. The joy inside those buildings in Jordan is overwhelming. ""That sense of family is everything. In moments of trauma, you do think, 'The only thing that's important is my family, their health and our love for each other'.""

I'd love to say it was all my idea, but the mother-in-law arrived at my home, straight from church, on a wave of Christian generosity. After much work, almost 16 bin bags had been gathered up and I have to say I was embarrassed at how much we had lying around not being used. I posted a picture of the mountain on Twitter to hopefully encourage others to do similar only to have a woman denounce my action as a disgrace. According to this 'lady', all such donations should be going to 'locals'. Going further she stated my actions were 'supporting incoming terrorists'. I have to admit, even as someone pretty used to online abuse, this tirade took my breath away. I know people holding such beliefs are out there, but when you see their deranged thinking in print, it all becomes horrifically real. If proof were needed of our indigenous loons, around 40 of them took part in an anti-immigration rally at Belfast City Hall last Saturday.

The European single market has been hijacked by politicians who don't care if individual countries lose their identities, so it is now good to see resistance to this madness. The EU and our political class are obsessed with ""free movement"". Only by voting to leave the EU can we defend the UK we love in the long term. RICHARD MCCAULEY Hornsey, North London GERMANY opened its borders to all and sundry, while stating that Britain should take in more migrants. Now it has now had no option but to put the barriers up due to the influx, which was much higher than German leader Andrea Merkel, pictured, anticipated. It was obvious that, the easier it was for these people to get into Europe, the more would arrive. SANDRA QUEEN Church Langley, Essex SO Angela Merkel wakes up to the fact that welcoming all these alleged Syrian refugees might also be allowing IS infiltrators into Europe. Our Prime Minister David Cameron should now insist we regain full control of our borders too. BARRY HARBERT Shanklin, Isle of Wight GIVEN the mass numbers of migrants piling into Europe, you didn't need to be that smart to realise that limits on the numbers would be reimposed - and that the open-border policy would be a thing of the past, sadly. All over Europe it seems the checks on border numbers have had to be brought in. JACK AMER Gorleston, Norfolk THE only reason migrants head for Europe is that they can go to their country of choice once they are inside the EU. But now Germany has closed its borders. Hallelujah! If all EU countries do the same, and we drop the open-border policy, it will stem the migrant flow at a stroke. ROB BETTISON Mansfield, Notts I AM saddened to see the plight of the refugees from Syria. To have to flee the country for fear of death is something I can't imagine.

I've just had a flick through my old notepads, reminding myself what I've been up to over the past twelve months. In the most part, they read like the script of some awful disaster movie. But there was the occasional ray of sunshine to break up all the gloom. For me, 2015 began in the ebola camps of Sierra Leone. Remember ebola? The virus we feared might wipe us all out, and struck down Scots nurse Pauline Cafferkey, below. Well, the epidemic did claim a dreadful number of lives. But it also taught us that with cool heads, a bit of education and only the basic medical care, even the nastiest of diseases can be contained. Keeping a lid on Vladimir Putin, by contrast, proved more of a challenge. In February I found myself on the wrong end of Russian shelling in Ukraine. That nasty little conflict has dropped from the headlines over 2015. It's Europe's forgotten war. I reckon it'll flare up again next year. But more about my predictions later. Back at home, May saw perhaps the most astonishing general election in living memory. Labour got whacked on both sides of the border, as did the pollsters. Just think, twelve months ago people were predicting Ed Miliband would be running the country just now. Jeremy Corbyn was just a wild eyed loner on the back benches (as opposed to being a wild eyed loner on the front benches), and even Nicola Sturgeon wouldn't have dared to dream of a virtual wipeout of the Scottish constituencies. It's been champagne ever since for the SNP, of course, while Scottish Labour's year would be better summed up by an empty bottle of whisky and a stinking hangover. This year's election was remarkable in many ways, not least because it was one of the few big stories of 2015 that wasn't, somehow, linked to ISIS. We'd barely heard of that group of lunatics eighteen months ago, now the whole world knows their name. Well, actually, it can't decide what they're called, but that's an argument for another day. They've inspired murder on the streets of Paris, killed tourists on the beaches of Tunisia, brought down a passenger jet over Sharm El Sheikh. In fact, more broadly speaking, they've changed the whole of Europe, perhaps forever. The image that will live with me longer than any other from the past twelve months was the terror in the eyes of Syrian refugees as they spilled out of boats onto the beaches of Lesbos. Even in the dead of night they braved rough seas in flimsy inflatables to reach a continent they thought would offer safety. Standing there as they landed, it was terrifying to watch. Migrants, refugees, call them what you like. A million of them came to Europe this year, many escaping the clutches of the so called Islamic State. It's a complicated business and it stirs up a lot of emotions. Europe is still suffering the after-effects of a crippling financial crisis after all and goodwill is in short supply. The new arrivals are being painted as a drain on resources by some and a security threat by others. To be honest, I'm not sure they care. Anything's better than being back in Syria. But for a lesson in proper, weapons-grade xenophobia, we need only look across the pond. I arrived in the United States a couple of days after the San Bernardino shootings and spent the next fortnight chas-ing Donald Trump across the country. It was exhausting, entertaining and illuminating at the same time. I learned a lot about the USA on that trip. And you know what, it's learning a lot about itself just now, too. Next year's presidential elections are a big moment, not just for America, but for all of us. So, there we are, 2015. A right old barrel of laughs, eh? Still, ""don't have nightmares"" as Nick Ross used to say. And just remember, the good stuff rarely makes the headlines. As well as looking back, this is a good time of year to look forward, to imagine what the coming twelve months may have in store. Whatever your plans for Hogmanay, have a great evening and a happy new year. May 2016 bring us all health, wealth and - most importantly - happiness. Labour got whacked",0

So began the matter-of-fact news report last week of what appeared to be just another victim of London's chaotic roads. But this 73-year-old, hit by a double-decker bus on the capital's busiest shopping street, was no ordinary OAP. She was Baroness Marion Lambert, an art collector and philanthropist whose tragic end, four days after the accident, concluded a life story that is as shocking as it is sad. Her death called time on a personal crusade for justice that had consumed her ever since her daughter Philippine killed herself after claiming a family friend raped and sexually abused her as a child. Marion's torment drove her to collect mountains of evidence against Philippine's alleged attacker and even hand out leaflets to a theatre audience telling them of his alleged actions. Philippine was just 20 when she took her own life in 1997. In a note she named millionaire Vincent Meyer, who has links to the Royal Family, as her alleged abuser. She wrote: ""I want Vincent Meyer to pay for having sexually abused me from the age of 12 to 14 and go to jail for the rest of his life."" The last words of her daughter stayed with Marion for almost two decades and she made it her mission to fulfil her final wish. Speaking in 2001, Marion revealed: ""This has wrecked our lives. Totally. That man betrayed everything, loyalty, friendship, hospitality and innocence. 'She loved the attention of a grown-up' ""What people don't realise is that abuse undermines the foundations a child. In my daughter's case, it her life."" s of cost high es at "" The scandal rocked Europe'ssociety, with two banking empires its heart. restiand Meyer, 64, was born into the prestigious Lazard FrÈres dynasty and inherited a fortune that afforded a lifestyle of the super-rich. him when and ding e in He met the Lamberts in 1988, he was in the midst of a divorce, became a trusted friend, spending time with them at their home Geneva, Switzerland. and work, hone He grew close to Philippine would help her with her homework, read poems to her down the phone and dance with her at parties. - a mily was Marion and husband Philippe - a descendent of Belgian banking family Brussels Lambert - believed itinnocent fun. eness ming ghter But it is claimed Meyer's closeness to Philippine was part of a grooming campaign that led to their daughter being abused for three years. ame nd he -Marion, whose own family came from a world of wealth and privilege, recalled: ""She loved the attention of a grown-up, of someone who treated her as special. ""He was a lonely, almost childish man who filled his life with toys, be it women or planes or vintage cars, and he always seemed grateful to be in the middle of our family and social circle."" e."" The alleged abuse is said to have ended when Philippine was 15 after her parents cut ties with Meyer who, according to Marion, was ""always asking for something"", causing them to fall out. ,, Philippine spiralled into a long battle with anorexia and depression. She self-med and attempted to take her life three times. harm own He alleg happ said ho wo sh tHer diary revealed the level of the ged abuse. Writing as if it pened in the third person, she d: ""He undressed her and was olding her naked body when she oke up. She was so terrified when he realised what was happening hat she pretended to be asleep."" A week before her death in August 1997, the heiress decided to take action against Meyer and told her solicitor about the alleged abuse. She also confided in her mum. But unburdening her alleged ordeal was not enough to save her. Two days later she was dead. Determined to get justice, Marion used the family fortune to start the legal proceedings her daughter had longed for and gathered evidence including court reports, expert opinion and books on child grooming. Marion said of her quest for justice: ""It takes character, determination and money. You have to be rich."" Meyer was arrested in Switzerland in December 1997 for rape, sexual misconduct toward a minor and involuntary homicide. He was remanded in custody for three months but released on bail of £2.5million, a Swiss record. He strenuously denied the charges, claiming Philippine's allegations were the fabrication of an emotionally unstable young woman. He admitted having a ""beautiful and affectionate relationship"" with her but insisted it was never sexual. In 2000 the charges were dropped after the Swiss public prosecutor ruled a lack of evidence and that some of the allegations had reached the five-year statute of limitations. The charge of involuntary homicide was not pursued by the Lamberts. The ruling was later upheld by the Swiss court of appeal. 'I would trust Vincent with my life' Meyer went on to marry Elizabeth Stuart, niece of the Earl of Moray. He cemented himself in London high society by becoming president of the London Philharmonia Orchestra, of which Prince Charles is a patron. The Lambert family never came to terms with the fact he had not been tried in court. Philippe, who died in 2011, reportedly attacked Meyer in a Geneva street in 2004. A year later, Marion went so far as to hand out leaflets bearing a reminder of his dark history at a Philharmonia Orchestra concert being held in West London. Yet many in their social circle sided with Meyer and accused the baroness of pursuing a vendetta. One friend said: ""I have known him for 20 years and would trust him with my life."" Meyer refused to comment when contacted by The Sun last night. Marion planned to write a book about her daughter's alleged ordeal. It never came to light. Over the years her fight took a different turn and instead she spent her time raising millions for various charities, including the NSPCC. She gave her support when the charity helped launch a network of special investigation centres to bring paedophiles to justice and help victims. But Philippine's death was never far from her thoughts. She amassed a huge art collection which was ""a way of coming to terms with life"". Last month she featured on the BBC2's The Extraordinary Collector, which focused on the sale of more than 300 pieces from her collection, including works by Andy Warhol. The total lot fetched nearly £15million, with the money earmarked for charity. On the day of her death, the baroness had been on her way to meet her good friend, auctioneer Simon de Pury, to talk about how the art world could help the Syrian refugee crisis. Paying tribute to her, Simon said: ""I don't think anyone can ever get closure on losing a child. She did so much to raise money for the NSPCC and other charities after."" Graphic   TRAUMA ...

682,src_thesun_raw.docx,The Sun,6/9/2015,722 words,CRAIG WOODHOUSE,We've got four days to save Labour from a decade in wilderness; SUNDAY ISSUE the EX-MINISTER APPEALS FOR VOTES AHEAD OF THURSDAY'S ELECTION,Tabloid,"Says YVETTE COOPER MP and Leadership Candidate EXCLUSIVE By CRAIG WOODHOUSE Political Correspondent SURGING Yvette Cooper today warns Labour members they have four days to save the party from a decade in the electoral wilderness under Jeremy Corbyn. The mum-of-three has issued a lastditch plea for support ahead of Thursday's voting deadline in the race to replace Ed Miliband. Ms Cooper has the vital momentum in the final days of the Labour leadership election after her brave call for Britain to open its arms to more Syrian refugees caught the public mood. It has boosted her chances of stopping socialist firebrand Mr Corbyn from pulling off a shock victory. With up to half of votes believed to be still up for grabs, Ms Cooper set out a stark choice between years of bitter infighting and irrelevance under Mr Corbyn or an immediate plan for a Labour fightback if she wins. In an exclusive interview with The Sun on Sunday, the Shadow Home Secretary said: ""I think part of the reason a lot of people haven't voted until late on is because they really wanted to think about this carefully. ""There are now four days that will decide the next ten years because it will decide how strong we are in opposition. But it will also decide what our chances are of winning the next election. It is a really big choice."" Many Labour moderates are terrified of a Corbyn victory and are already drawing up plans to oppose or oust him. And supporters of the bearded leftie are plotting to kick out Blairite MPs and mount a socialist takeover of the party. Ms Cooper, a former minister who had a front-row seat for the feuding of the Blair-Blairvote Brown years, is worried Labour will be so focused on fighting itself if he wins it will give Cameron's Tory Government a free ride. She said: ""We can't let that happen. I think I would be the strongest person to hold the party together, to have the ideas for the future."" Talking in her House of Commons office, Ms Cooper insists she wants to make a ""positive"" case to win votes. She has four key pledges for her leadership ... l To create two million jobs in sectors such as technology and by doubling investment in science. l To support families by extending free child care and protecting Sure Start centres. l To protect public services such as the police and nursing from cuts. l To boost wages for jobs like social care. 'It's got to be about real hope not false promise' She insists it's a pitch that can win back voters who deserted Gordon Brown or Ed Miliband's Labour to for the Tories, SNP or Ukip - in sharp contrast to the divisive agenda pushed by Mr Corbyn. vote Ms Cooper, 46, said: ""I don't think it's about going back to the 1970s. It's got to be about the future. It has got to be about real hope not false promise."" Ms Cooper has been scathing about Mr Corbyn's ""dodgy economics"", printing money to pay for major projects and vowing to nationalise major industries, and brands the fight to stop him ""a battle for the soul of our party"". It appears to be paying off in her bid to win the Labour crown. Bookies make her second favourite behind Mr Corbyn, ahead of Andy Burnham and Liz Kendall. The daughter of a union official, Ms Cooper was elected in 1997 as Tony Blair swept Labour to power and she believes she has the reach to reunite the party after a bruising contest. That includes the thousands of supporters who have paid £3 membership fees to vote in the contest, many of them Corbyn backers. Asked what would be top of her in-tray if she is leader next Sunday, Ms Cooper replied: ""First thing is to pull the party together again. And that means making the most of the energy - we have got lots of new people joining the party, that is a really good thing."" Criss-crossing the country in the four-month contest has taken its toll on Ms Cooper - and kept her away from a holiday with ex-MP husband Ed Balls and their three children. Whatever the result, Ms Cooper will be dealing with a challenge familiar to every parent after the results are announced on Saturday - getting kids Ellie, 16, Joel, 14 and Maddy, 11, off to school as the new term kicks into full swing. She said: ""That's what keeps your feet on the ground. This is the final weekend of campaigning and I'm thinking both about what meetings we are going to do but also what time does Clarks close to get some school shoes."" Graphic   DOWN NOT OUT...

She insisted that the programme to bring 20,000 Syrian refugees direct to Britain over the next five years and the fact the country is the second largest aid donor to refugee camps in countries neighbouring Syria was a record to be proud of.  Related: Conservative asylum policy on Syria 'too low, too slow, too narrow' The senior lawyers denounced the offer of 20,000 places in the face of the largest refugee crisis since the second world war as ""too low, too slow and too narrow"", adding that Britain had lost its way as a nation that once had a reputation as a haven for refugees. The home secretary made clear that she rejected the lawyers' demand that Britain takes its fair share of those refugees who have reached Europe. She even appealed to opposition MPs to join her in ""sending a clear message"" to the refugees not to try to travel across the Mediterranean to Europe ""because people are dying making that journey"". May angered opposition MPs during Home Office questions at the Commons on Monday as it quickly became clear she intended to leave detailed questions about the crisis to her newly appointed minister for refugees, Richard Harrington. It was left to him to explain that the Home Office had given way to guarantee longer-term funding for refugees who come to Britain, after strong pressure from local government during several weeks of talks. The government had said it would use overseas aid funding to meet the extra costs of the 20,000 Syrian refugees to be brought under a special vulnerable persons resettlement scheme. But it quickly became clear that while the refugees are to come for a minimum of five years, the extra money would only be available for the first 12 months, leaving many local authorities reluctant to take part. Harrington confirmed to MPs that it had now been agreed that central government funding would also cover the extra costs involved in resettling the Syrians selected under the scheme all the way into the fifth year. The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, and the Scottish nationalists both spoke to Home Office ministers about the criticisms in the statement by senior legal figures, printed in full-page adverts in the Guardian and the Times.  Related: Theresa May speech marks new low in politics of migration Burnham added his own criticism of May's conference speech attack, which labelled those refugees and migrants who made it to Europe as the ""fittest and wealthiest"", telling her it was desperation rather than fitness or wealth that was driving them to make the hazardous journey across the Mediterranean. The clash came after the UN security council endorsed a British resolution last Friday authorising the use of naval force to intercept and seize the migrant boats located in the seas off Libya. A Royal Naval frigate, HMS Richmond, is part of the European naval force called Operation Sophia which will begin blockading the north African coast to prevent the flow of refugees and migrants to Europe.",1

The foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said it was possible that the United Nations might pass a security council resolution on Friday paving the way for a ceasefire between President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian rebel forces. Hammond said it was more likely that the talks in New York, which are bringing together all the key partners, might reach agreement on an end to the use of indiscriminate weapons in civilian areas, an end to the bombing of hospitals and medical facilities, and a guarantee of humanitarian access to besieged areas on both sides of the conflict.  Russia is likely to veto any security council resolution that has wording implying that Assad might have to stand aside at the end of a ceasefire and reconciliation process.  Related: Theresa May defends government response to Syrian refugee crisis Discussing Britain's contribution to the Syrian refugee crisis, Cameron said two planes carrying refugees arrived at Stansted and Belfast on Tuesday, and another was expected on Wednesday, meaning the prime minister will have just met his pledge to resettle 1,000 people before Christmas. Cameron has faced intense pressure from the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and others to allow more refugees from the five-year civil war into the UK, especially since parliament voted to join the bombing campaign against Isis. The government has said it will allow 20,000 Syrians to settle in the UK over the course of five years, but that pales by comparison with countries such as Germany, which is expected to take in more than a million refugees this year alone. Announcing that his target has been met, Cameron said: ""Britain is doing its moral duty in terms of funding the refugees and the refugee camps. I made a promise that we would resettle a thousand Syrians by Christmas, and I can confirm today we have met our commitment. The charter flights that arrived yesterday at Stansted and Belfast mean that over a thousand have been settled, and another flight is coming today. ""The government has provided funding so that all these refugees get housing, healthcare, education, and I want to thank all the local authorities and all those who have worked so hard. I said that Britain would do its duty and with these 1,000, we've made a very good start."" The Syrians have been arriving over the last three months and are being distributed among local authorities, along with almost 2,000 Syrians who were granted asylum in the last year. The government has repeatedly argued that it does not want to take refugees who have made their own way to Europe because it does not want to encourage more displaced people to undertake dangerous journeys across the sea. In the Commons, Hammond provided an update on the military and diplomatic position in Syria and said it was unacceptable that the Russian air campaign was still targeting Syrian rebel forces rather than Isis. He said the Russian air campaign was weakening the opposition, but on a more optimistic note, he said finance ministers from 15 countries will meet in New York on Thursday to pass a UN resolution tightening oil sanctions against Isis. It will be the first time that 15 finance ministers have met in this context. Hammond admitted that the Foreign Office does not know what the Russian strategy is in Syria. ""We do not know what Russia's objectives are, and my assessment is that most people in the Russian system do not either. Perhaps Mr Putin has in his head an idea about what the endgame is,"" he said. Hammond also revealed that the UK ""has created a coalition communications cell that is working to combat and undermine the Daesh 'brand', ensuring that no communications space currently exploited by Daesh is left uncontested"".

Organisers want the aid to be diverted from food handouts towards work and education opportunities for Syrians in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.  Related: Syrian children need an education - rich countries must give $1.4bn to fund it | Malala Yousafzai and Muzoon Almellehan British officials acknowledge that unless refugees are offered the possibility of a better life both in and outside the camps, there is an increased risk that they will fall prey to extremism or give up waiting to return to their homeland, instead making the perilous journey to Europe. There is also a growing acceptance that host countries neighbouring Syria cannot carry the burden without substantially more help.  David Cameron, Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of Norway and Kuwait have jointly convened the conference to be held on Thursday. They have pointed out that the 2015 appeal for Syrian refugees failed to meet half its targets or pledges, and say that in 2016 the goal must be to get 1 million more Syrians into education and tens of thousands into jobs by offering them work permits.  Syria's neighbours, who have hosted 4.6 million refugees between them, have seen their labour markets badly disrupted and have been reluctant to offer permits. The UN children's agency has said that $1.4bn will be needed to rescue what could become a lost generation both in Syria and in exile. Delegates at a European Bank of Reconstruction Development conference on Wednesday will discuss how the private sector can boost investment in Lebanon and Turkey. The voices of refugees will be heard at a civil society conference attended by the UK's international development secretary, Justine Greening. The London conference is expected to discuss the lack of humanitarian access inside Syria and will spill over into discussions of domestic Syrian politics and how to end the nearly five-year war there.   Related: Syrian refugees in Jordan: 'If they cut the coupons, we will probably die' The official opposition delegation - in Geneva for stuttering peace talks - is insisting it will not participate until sieges and an increasingly intensive Russian bombing campaign come to a halt. The delegation says Russia is using the cover of the talks to buy time to strengthen the position of the Syrian government on the battlefield.  The UN Syrian envoy overseeing the talks, Staffan de Mistura, has warned that the talks may collapse. He said on Tuesday: ""If there is a failure this time after we tried twice at conferences in Geneva, for Syria there will be no more hope."" Rebel supply lines into the northern city of Aleppo are being targeted by Russia in what looks like an attempt to encircle the city and close the narrow corridors that provide supplies from Turkey. The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has repeatedly attacked the Russian bombing campaign, saying the strikes are aimed at Syrian rebels and not Islamic State positions. Ahead of Thursday's conference, the Norwegian Refugee Council published new data showing how Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan are coming under pressure from host governments that are in turn running out of resources to help.   The council said:  · In Lebanon, an estimated 70% of the refugee population, that is more than 700,000 people, has lost the legal right to stay, making it more difficult to access schooling or work permits. · In Jordan, some 250,000 Syrian refugees are still estimated to be without an updated government registration.

The poll, taken by Lonergan Research on Tuesday night, also found a majority of Australians still supported the government's Operation Sovereign Borders asylum program, including its commitment to asylum seeker boat turnbacks and offshore detention.  Thousands of Australians have attended vigils around the country urging the government to allow additional Syrian refugees into the country in response to the images of mass refugee flight across Europe and of the body of Alan Kurdi washed up in Turkey, but as recently as Sunday prime minister Tony Abbott was insisting any additional Syrian refugees would have to come from within this year's humanitarian intake of 13,750. Asked by Lonergan Research whether Australia should increase its intake of refugees, 57% answered yes and 43% said no. Asked to rate the Abbott government's response to the refugee crisis in Syria and the Middle East, 54% said it was poor and 46% rated it as good.  Related: Calls to prioritise Christian refugees are discriminatory - Australia's grand mufti But despite the rapidly changing sentiment regarding refugees from Syria a clear majority still backed the government's overall asylum policies. Asked whether they supported Operation Sovereign Borders, which includes turning back boats and offshore detention of asylum seekers, 54% per cent said they backed it and 46% were opposed. Both major parties went to the last election promising that no asylum seekers arriving by boat would be resettled in Australia and all would be processed offshore, and a Lowy Institute poll taken last year showed 71% of those surveyed backed the policy of turning back boats. But voters' views for or against the Coalition's policy appear strongly held. Fifty-five per cent said the Liberal party's stance on refugees and asylum seekers made them less likely to vote for them at the next election and 45% said the policy made them more likely to vote for the Coalition.

""I was told that 92% of people stay less than four months but I have heard of people being held for several years in migrant detention [centres in Britain].

But the US is a diverse society now - and mobilising to oppose radical haters",Broadsheet,"So now we know. Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Considering the Islamophobia of Trump's campaign up until now, some terrible months lie ahead for Muslim Americans. But I won't be intimidated by Trump. In fact, this is an exciting turn of events. Trump was never alone in his Islamophobia, and most of the other Republican candidates for president of the United States had also expressed alarmist ideas regarding Muslim Americans. Ted Cruz called on police to patrol ""Muslim neighbourhoods"". Ben Carson stated that a Muslim would ""have to reject the tenets of Islam"" before becoming president. Chris Christie said that the United States should not admit any new Syrian refugees, not even ""orphans under the age of five"".  Related: Sadiq Khan: I don't want exemption from 'ignorant' Trump's Muslim ban But Trump's Islamophobia has always been different because his campaign is different. The thuggish threat of violence that accompanies it, at times openly courted by the orange-dusted billionaire, transforms his vague and unenforceable platforms into excuses for roaming vigilantes around the country to bust some heads. The threats and ridicule have not only been levied against Muslims, but also Mexicans, women, African Americans, the undocumented, the differently abled and so many others. On the same day that Trump secured the Republican nomination, leaflets were left on parked cars in Sacramento, California, calling for a fight ""to prevent the genocide of white peoples by both Islam and Mexico"". The leaflets urged ""white resistance groups and lone wolves"" to ""kidnap, rob, torture for information and execute all Muslims and Latinos. Leave no survivors."" This may be the obscene ravings of some lunatic crank, but the mix of Muslim and Mexican in the age of Trump is unmistakable. This could get worse, but we should not be naive about the amount of violence that his campaign has already stoked. Earlier this month, Georgetown University released a study of Islamophobia during the presidential season thus far. The report found that since March 2015, when the first Republican candidate (Ted Cruz) announced his bid for the White House, there had already been about 180 reported incidents of anti-Muslim violence across the US, including 12 murders, 34 physical assaults, 56 acts of vandalism, nine arsons and eight shootings or bombings, among other incidents. The context of these horrific numbers is complicated with the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino and the Syrian refugee crisis, and the report acknowledges this, but it is also worth noting that anti-Muslim sentiment in America has tended to spike at predictable times. According to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, which has charted polling data regarding anti-Muslim sentiment since 9/11, the largest spikes do not track with high-profile terrorist attacks but occur during presidential election cycles, this one being no exception.

His corrosive comments on Muslims and Mexicans will only bring Muslims and Mexicans, and everyone else, closer together. The shameful, divisive campaign that Trump is running may be mobilising one type of voter to his side - primarily the angry white voter - but you can no longer win the presidency on angry white votes alone. Mitt Romney won the white vote handily in 2012 and still lost the general election badly. This is a different country than Trump voters understand it to be. The 2016 election will see the country's most racially and ethnically diverse electorate ever, with nearly one in three (31%) of eligible voters being non-white, according to the Pew Research Center. Muslims and Latinos are already actively seeking to register more voters than ever, and expect Muslim voter registration to really take off in June, during Ramadan, when Islamic centres will be full of congregants. Latino voter registration is already skyrocketing. Even more fundamentally is the organising energy I see from young Muslim Americans and so many others determined not to let their country be taken over by radical haters. What I've never seen - and don't expect to see - are Muslims cowering in fear of Trump. He may never have expected it, but Trump is helping to build the strongest, most multicultural, multifaith, and multi-ethnic America we have ever had. So, thank you, Donald.

Why?; The American public needs to know the real reasons behind the arbitrary list of states,Broadsheet,"When President Trump issued Executive Orders limiting immigration on Friday, it appears there was at least one important omission. He has failed to instruct the National Park Service to put a hood over the Statue of Liberty, the world's most renowned symbol of freedom. It is not the only omission. In identifying Muslim-majority countries from which refugees and visas will be blocked because of concerns about terrorism, President Trump left out Saudi Arabia. Yet most of those who hijacked airliners to attack New York and Washington, DC on September 11, 2001, the deadliest terrorist episode in history, were Saudis. Does President Trump shy away from offending Saudi Arabia because he has business dealings with wealthy Saudis? Or because he expects them to curry favor by patronizing his new hotel in Washington? We don't know. By refusing to release his tax returns and by refusing to divest himself of his businesses, he raises such questions. Another country left off the list is Egypt. Yet the leader of the 9/11 hijackers was Mohammed Atta, an Egyptian. Was Egypt omitted because President Trump is developing a warm relationship with the country's brutal dictator, General Abdel Fattah el Sisi? Again, we don't know.  Related: Donald Trump's executive order means he is now officially gunning for Muslims | Moustafa Bayoumi Of course, excluding all Saudis and Egyptians from entering the United States is a bad idea. Applicants for refugee status or visas should be considered individually. Yet failing to exclude them highlights the arbitrariness of barring all those from some countries whose nationals have had no part in terrorism in the United States. During his campaign, Trump focused particularly on excluding Syrian refugees, calling them ""the ultimate Trojan horse."" It must be acknowledged that despite the extreme suffering they have endured, the United States was not especially welcoming of Syrian refugees before President Trump took office. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has registered more than 4,800,000 Syrian refugees. The great majority are in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The Obama Administration proposed to admit 25,000 Syrian refugees to the United States in the year beginning October 1. President Trump has now halted that process. Meanwhile Canada has announced that it resettled 39,617 Syrian refugees by January 2, 2017. The process has gone very well. Many thousands of Canadians are voluntarily helping the refugees and contributing financially to enable them to adjust successfully to their new environment. Before accepting the Syrian refugees, Canada vetted them with care. So far, there have been no security issues. The vetting by the United States before Syrian refugees are accepted for resettlement has been similar, and has taken up to two years. As in the case of Canada, the United States has had no security incidents involving Syrian refugees.  Related: The travel ban protests demonstrate the power of disruption | Francine Prose Yet now, except for a provision that appears intended to exempt the Syrian refugees who are Christians, and therefore of special concern to Christian Right supporters of Trump, they are to be blocked from entering the United States. This highlights the attempt to engage in religious discrimination. (Actually, if the exemption is applied as written to members of minority religions who have been most severely persecuted, the principal beneficiaries should be Yazidis from Syria and Baha'i from Iran. That may not be President Trump's intent and it may not be followed in practice.) In the period following the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States committed a number of acts that damaged the country's worldwide standing. They include the invasion of Iraq that was justified by the false claim that Saddam Hussein possessed an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction that endangered the United States; the water-boarding, wall-slamming and other abuses of detainees from many countries at CIA ""black sites""; the extremely prolonged detentions without charges or trial at Guantanamo; the poor administration of occupied Iraq that allowed the country to descend into chaos and helped to spawn terrorist movements in the region; and the torture and sexual humiliation of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. Now, by excluding all refugees from certain Muslim-majority countries and by denying all visas to nationals of those countries, President Trump is further detracting from the prestige of the United States as a country where people are treated fairly regardless of race, religion or national origin. If he thinks this will enhance safety, he is sadly mistaken. Even if he could keep out all those he thinks might threaten the United States, he will heighten the danger to many millions of Americans who live, work and travel outside its borders. America, and Americans, would be safer if the country is seen by the world to live up to the ideals represented by the Statue of Liberty.",0
1039,src_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,24/9/2015,747 words,Harriet Sherwood and Ed Pilkington,'We were once foreigners': pope attacks Trump brand of migrant demonization; Francis made no specific mention of the Republican presidential frontrunner but put xenophobia square in the crosshairs during his speech to Congress,Broadsheet,"The dominant theme of the historic address by Pope Francis to the US Congress on Thursday was certainly immigration.  In the heart of American power, the pontiff spoke of ""thousands of persons [who] are led to travel north in search of a better life"" - in North America, which has been rattled by a political war of words as thousands travel from Mexico and Central America to the US, but also with direct reference to the ongoing European migration crisis. Here to make sense of Francis's message on immigration from both sides of the Atlantic are Guardian religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood and Guardian US chief reporter Ed Pilkington. Ed Pilkington:  We expected Pope Francis to deliver strong words on immigration, but if I were Donald Trump I'd be quaking in my boots. The frontrunner Republican presidential candidate wasn't mentioned by name, of course, but he was certainly present in the passage the pontiff reserved on the subject. It was devastating. Francis got one of the biggest cheers of the speech with this line: ""We are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners."" He called on Congress to reject a ""mindset of hostility"". Then he referred to the thousands of people travelling north from Central America and Mexico to enter the US. Francis spoke not in terms of rape and murder, as Trump has chosen to do, but as epitomes of the American dream - people like so many in the US who have come here in search of a better life. ""Is this not what we want for our own children?"" is a phrase that will continue to resonate in the fevered presidential debate for some time to come. Indeed, new data shows that 47% more unaccompanied children were apprehended crossing the southern US border last month than in August of last year, at the height of the United States' own immigration crisis.  Harriet Sherwood:  And the pope referred again - as he did at the White House on Wednesday - to his own family background: ""I say this to you as the son of immigrants."" Those were practically his first public words on US soil, so his message couldn't be more clear. But I don't think it's just about the US track record on immigration. He's also talking about a global crisis: ""Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the second world war."" That's referring to the hundreds of thousands of people trudging across Europe in search of a better life. So David Cameron and the rest of the UK government should listen up, too.  Ed Pilkington:  Absolutely. And this is a message that will resonate in the US as well, where leaders of both main parties have so far been hesitant to make firm commitments about taking more Syrian refugees. We asked the presidential candidates recently what they would do to help solve the Syrian refugee crisis and were met with an almost universal evasion.  Harriet Sherwood:  Yes. Both the US and the UK have been put to shame by the response of the German government, which has opened its doors to refugees. But, in a characteristic move, Pope Francis has also called for every Catholic parish to take in a refugee family, and indeed is hosting one in the Vatican. That was a very practical action, and consistent with his papacy. It's interesting to wonder if history might have taken a different course if every Catholic parish had taken in a Jewish family in 1938.  Ed Pilkington:  I'm struck by how effortlessly Francis moved in his speech from the very practical, as you say, to evoking the finer spirit in humanity: Moses, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King. In that tradition, he called on Congress to ""avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome"". I couldn't help thinking at that point of the wall that Trump wants to build along the US border with Mexico, and his talk of mass deportation of all 11 million undocumented immigrants.  Harriet Sherwood:  Indeed. And it's really significant that he is clear that we should open our doors not just to people fleeing war and persecution, but also those who are often termed ""economic migrants"". These are people in search of greater opportunities, Francis said. ""Is this not what we want for our own children?"" And: ""Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves."" These are strong words and clear guidance from the Holy Father, and our political leaders should be shifting uncomfortably in their seats. ",0
1055,src_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,18/3/2016,900 words,Patrick Kingsley in Istanbul,"Syrian refugees still aim for Europe as leaders finalise EU-Turkey deal; Single young men disregard EU-Turkey return plan, while those with dependents think twice about hazardous journey",Broadsheet,"Youssef Frayha, a Syrian student, still wants to get to Europe. Even as EU leaders gathered in Brussels to thrash out a proposal to return asylum seekers to Turkey, Frayha was hatching his own plans to leave Turkey for Greece. First he gave away his metro pass. Then he headed for the back streets of Aksaray, the district of Istanbul where many Syrian refugees start their journeys to Greece. There the show went on. Shopkeepers kept selling their knock-off lifejackets. Refugees kept enquiring about trips to Europe.  Related: EU strikes deal with Turkey to send back refugees ""Come with me if you want a better chance of not getting caught,"" one bespectacled shopkeeper told Frayha, leading him down into a smoky basement cafe to meet a prominent local smuggler. ""We have the safest route."" This week, that was a bolder claim than usual. European and Turkish leaders finally agreed on Friday a deal that the EU hopes will see all asylum seekers returned to Turkey in exchange for (EURO)6bn (£4.7bn), more European visas for Turks, and a tiny resettlement scheme that will probably see a few thousand of the 2.7 million Syrians in Turkey flown legally to Europe. The rest will be left in poverty in Turkey where, despite new labour regulations, most Syrians still have little chance of working legally.  The move that is slated to come into force on Sunday seems likely to curb the flow as well as respect for international law. Refugees who are deported to Turkey will be sent to the back of the queue for formal resettlement, disincentivising the boat crossing.  But if Frayha is anything to go by, the deal may see the return of the migratory dynamic of last spring rather than usher in a brave new era. Back then, young men like Frayha forged new routes through Europe, paving the way for the less nimble to follow in their wake, and forcing Balkan governments to lay on special trains to transport them towards Germany. ""The trains have now stopped, yes,"" said Frayha, between appointments with different smugglers. ""But I can still get a fake passport, and pretend to be Spanish."" Even deportation back to Turkey won't stop him, Frayha promised. ""If I can't go to Greece, then of course I'll find another way,"" he said, heavy metal music blasting from his headphones. ""Probably from [the Turkish port of] Mersin to Italy. I've actually already talked to a smuggler about that route."" At Frayha's second appointment, the smuggler was despondent about the future of his business in the Aegean, but predicted that people would try other methods.  ""We will still have people going,"" said Abu Hassan, who worked for a charity before becoming a smuggler 18 months ago because of the better money on offer. ""People will keep going even if they are shot. But for sure the numbers will go down this year."" In a chilly flat on the edge of the city, a Syrian single mother explained why. Last autumn, once the countries of the Balkans made it easier for families to reach Germany, Bouchra dreamed of following in their footsteps. But the deportation deal and the closure of the Greek-Macedonian border made it far harder for vulnerable parents like Bouchra and her eight-year-old son, Hammouda, to make it to northern Europe.  ""The idea of going to Germany is still in my mind,"" said Bouchra. ""But now that they have closed the border, what choice do I have? To go back to Syria, or to go to the camps."" Bouchra's story would be instructive for the EU authorities, who justify their new deal by claiming that Turkey upholds refugee rights. When Bouchra went to enrol her son in a local state school, she was initially told to pay twice her monthly salary for the privilege. It was only three months later, when she returned with a list of 500 Syrian children out of education, that local officials agreed to grant her son a place in a new school. Despite a new Turkish labour law, which Europe says grants Syrians the right to work, Bouchra must work illegally for far below the minimum wage. The new law only gives work permits to those Syrians who have the blessing of their employers - and Bouchra's employer is not one of them. It is this kind of loophole that has forced Frayha to chance his luck this weekend in the Aegean. Since his landlord won't give him a rent contract, he can't apply for a certain kind of ID card, known as the kimlik. Without the kimlik, he has no chance of a work permit. As a result, Frayha has been left in a legal limbo that he says undermines the EU's designation of Turkey as a ""safe"" country for refugees. ""Are we safe from being shelled in Turkey?"" asked Frayha. ""Yes. But am I safe from being homeless? The government doesn't help, and I'm all alone."" Syria is not an option for Frayha: he fled his home on the coast to avoid fighting for Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, whose troops have killed and tortured hundreds of thousands of people over the past five years. So Europe, whatever the threat of deportation might be, is still Frayha's dream. And unlike Bouchra, Frayha has no dependents to make him think twice about it. ""I'm not going there to take money,"" said Frayha, who studied French before fleeing Syria. ""But I want to go somewhere where I can work legally. I'm 22 and I have the power and energy to do something about my future. So I will still try for Europe, and try to live my life.""  Additional reporting by Eiad Abdullatif ",1

The milestone, which was reached after 120 new refugees arrived in Scotland in the past week, means that Scotland has taken around one third of the total number of Syrian refugees who have arrived in the UK since last October.  The government committed last September to resettle 20,000 people from refugee camps on the Syrian border in the next five years, while Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said at the time that it would should accept 1,000 refugees ""as a starting point for a meaningful discussion"". The Scottish government's equalities secretary, Angela Constance, described the milestone as ""significant"", saying: ""It is a great credit that 29 out of 32 local authorities in Scotland have now taken Syrian refugees, in marked contrast to what is happened south of the border.""  Figures released by the Home Office in May exposed a wide disparity in the acceptance rates of councils across the country, with Scotland welcoming more Syrian refugees than any other part of the UK under the official resettlement scheme, accepting more than 600 people, compared with just 33 who were taken in by London local authorities, and none by Greater Manchester. Asked whether the Scottish government would be setting further limits on numbers, Constance said: ""It's difficult to put a limit on what is our moral duty when responding to a humanitarian crisis. Given that refugee and asylum matters remain reserved, what we have always said is that we stand ready to take our fair and proportionate share."" Constance added: ""It's important that we remember the refugee crisis is not over. I am particularly concerned about unaccompanied children, and we will continue to urge the UK government to accept more refugees.""  Related: 'I've tried to find a way to enjoy this life': Syrian refugees one year on The minister marked the milestone with a visit to The Welcoming, a drop-in project in Edinburgh that provides English language lessons to refugees, as well as assistance with CV writing and form-filling, and a ""Scotland for Newcomers"" course, which explains issues from Brexit to independence, to people of about 60 different nationalities each year. The director, John Busby, explained that members of the established Syrian community in Edinburgh had volunteered to help with particular cultural and social needs of those who had arrived in the city since the winter.

The prime minister's promise was made back in October, amid growing criticism of the government's response to the unfolding crisis in the Mediterranean. It followed an earlier announcement that the UK would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees after photographs of the body of three-year old Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach near Bodrum in Turkey - a harrowing image, which triggered a wave of public support and demands for the UK to do more to provide protection for those fleeing the conflict.  In this season of goodwill, the news that the first wave of refugees has been accommodated is to be welcomed but the sudden evolution of UK resettlement policy comes after years of foot dragging. The conflict in Syria, which started back in March 2011, has led to the deaths of around 250,000 people and displaced more than 10m, around 4.5m of whom have left the country.  Until January 2014, the government's policy was to be generous with humanitarian aid to Syria's neighbours rather than to accept refugees for resettlement. Then, under pressure from charities and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the government established a Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement (VPR) Programme to provide a route for selected Syrian refugees to come to the UK. The government committed itself to resettling ""several hundred"" Syrian refugees over a three-year period. Just 187 people were resettled in the period to June 2015.  A significant proportion of those people were resettled in Coventry, where the local response has been welcoming, supportive and inclusive, drawing on a high level of community support and committed community leadership teams.  This work has not always been easy or straightforward. Whilst the Home Office covers the direct costs associated with resettlement, it is down to local authorities to mobilise the necessary staff and local resources to find homes for families and school places for children. The fact that more than 50 local authorities have now done so is a significant achievement. But it is important to remember the scale of the crisis and how much more remains to be done.  Since the beginning of 2015 nearly 1 million people have crossed the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas in search of protection or a better life. Germany has taken in 760,000 asylum seekers this year with a third of all arrivals coming from Syria. The UK, protected from the crisis by its geographical location, will not participate in the refugee relocation schemes being developed by the EU to address the needs of those who have already arrived in Europe, arguing that this will simply encourage others to make the dangerous journey. And questions remain about what will happen once Christmas is over, when people return to their desks to find that the pressure to deliver the prime minister's vow is no longer driving the resettlement agenda. Will the efforts continue at the same pace? And will refugees be provided with the long-term support needed to rebuild their lives?  To be successful, resettlement must do more than meet immediate basic needs. One of the primary needs is to learn English which not only increases the chances of getting a job but also enables individuals to understand their rights and obligations as a citizen of a society and provides an opportunity to meet others in the community, reducing isolation. Yet across the country English language courses are being cut back due to the government's £45m cut in the Esol budget.  Refugees fleeing conflict and war have significant, and often unmet, mental health needs. Resettlement brings its own challenges: isolation from friends and family; guilt and anxiety about those left behind; poor living conditions; difficulties in accessing services; and hostility from some members of the community and sections of the British press (contrast that story with this one ). But the UK's mental health care system is in crisis and it seems unlikely that refugees will easily be able to access existing services.  Meanwhile the Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget which is being used to fund the programme can only be used to support people for their first 12 months in the UK. All of which raises important questions about how resettled refugees will get the long-term support that they need.  So as we head off to join our families and friends for a week of overindulgence, we should remember that for the Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the UK, one journey may have ended but another has only just begun. And it will last well beyond Christmas.  Ensuring that the UK meets its international obligations towards those fleeing the conflict in Syria will require more than prime ministerial pledges. We will all need to dig deep and find ways to harness the widespread public support shown over recent months to increase the scale and depth of our commitment.

1130,src_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,20/6/2014,595 words,Harriet Sherwood,Most refugees since second world war: ... but Britain takes in just 24 Syrians via scheme,Broadsheet,"Britain has allowed just 24 Syrians to move to the UK under a special relocation programme for vulnerable refugees set up by David Cameron in the face of millions of desperate people fleeing the civil war. The Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme was established in January after the UK declined to participate in a UN-administered resettlement programme. According to the most recent figures, 2.8 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began more than three years ago, with a further 6.5 million forcibly displaced inside Syria. Neighbouring countries are struggling to cope with the influx, with no sign of abatement. There are about 1.1 million UN-registered refugees in Lebanon, making up a quarter of that country's population; 760,000 in Turkey; 600,000 in Jordan, and 200,000 in Iraq. Many more are unregistered or awaiting registration. The UK scheme is intended ""to provide protection in this country to particularly vulnerable refugees who are at grave risk"" by relocating them to Britain. It is separate from the asylum application process for Syrians who are already in the UK to work or study, or manage to reach the UK independently. About 4,000 Syrians have made applications through this channel since the conflict began. Those admitted via the scheme are given five years of ""humanitarian protection"", including benefits and the possibility of family reunification. As new figures released today show the number of refugees in the world reaching levels not seen since the second world war, the UN said the international community must dramatically increase its intake of Syrians in the next two years to help relieve the burden on countries such as Lebanon and Jordan. ""We are appealing for a meaningful increase in the number of resettlement opportunities. We are asking for (an additional) 100,000 vacancies globally, and we hope that all countries will increase their quotas,"" Antonio Guterres, the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), said. The international community has pledged to resettle more than 33,000 Syrian refugees by the end of 2014. The UNHCR has set a new target of 130,000 in total by the end of 2016. Last week, Germany agreed to double the number of Syrian refugees accepted under its humanitarian admission programme to 20,000. Austria recently agreed to triple the number of refugees it would accept to 1,500. Guterres said that the UNHCR's strategy had changed in recent months, ""when it became clear the conflict would be a protracted one"", especially after the failure of the Geneva negotiations. Now it was imperative that western countries stepped up to share the refugee burden. ""We are quite optimistic that our (overall) target will be achieved, and it's possible we may be able to be more ambitious in the near future,"" said Guterres. The Home Office said: ""The vulnerable persons relocation scheme is making a real difference to the lives of some of the most vulnerable Syrians by giving them protection and support in the UK. We envisage it will support several hundred people over the next three years."" The UK had donated £600m to humanitarian relief efforts in the region, making it the largest bilateral donor after the US, the Home Office said. The Refugee Council said it was disappointed with the figures. ""The UK has so far yet to offer enough resettlement places to fill a bus when we should be offering entire planeloads of seats to safety,"" said its chief executive, Maurice Wren.

More than 100,000 events are expected to be held across the UK as part of The Great Get Together, organised by the Jo Cox Foundation. Organisers hope it will be the biggest number of community events since the Queen's diamond jubilee. Cox was stabbed and shot outside her constituency surgery in Batley and Spen, West Yorkshire, on 16 June last year by Thomas Mair. The weekend of events will take place between 16 and 18 June, with picnics, street parties and iftar, the meal eaten by Muslims to break their fast during Ramadan.  They have been organised in conjunction with The Big Lunch, an annual event that aims to combat loneliness with communal meals and activities.  In Leeds, a group of Syrian refugees will host an iftar at a local church and provide free meals to homeless people. Other events include a teddy bears' picnic in Hartlepool, a scarecrow festival in Ilkley and a medieval lunch in Coventry.  A street party will also take place in Cox's former constituency. It is hoped that a party in London's Olympic Park will attract up to 10,000 participants. Brendan Cox, the widower of the murdered MP, said he was ""amazed and humbled"" by the numbers who had responded to calls to mark the anniversary. ""I think the huge response is because we're tapping into the national mood,"" he said.  ""A desire for unity and togetherness rather than the divisiveness of politics and the public debate in recent years.

Now others must help; As my country hosts the first humanitarian summit, we look to global leaders to follow our example on the refugee crisis",Broadsheet,"Today the first world humanitarian summit opens in Istanbul, bringing together heads of state, prime ministers and cabinet members from more than 100 countries and reflecting the United Nations' appreciation that Turkey currently hosts more refugees than any other country. But the extent to which the international humanitarian aid system lies broken is alarming.  Related: Erdogan calls on Europe to take in more Syrian refugees Nearly 60 million people depend on humanitarian aid to survive. According to the UN's high commissioner for refugees, the number of refugees and displaced persons has reached its highest level since the second world war. Almost half are children. The existing humanitarian aid system depends heavily on the UN and remains at the mercy of individual nation states. This is a global problem and must be addressed to cater to the needs of millions of people affected by wars, conflicts and natural disasters every year. Violent conflicts claim lives in Syria, Libya and Yemen every day, while ethnic tensions and natural disasters haunt numerous countries in Asia and Africa. Haunting images of refugees flocking to border gates, the dead bodies of innocent children on beaches and people living in extreme poverty symbolise the tragedy of everyday life in many places. The summit will address these pressing problems, seek to fix the humanitarian system's glitches and make a long-term commitment to develop new capabilities. For the first time, heads of state and government, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and those affected by humanitarian crises will come together to look for answers. Turkey has been a safe haven for people escaping war, destruction and oppression for centuries, and today we provide humanitarian relief in more than 140 countries on five continents. In fact, Turkey remains the world's most generous country, spending a bigger share of its GDP on humanitarian aid than any other.  Related: Children fleeing conflict deserve more than razor wire and border fences | Carsten Völz and Andreas Papp What sets Turkey apart is our commitment to making an actual difference on the ground and changing people's lives - instead of pursuing hidden agendas, drawing up fancy charts or treating people in need in a condescending way. When I visited Somalia in August 2011, I found a country on which the world had turned its back. What many considered to be a failed state overwhelmed by drought, famine and conflict, Somalia was in ruins. At the time, Turkey made a commitment to help the people of Somalia get back on their feet - a mission Turkish aid agencies, in cooperation with their local partners, accomplished in five years. Today, the incredible progress that Somalia has made to promote political stability, combat terrorism and make its citizens safer has not only inspired the entire region but also gives us the strength to help others. Turkey's response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria is another success story. Having adopted an open-door policy towards Syrian refugees in 2011, we now host nearly 3 million Syrian nationals from diverse ethnic, religious and sectarian backgrounds. In the past five years Turkey has allocated $10bn to provide Syrian refugees with free healthcare, education and housing. At a time when the international community failed the Syrian people - 600,000 of whom have lost their lives in the civil war, with 13 million forced from their homes - Turkey, along with the rest of Syria's neighbours, was left to deal with the conflict's consequences. As the Syrian civil war enters its sixth year, we are calling on the world to create a fair mechanism for sharing the burden.  Related: Europe's failure on refugees echoes the moral collapse of the 1930s The international community in particular has largely ignored its responsibilities toward the Syrian people by turning a blind eye to Bashar al-Assad's crimes against his own citizens. It was not until refugees appeared in the streets of Europe and terrorist organisations such as Islamic State started attacking EU citizens that European leaders realised they could no longer ignore the problem. Many Syria-related problems could have been avoided had the world intervened in the early stages of the conflict. But it's not too late if European leaders are ready to make the right commitments today. To keep illegal immigration under control Europe and Turkey must work together to create legal mechanisms, such as the March 2016 agreement, for the resettlement of Syrian refugees. By rewarding refugees who play by the rules and making it clear that illegal immigrants will be sent back to Turkey, we can persuade refugees to avoid risking their lives at sea. The international community must not buy into Assad's argument that his removal from power will further escalate the conflict in Syria. To give Syria's democracy a chance to flourish, we must commit to defeating both Isis and the Assad regime, instead of looking for the lesser evil. As a key stakeholder in the Middle East, the EU must work more effectively with Turkey and others to develop a lasting solution. Make no mistake: the Syrian people will continue to suffer until the international community makes a serious effort to end the crisis, prevent attacks against civilians and enforce terror-free safe zones in the country. And the UN security council must lead the way. We urge the permanent members to use their veto power to promote peace, stability and security around the world instead of looking out for their short-term interests. Global leaders will this week make concrete commitments to reform the system, but whether the summit can make an actual difference depends on the sincerity of participants and how much room there is in our hearts for 125 million fellow human beings. Together we must restore hope in the hearts of the poor, the hungry and the oppressed. Let us join together to take a giant leap forward toward a more peaceful, safe and fair world.",1

""Even this is better than aerial bombardments,"" says former Idlib taxi driver Abdulhamid Daher, 57. He sits behind the national stadium, Stade du 26 Mars, in Bamako. A friend from the same city in north-west Syria has a job guarding a lorry parked on the wasteland. Daher spends his days here drinking tea, except Mondays. That is when he goes to the German embassy to ask when he might be able to join his wife and seven children in Dortmund. The routine has been the same for seven months. Reports from northern Mali indicate that hundreds of people - perhaps up to 2,000 - have migrated from Syria since October. But the figures are unconfirmed. No one keeps records at In-Khalil - a border post in the desert between Mali and Algeria.  The picture is clearer in Bamako. Last month, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) confirmed that it has registered 92 Syrians in Mali's capital. All but 10 of them have been granted refugee status. Most, like Daher, want to join relatives in Europe.  ""We were separated by the war. When the bombing started I sent my wife and small children to another neighbourhood of Idlib. One of my sons had a job on a building site in Libya. He was able to get them out, and to get them to Italy then Germany. I got out later.""  So far, Daher's journey has covered nearly 7,000km. From Syria, he fled to Turkey - ""The Mediterranean was too frightening."" He spent five months in Mauritania's capital, Nouakchott, before travelling to Mali.  ""I came to Bamako because there are other Syrians here and the Malians have a good reputation. The people here do not speak Arabic. But they are kind. We never go hungry. Our biggest problem is the filth and the mosquitoes that give us malaria,'' says Daher, a diabetic who receives treatment at a state hospital. Mali, one of the poorest countries in the world, is better-known for its large-scale emigration - thousands of young men cross the Sahara every year en route to Europe - than for hosting refugees. Since 2012, it has been under attack by groups linked to al-Qaida. France intervened militarily in 2013. Currently, 12,600 UN military and police are deployed in the country, which has thousands of displaced citizens and high levels of poverty and malnutrition. Seven Syrian families live in a three-room flat near the stadium. It has no furniture - only mattresses and mosquito nets. The families came to the neighbourhood because 35-year-old Jamal Ahmad guards the lorry here. ""I arrived in west Africa before the war, five years ago. I was recruited by a Lebanese guy to drive a truck in Burkina Faso. But that did not work out so I came to Mali. My wife and our six children joined me two years ago. I earn 100,000 CFA francs ($200) per month.  ""Everything else is charity. A Mauritanian man is paying the school fees of all our children. The Malian who owns the truck has given us use of the flat. Some Lebanese Malians pay our water and electricity bills. But the conditions are terrible. There are open sewers everywhere.""  Ahmad, who was a lorry driver in Syria, says most of the refugees want to go to Germany or Sweden. ""But the paperwork is slow. We feel helpless. We have contacted different international charities but only one, Acted, has given us a little cash.""  The Syrians include about 20 Kurds from Kobani who live in a different part of Bamako. Mechanic Antar Khalil, 45, arrived 16 months ago with his wife and five children. He wants to go to Sweden, Switzerland or Canada but has high praise for Mali. ""There was no work for foreigners in Mauritania. Here you can manage if you are willing to do any job. The Malians pay anything from 5,000 francs to 20,000 per day. They do their best for us.""  Malians have a good reputation. The people here do not speak Arabic. But they are kind. We never go hungry. In the past few months, the UNHCR has provided mosquito nets, mattresses, kitchen sets and cash grants. The agency presses the government to register the Syrians as refugees and raises awareness of their existence with the embassies of the countries they wish to go to.  As the months pass, the risk grows that some will attempt to follow the perilous route across the desert to Algeria or Libya. The UNHCR warns them of the dangers but it cannot stop them. For reasons of security and resources, the agency has no staff in the far north of Mali. In September, a group of 36 Syrians were arrested in Gao. When the UNHCR went to the police station two days after their arrest, the group had left - possibly to cross the desert with traffickers. The whereabouts of the up to 2,000 Syrians reported at In-Khalil is unknown.  ""The Syrians are living in hardship but there is a limit to what we can do,"" said a UNHCR official in Bamako. ""We need to provide protection without discrimination. There are 15,000 Mauritanians in Kayes [western Mali]. We also have Ivorian and Congolese refugees. Last year, unexpectedly, we received 1,000 refugees from the Central African Republic.""  The UN's regional humanitarian coordinator for the Sahel, Toby Lanzer, said he was aware of the Syrians in Mali. ""Getting stuck in Mali is far from what any refugee from Syria might hope for. But aid agencies have received less than 15% of the funding they applied for [under the 2016 humanitarian response plan ] for their operations on behalf of the people of Mali. If resources are unavailable, stark choices have to be made.""",1

Related: Fact check: was Peter Dutton right about 'illiterate' refugees 'taking jobs'? The attitude is in stark contrast to government statements this week. Immigration minister Peter Dutton argued refugees are largely uneducated and illiterate, and that accepting more into Australia would see them take jobs from Australians or burden the country's welfare system. But more than half of Australian respondents to the Amnesty survey said they would welcome refugees into their neighbourhoods, and more than one in 10 would welcome a refugee to live in their home. Globally, China, Germany and the UK were found to be the countries with populations most welcoming of refugees, followed by Canada and Australia in fifth place; while Russia, Indonesia and Thailand ranked lowest of the 27 countries surveyed. Some 27,000 people responded to the survey, conducted by Globescan in person, by phone, and online, for Amnesty International. The survey of Australians found: 84% agreed that ""people should be able to take refuge in other countries to escape war or persecution"". 71% believed the government should do more to help refugees fleeing war or persecution. 68% would welcome refugees living in their city, town, or village. 57% would welcome refugees living in their neighbourhood. 13% would welcome refugees living in their own home. The results of the Amnesty survey contrast sharply with domestic polling, which shows support for hardline asylum policies in Australia. Essential Report polling found 48% of people (43% of Labor voters, 62% of Coalition voters) oppose the idea of bringing asylum seekers from Manus Island to Australia, even though Papua New Guinea's supreme court has found the centre illegal. Of 27,000 respondents globally, two-thirds said their governments should do more to help refugees. One in 10 would accept a refugee to live in their own home.  In China, 46% said they would accept refugees into their own home. In Germany, which received 1.1 million asylum seekers in 2015, almost every respondent (96%) said they would accept refugees in their country, while only 3% said refugees should be refused entry. In Jordan - a country that already hosts 650,000 Syrian refugees - 84% of people believe their government should do more to assist refugees fleeing war or persecution. Refugees from Syria make up a quarter of Lebanon's population and 69% of that country's citizens believe their government should do more to assist. ""These figures speak for themselves,"" Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty said. ""People are ready to make refugees welcome, but governments' inhumane responses to the refugee crisis are badly out of touch with their own citizens. ""The Refugees Welcome Index exposes the shameful way governments have played short-term politics with the lives of people fleeing war and repression. ""Governments cannot allow their response to the refugee crisis to be held hostage by headlines. Too often they use xenophobic anti-refugee rhetoric to chase approval ratings. This survey suggests they are not listening to the silent majority of welcoming citizens who take the refugee crisis personally."" This week Dutton said Australia would not consider accepting more refugees than its current humanitarian intake, presently at 13,750 rising to 18,750 by 2018. A one-off additional intake of 12,000 Syrian refugees is currently being undertaken.  Dutton said more refugees would be a drain on Australia's welfare system, or else would cause unemployment to rise by taking jobs from Australians. ""For many people, they won't be, you know, numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English. These people would be taking Australian jobs, there's no question about that,"" Dutton said. ""For many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in unemployment queues and on Medicare and the rest of it, so there would be huge cost and there's no sense in sugar-coating that, that's the scenario.""  Amnesty International Australia's refugee co-ordinator Graham Thom said that while Australia had experienced ""dreadful rhetoric"" around boat-borne asylum seekers for years, criticism of Australia's offshore humanitarian program to resettle recognised refugees from overseas - in defiance of international opinion - was rare. ""I think that disconnect between the attitudes of ordinary Australians and the political rhetoric in this country was most apparent in the response to the decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees,"" Thom said. ""The outpouring of generosity from churches, community groups, individual families offering their homes to assist people demonstrated that people in Australia are ready and willing to assist people in need."" Thom said wealthy Western countries needed to do more to help resettle displaced people across the world. Currently 86% of the world's refugees are hosted by developing countries. National leaders and delegates will meet at the UN-convened world humanitarian summit in Istanbul next week, where countries are expected to make commitments to resettle more refugees.",1

A lot of people in Europe think that we refugees don't know that we can die at sea, that we have not seen the horrific pictures of refugees' dead bodies, that we don't know that tens of thousands of people have been buried on Europe's shores.  Related: Migrant crisis: smuggling or trafficking? Politicians don't seem to know | But I do watch the news every day, and I had seen how more than 500 people had died a few kilometres from the Italian island Lampedusa in October 2013. I knew the statistics, I knew the risks. I had even lost friends of mine, who are some of the ""refugees without a face and without a name"", as the media refers to them. But, in the same way as many Syrian refugees who, together with Eritreans, made up about half of the refugees crossing over to Europe by boat in 2014, I thought this was my only chance.  I am a Syrian refugee from the Palestinian al-Yarmouk camp in Damascus. When I was small, my grandmother used to tell us how she felt when she was forced to flee to Syria from her home in Palestine in 1948, and how she hoped that her children and grandchildren would never have to experience what it feels like to be a refugee. But we did. I was born a Palestinian refugee, and almost three years ago I became a refugee once more, when my family and I had to flee the Syrian war to Lebanon. Our home, the Palestinian camp, had been under the hardest siege one can possibly imagine. I am still in touch with family and friends who could not leave Yarmouk camp. In a cruel absurdity, they sometimes have internet, but they don't have food. Many of them have starved to death or died because they do not have access to medication or treatment. Many of the refugees left in Yarmouk have starved to death or died because they do not have access to medication My friends and family have always known me as a very optimistic person. I love life, I love people. I had worked in Cyprus, and even when I could not return home to my beloved Syria because the war had already started, giving up was the last thing I had in mind. In Lebanon, I started supporting my fellow Syrians and Palestinian-Syrians. They needed me, and their smiles and appreciation kept me going. I woke up every morning to volunteer with DPNA (Development for People and Nature Association), a partner organisation of CARE. But about a year ago, I could not bear the situation any more. I felt the refugees' suffering - that of the Syrians, the Palestinians, the Syrian-Palestinians. I felt their misery, their destroyed hopes and dreams. And I also thought about my own life, my future. I had lost hope. Before the war in Syria started, I had my whole life ahead of me. But then, at 27, my life as it was suddenly took a break. I could not work legally in my profession as an engineer any more. I had studied, I had money, a good job. Suddenly, I stood there with nothing at all. Being a refugee also means losing your future, your dreams.  I did not get on the boat to go to Europe. After long discussions with my family and friends, I am still in Lebanon, and I am still supporting my fellow refugees. I am leading a project to train other volunteers now. Refugees are in need of humanitarian support. The refugees I work with have been engineers like me; they were doctors, teachers, farmers and workers. We had normal lives, and, as much as we refugees appreciate Europe for what it is, it's not ""heaven on earth"" for us.  Related: Syrian refugees: 'A whole generation is growing up displaced and uneducated' | Patricia Mouamar Like me, most refugees dream about going back home, going back to Syria. But if peace is not restored and neighbouring countries continue to struggle with the burden of hosting 4 million Syrian refugees, Europe for some seems to be the only option to live a life in dignity. We humans are all quite similar: we love our friends, our families, our home. We do not give this up easily. But bombs and bullets keep us away from the place we love most. I follow the news, I follow the discussions. I hear politicians talk about the necessity for the EU to resume its rescue missions; about issuing asylum to Syrians and other refugees before they have to travel on unsafe waters. I am truly touched that so many people around the world cry out about our suffering, that people around the world care. They understand that I have not chosen to be born as a Palestinian Syrian, as you have not chosen to be born as a European. I do not wish my situation on anyone. But I would hope that we could make this time in history a time of change. Europeans have gone through similar pain, just a few generations ago. Europeans too have been refugees ; they were the reason why grand international law projects like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1951 refugee convention were drafted in the first place. I really hope that people in Europe can remind themselves of the bond of humanity that connects us all and that remains the strongest medicine against desperation and powerlessness. But more than anything I hope that European and other leaders around the world resume their efforts to push for peace talks. In the end, most refugees hope that they can cease to be called refugees, that their countries will restore peace and that they can return to the places they love most: their homes.

(I'll come back to that groupist description in a moment).  The Sun's leading article a week ago (17 November) began: ""Here is a simple way for Muslims to denounce the monsters of IS: march through London in massive numbers with placards saying 'not in our name.'"" It argued that Muslims had ""done too little in public to express solidarity with the victims in Paris and the civilised, tolerant democracies in which they live and which IS want to destroy."" A day later, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) took out an advert in the national press, backed by 300 affiliate organisations, which ""unreservedly"" condemned the Paris attacks. The MCB's secretary general, Dr Shuja Shafi, said it was ""important that our fellow Britons hear this message loudly and clearly"". But some fellow Britons, including politicians and journalists, did not seem to get the message. They demanded yet greater public instances of Isis being rejected by Muslims living in Britain.  And a similar deaf ear to widespread rejection of Isis - this New York Times round-up is a fine example - has been evident also in the United States, where the issue is being debated through the prism of the arrival of Syrian refugees.  Two Republican presidential candidates - Donald Trump and Ben Carson - have been particularly vocal. Trump has suggested American Muslims should be registered by their faith. Carson likened Syrian refugees to ""rabid dogs"". But should Muslims - there's that groupist designation again - really have to apologise for Isis by making a great show of it? Dalia Mogahed, research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding in Washington, an organisation that seeks to amplify the voices of American Muslims, has answered that question with a cogent ""no"".  During an interview on MSNBC, she was asked whether more Muslim leaders should speak out against Isis. Here's her reply:  ""I think we should take a step back and ask a different question, which is: 'Is it justified to demand that Muslims condemn terrorism?' Now that might sound a little radical even asking it. The reason I say that is this. Condoning the killing of civilians is, to me, about the most monstrous thing you can to do. And to be suspected of doing something so monstrous, simply because of your faith, seems very unfair. Now when you look at the majority of terrorist attacks in the United States, according to the FBI, the majority of domestic terror attacks are actually committed by white, male Christians. Now that's just the facts. When those things occur, we don't suspect other people who share their faith and ethnicity of condoning them. We assume that these things outrage them just as much as they do anyone else. And we have to afford this same assumption of innocence to Muslims.  This strikes me as a brilliant rebuttal of the demand that Muslims should be required to speak out. Of course, there are other ways of making the argument.  Take this tweet by someone called Kash Ali ( as reported on Vox ):  ""I don't understand why non Muslims think we British Muslims can stop Isis, mate I can't even get a text back from the girl I like and you expect me to stop a terrorist organization ffs.""  But let me come back to the constant references in so many newspaper headlines and editorials to ""Muslims"" and my contention that this is, for want of a better term, groupism or group think. Muslims do not form a united, homogenous entity. We would never think of referring to Christians in a similar way because we are aware that the catch-all description is virtually meaningless.  What's more, is it not blindingly obvious that it smacks of bigotry to blame an entire group of people numbering in their multi-millions for the actions of a misguided minority who falsely claim some kind of religious purity? British newspapers calling for a special response from Muslims also seem to overlook the fact that more Muslims have died at the hands of Isis than non-Muslims.  The Sun, also under attack for its flawed poll alleging that one in five British Mulsims sympathise with jihadis, is in real danger of inciting anti-Muslim sentiment. It is not too late for it to stop and think about the consequences of its editorial line.",0

That pledge to recommit to the UN was ""enthusiastically"" welcomed by the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, who was in Ottawa for an official visit with Trudeau on Thursday.  ""Since the United Nations was founded, Canada has always been one of our most important partners,"" Ban said following a meeting on Parliament Hill with the prime minister.  The decision by the Trudeau government to renew the country's involvement with the UN also includes a pledge for greater participation in UN peacekeeping operations and to boost contributions on mediation, conflict prevention, and post-conflict reconstruction efforts.  But looking towards a seat on the security council will be a symbolic move away from the previous Conservative government's prickly relationship with the UN after Canada lost out to Portugal in its bid for a security council place.  The snub was widely seen as a rebuke from the global community over a number of unpopular foreign policy stances taken by the former Conservative government under the then prime minister Stephen Harper, including a steadfast support for Israel and decreased aid to Africa.  Trudeau said Thursday he ""highlighted to the secretary general that part of Canada wishing to re-engage robustly with the United Nations and in multilateral engagement around the world includes looking towards a bid for the UN security council"" as vacancies open up.  During their meeting, the two leaders discussed Canada's ambitions to meet emissions targets set during the Paris climate talks late last year, as well as the ongoing conflict in Syria and the refugee crisis it has caused in the region.   Related: Canada 'is making history' with airlift of Syrian refugees, says minister The secretary general praised Canada's role in the Paris talks and the Liberal government's commitment to welcoming 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of February, and urged Trudeau to increase the amount the country spends on development aid.  ""I believe that Canada has capacity and resources,"" he said.  But the UN chief had little to say with regards to a controversial arms deal between Canada and Saudi Arabia when asked whether he had concerns about the multibillion deal and if he had discussed it with Trudeau, who took power in November.  Last week, Britain came under renewed pressure to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia over concerns the country was involved in indiscriminate bombing of civilians in the conflict in Yemen, following a speech by the secretary general in London urging UN permanent security council members to do more to halt the influx of weapons to the region.  ""We need states that are party to the Arms Trade Treaty to set an example in fulfilling one of the treaty's main purposes: controlling arms flows to actors that may use them in ways that breach international humanitarian law,"" Ban said in a speech in London.  Trudeau has pledged that Canada will sign on to the arms treaty.  The Liberal government has been criticised for refusing to suspend a multibillion-dollar, 14-year deal with Saudi Arabia that was brokered in 2014 the under the former Conservative government by the Canadian Commercial Corporation, a federal Crown corporation that acts as the country's international contracting and procurement agency.  Opponents of the deal, including Amnesty International, are calling for the deal to sell light armoured vehicles to Saudi security forces, manufactured by Ontario-based General Dynamics, to be suspended over concerns about the Gulf nation's human rights record.  Asked about concerns, Ban spoke broadly about the need for political, not military solutions to conflicts in the region.  ""What we see in the region like Syria and some conflict zones in Africa, there's a constant flow of arms to either side, government side or opposition side,"" he said.  ""United Nations has been making quite clear that all these conflicts should be resolved through peaceful means, through engaging the parties, all the parties in inclusive dialogue."" On Thursday evening, Trudeau will host an official dinner with Ban and his wife, Ban Soon-taek, in Ottawa.  On Friday, the secretary general will be in Montreal where he will meet with the Quebec premier, Philippe Couillard, and visit an anti-radicalisation centre based in the city. ",0

The 82,000 rise in overall net migration in the 12 months to June was fuelled by a rise of 62,000 in immigration to 636,000 and a fall of 30,000 in emigration compared with the previous year. The net migration figure is the highest on record for the second quarter running, and is 10,000 higher than the previous recorded peak in 2005 shortly after the former communist states of Poland, Czech Republic and others joined the EU. The latest figures confirm that Britain is firmly in an era of mass migration and the government's hopes of reducing net migration to the ""tens of thousands"" is as far away as ever. The pledge to reduce net migration below 100,000 was renewed by David Cameron shortly after the election in May. Net migration last dipped below the 100,000 mark in 1997 - 18 years ago. Home Office ministers blamed ""too many British employers still overly reliant on foreign workers"", but British business leaders rejected the charge and highlighted their commitment to training British workers as well. Meanwhile, Home Office figures show that 162 Syrian refugees have arrived under the government's vulnerable persons relocation scheme in the 12 months to September, bringing the total under the scheme to 252.  Only 36 Syrian refugees arrived under the scheme between July and September during the height of the Mediterranean refugee crisis. On 7 September Cameron announced the intention to bring 20,000 Syrians to Britain under the scheme in the next four years.  There were 29,024 asylum applications in the 12 months to September, a rise of 18%. The largest numbers applying were from Eritrea, Sudan and Iran, and 2,402 were from Syria.  Related: David Cameron reiterates commitment to cutting net migration The rise in net migration was split between an increase of 42,000 from within the EU and a rise of 36,000 in non-EU net migration. There was a 53,000 rise in the number of people coming to work in Britain, with two-thirds having a definite job to go to. The latest employment figures show that in September there were two million EU nationals (excluding UK citizens) living in Britain, 324,000 more than the previous year. The numbers coming to study have remained relatively stable at 192,000. The net migration figure of 336,000 for the 12 months to June 2015 is 3,000 higher than the 330,000 estimate for the 12 months to March 2015. The ONS said the figure for the quarter to March has been revised upwards to 336,000, giving a record level of net migration for the past two quarters. The chancellor's autumn statement on Britain's finances was based on an annual net migration figure of 183,000 a year. The latest figures suggest this may be a significant underestimate, as will be the contribution of migration to economic growth. Chai Patel, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ""Yet again David Cameron has failed to deliver on his 'no ifs, no buts' pledge to drive net migration down to the tens of thousands. One can't help but think that some in his government are quietly cheering this failure as there can be no doubt that success in driving down migration would shatter George Osborne's fragile economic recovery. The vast majority of people who are coming to the UK are here to work and are vital to our economic growth, and make a net contribution to our public services."" The immigration minister, James Brokenshire, blamed the record figures on too few overseas students leaving at the end of their courses and ""too many British employers still overly reliant on foreign workers"". Brokenshire said in the past it had been too easy for British companies to bring in overseas workers. The government was now determined to invest in training many more young Britons and had commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee to advise on making significant cuts in economic migration from outside the EU.  Simon Walker, the director general of the Institute of Directors, said companies hired staff from overseas ""because they are the right people for the job, because they fill gaping skills shortages, and because they build international links. Yet firms that hire from abroad are accused of undercutting wages and not doing enough to train young Britons. But this couldn't be further from the truth.""",1

Instead of devising a strategy to protect those fleeing the barbarity of Assad, Islamic State (Isis) and the Russian air force, EU leaders are obsessed with devising a system to ""stem the flow"" - in other words to push desperate refugees back into the Aegean sea. At the EU-Turkey summit on Monday, the Turkish prime minister, Ahmed Davutoglu, offered European leaders the illusory ""quick fix'' they sought, in return for a number of concessions. The basic principle of the "" one in, one out "" deal on offer is that any economic migrant or Syrian refugee trafficked to a Greek island will be forcibly returned to Turkey. For every Syrian sent back to Turkey from Greece, another Syrian would be accepted by EU countries and distributed under a quota scheme. It seems that both the EU and Ankara are willing to take the bait and a deal may be concluded next week, but Europe's leaders should be careful what they wish for.  Related: EU-Turkey deal could see Syrian refugees back in war zones, says UN There are a number of reasons why this approach is not just immoral, but fundamentally flawed. First, compulsory mass expulsions are, quite rightly, outlawed by the 1951 UN convention on refugees. This treaty has been signed and promoted by the EU. Article 19 of the EU's own charter of fundamental rights specifically states that ""collective expulsions are forbidden"". The UN has already made it clear that mass returns would not be consistent with international law. We know Turkey has an appalling human rights record and a non-functioning asylum system. There is even evidence that Turkey has been forcibly expelling Syrian refugees back into Syria. Does Europe really want to be responsible for an expansion of this? Given that we are simultaneously paying Turkey money to stop the flow from Turkey to Greece, one can only conclude that EU leaders are now deliberately attempting to construct a system to ensure that Europe doesn't have to take any more refugees despite our international obligations, including under the Geneva conventions, to do so. This is deeply wrong. Other parts of the draft agreement with Turkey offer a number of concessions, including more money, accelerated accession talks and a visa waiver from June. These are also hugely problematic, given the deteriorating human rights situation in Turkey and its government's brutal clampdown on the free press. Just last week, we saw the appalling occupation of Turkey's largest independent newspaper, Zaman. The EU's priority should be to bring Turkey back from the verge of becoming an authoritarian regime and using the EU accession process, to which it is party, to cement human rights values and good governance. Instead, by offering visa-free travel across Europe's crumbling Schengen zone, we will be complicit in handing Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan a domestic political victory. Any agreement must include enforceable commitments from it to reverse its crackdown on media freedom and civil liberties. Instead of trying to outsource our problems by signing up to a dodgy deal with Turkey, we should be working together to take matters into our own hands, by delivering three immediate actions. The first action we should take is to fast-track the establishment of a well-funded and well-resourced European border and coastguard service, capable of managing the European Union's external border and processing asylum claims, instead of relying on Turkey to do this for us. Instead of trying to outsource our problems, we should be working together to take matters into our own hands Second, instead of giving Turkey billions of euros, this money should be given directly to the UNHCR, to provide education facilities and a humane existence to people stuck in the refugee camps. And we should be working much harder as a bloc to provide a political solution to the Syrian conflict and doing more to contain Russian military aggression, by agreeing enhanced EU sanctions against Moscow. The European Union is a community of nations which, despite being ravaged by two world wars and divided by the cold war, managed to come together to deliver peace, security and prosperity for a generation. Despite its failings, the EU has broadly succeeded in these aims. One of the reasons for this is that the EU has never just been one giant internal market, as British prime minister David Cameron and many others would like it to become. It has been, and must continue to be, a community of nations where fundamental human rights are safeguarded and furthered. As much as it is a free trade area, it is a community of values. We are mistaken if we think that Turkey can take away our problems or the refugee crisis; it cannot. Only a genuine European approach, based on solidarity and humanity can do this. Signing up to this cynical deal with Turkey will mean tearing up the very legal order Europe built from the rubble of the second world war. Drinking from Erdogan's poisoned chalice is not the solution.",1

Few had clear answers; The Guardian pressed every contender for the White House on how they would confront shocking realities from abroad. In the midst of a campaign charged by immigration, just two called for taking on more refugees",Broadsheet,"It was an image that shocked the conscience of the world: the lifeless body of a Syrian toddler, washed ashore on a Turkish beach.   Related: UN agencies 'broke and failing' in face of ever-growing refugee crisis The drowning of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi has become emblematic of the refugee crisis and the plight of the hundreds of thousands of people who have loaded into boats just this year to risk the dangerous journey to Europe, seeking primarily to escape conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. As Europe struggles to host the millions of refugees who have fled war-torn Syria in particular, the image of Kurdi has posed a fundamental question to America: should the US open its borders to more? Last week, the Guardian contacted the campaigns of every candidate for the White House - 17 Republicans and five Democrats - to ask two questions. Should the US be accepting more refugees? And, as president, how would each candidate define US policy toward those seeking asylum from war-torn and impoverished countries? But even as presidential candidates offer foreign policy pitches through a lens of moral leadership, just one of 22 contenders - former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley - said unequivocally that the US should take in more refugees and put forward a specific number. In a statement issued on Thursday, the Democrat called on the government to accept 65,000 refugees from Syria over the next year. We - the nation of immigrants and refugees - can do more  Martin O'Malley  ""If Germany - a country with one-fourth our population - can accept 800,000 refugees this year, certainly we - the nation of immigrants and refugees - can do more,"" O'Malley said in a statement. Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican, suggested on Sunday that no additional refugees should be taken in until the US contends with the threat posed by the Islamic State.  ""What we should be doing is dealing with Isis. Until we start dealing directly with Isis, we're avoiding the core of the problem,"" Walker said in response to a question by the Guardian during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. ""The problem is that Isis is running amok in these parts of the world. The United States needs to step up and deal with it."" Ohio governor John Kasich, another Republican candidate for president, took a different view earlier on Sunday by acknowleding that the US bore some of the responsibility for accepting refugees. But the responsibility, he added, ""fundamentally falls on Europe"". ""I think we do have a responsibility in terms of taking some more folks in, making sure they assimilate, and at the same time helping people to actually be safe as they move,"" Kasich said in an appearance on ABC. ""That's logistical support."" Several campaigns, including those of top contenders such as Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and her closest challenger, Bernie Sanders, and Republicans Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the specific question of whether the US should accept more refugees. A spokeswoman for Clinton pointed to a Friday interview in which Clinton addressed the crisis more broadly, calling it ""heartbreaking"" while urging more action across the globe to alleviate the flow of refugees into Europe. ""I think that the larger Middle East, I think Asia - I think everybody should step up and say we have to help these people,"" the former secretary of state told MSNBC. ""And I would hope that under the aegis of the United Nations, led by the security council, and certainly by the United States, which has been such a generous nation in the past... we would begin to try to find ways to help people get to safety in other lands. However, that does not solve the problem, and the problem is one that, the entire world now sees, doesn't just affect the Syrian people - it affects all of us."" Rubio's campaign had declined to comment for this article, but the Florida senator said he would be ""open"" to more refugees when asked directly in an interview with Boston Herald radio on Monday.  ""We've always been a country that's been willing to accept people who have been displaced,"" Rubio said. ""I would be open to that if it can done in a way that allows us to ensure that among them are not infiltrated - people who were, you know, part of a terrorist organisation that are using this crisis."" He added that the ""vast and overwhelmingly majority"" of refugees are not terrorists, but the US must nonetheless remain cautious in its approach. Rubio also said he was concerned about displaced Syrian Christians and called for a way to ""provide for their short term"" while putting in place a strategy that would allow for them to eventually return home.  Republicans, including Rubio, have largely placed the blame on the Obama administration, citing the president's reluctance to take more definitive action against Bashar al-Assad's regime. Louisiana's governor, Bobby Jindal, also pinned the issue on what he called a ""leading from behind"" strategy on Obama's part. In a statement to the Guardian, the Republican also expressly ruled out taking in more refugees, which he said would be a ""ridiculous"" approach to resolving the crisis. ""Let's call this Syrian disaster exactly what it is - the result of President Obama's leading from behind strategy - he drew the red line and then backed down,"" Jindal said. No other country provides anywhere near the amount of assistance for hurting people around the world as we do  Bobby Jindal  ""And no, the answer is not for America to increase the number of refugees we take in. We are already the most compassionate and generous country in the world and it is not even close."" ""No other country provides anywhere near the amount of assistance for hurting people around the world as we do. But the idea that we can fix all these problems by just accepting the world's refugees is ridiculous. We simply have to get a new commander in chief, fast."" The refugee crisis is as politically charged as issues come during a presidential election in which immigration and national security have emerged as flashpoints - and in which Donald Trump has uncovered the toxicity among Republicans of how to deal with the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.  But even Trump, the GOP frontrunner who has positioned himself as the face of the conservative movement against illegal immigration, said the US should ""possibly"" accept more refugees. ""The answer is possibly yes, possibly yes,"" Trump told MSNBC last week. ""So horrible on a humanitarian basis when you see that. It's incredible what's going on.""  He added, nonetheless, that the US has no shortage of its own problems - particularly at the border. ""It is a huge problem and we should help as much as possible, but we do have to fix our own country,"" Trump said. Other Republicans have raised national security concerns over opening up the US to more refugees. On Sunday, Carly Fiorina said the US cannot relax its criteria for letting refugees in and warned against those who might be affiliated with terrorist activity. ""The United States, I believe, has done its fair share in terms of humanitarian aid,"" the former Hewlett Packard CEO said on CBS's Face the Nation. ""We are having to be very careful about who we let enter this country from these war-torn regions to ensure that terrorists are not coming here."" The Kentucky senator Rand Paul sounded similar alarms, citing the US government's acceptance of refugees from Iraq and Somalia - some of whom he said now wished to harm the country. I don't think it's a good idea to develop populations within the US who don't like the US, so we have to be selective  Rand Paul  ""We are a welcoming nation, and we have accepted a lot of refugees, and I think we will continue to do so. But we also can't accept the whole world, so I think there are some limits,"" Paul told CNN. The US has accepted only 1,500 Syrian refugees so far, and the White House said last week it did not anticipate any changes to its current policy. The secretary of state, John Kerry ,acknowledged that ""a lot more"" could be done to protect the stream of refugees, but said American efforts would remain focused on helping existing refugee camps in other nations.  ""I'm not talking about taking [in refugees] on a permanent basis,"" Kerry told the Huffington Post. ""We have huge refugee camps in Jordan, in Lebanon. They're spread more in the population. ""In Turkey, we have refugee camps. It may be that we have to set up some sort of refugee camp structure for the time being in order to deal with it."" On Sunday the former British foreign secretary David Miliband, who is now based in New York as head of the International Rescue Committee, called on the US to bring out ""the kind of leadership America has shown on these kind of issues"" in the past. ""The United States has always been a leader in refugee resettlement but 1,500 people over four years is such a minuscule contribution to tackling the human side of this problem,"" Miliband said on ABC.  Related: Syrian refugee crisis: senators call on US to take in thousands more The Obama administration has repeatedly pointed out that the US has provided more humanitarian assistance to Syria amid the conflict, at roughly $4bn, than any other country. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week that there ""is certainly capacity in Europe"" to deal with the flood of refugees. Earnest rejected Republican suggestions that a more ""muscular"" approach to the Syrian civil war would have prevented the crisis. ""There's not really much evidence to substantiate that claim,"" he said. ""You certainly could make the case that that might have led to a different outcome - it might have hastened the departure of President Assad, but it also would have subjected the United States to a whole host of more significant risks, including more significant outlays of funds to fund essentially a war in Syria."" Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island governor who is polling below 1% in the Democratic race, said the US ""unfortunately bears a great deal of responsibility for the refugee crisis because of our invasion of Iraq and the spread of chaos in the region as a result"". He stopped short, however, of saying more refugees should be taken in, in his statement to the Guardian. Only two of the 22 candidates vying to hold the most powerful position in world policy - O'Malley and Kasich - appeared ready to go that far.",0
1359,src_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,11/5/2016,933 words,Sally Hamwee,Talking about refugee 'pull factors' wilfully misses the point; The UK government's determination to create a hostile environment for immigrants is a xenophobic betrayal of our nation's welcoming reputation,Broadsheet,"Some years ago I remarked to a colleague how distasteful it was for parliamentarians to talk as if the atlas was still almost all coloured pink, as it was when Queen Victoria was on the throne. Though my colleague is by instinct far more rebellious than I am, he advised me that to say this in the Lords would not go down well. Language is important in political debate. Describing movements of refugees as a ""swarm"" must have been intended to press certain buttons, though I hope the prime minister has come to regret it. As he may come to regret his decision to try to stand firm against taking any vulnerable child refugees from Europe despite the protests of the British public and a significant number in opposition, both in the Commons and the Lords. While there are still lots of questions - how many; what funding will be given to local authorities; and what status will be given to the children? - the concessions announced last week are a positive first step, even if it is just a step in a continuing campaign. The decisions that refugees are forced to confront must be agonising Yet, despite this, the overarching language and rhetoric around immigration and asylum are often confused and too often poisonous. During the debates around the current immigration bill the term ""pull factor"" has been used time and again. The Home Office has been explicit about its wish to create ""a hostile environment"" for immigrants - the most vivid example being the ""go home"" vans that it sent out on the streets of London until the Liberal Democrats put a stop to it during the coalition government. A great deal of the bill is designed to send messages, predominantly: ""You are not welcome."" It paints the British people as protective of society as it functioned before the world was faced with huge movements of people, rather than as a nation that has adapted and accommodated change throughout its history. Government ministers have been at pains to stress that the UK is not a land of milk and honey and the streets are not paved with gold, at any rate not gold for them. I read those messages as more about xenophobia than a rational discussion of the benefits, difficulties and tensions that immigration brings with it. When Theresa May spoke to the Conservative party conference last year in Manchester, she said that there was no net benefit to immigration and labelled most refugees as economic migrants. Of course, there are some migrants who aren't refugees. They want a better life for their family and frankly there is nothing wrong with that. But to label them as cheats and liars and tar everyone with the same brush is a political calculation, nothing more. No doubt there are factors that pull people towards the UK, whether refugees or economic migrants. The English language is likely to be one, but for refugees surely the biggest pull factor, if you want to look at it this way, is that the UK is a peaceful and tolerant country. The overriding concern of the majority of parents, by a long way, must be the safety of their children. If you are in Iraq, Afghanistan or Eritrea, all countries where young men are forced to fight for the army or terrorist groups, you will be thinking about whether your children are better off abroad. Or you may be in, say, Aleppo, with little access to food or water and fearful of the next bombardment (I am particularly conscious of this; it's where my grandparents came from). When you compare the UK with that then yes, you could argue that this is a land of milk and honey. However, for David Cameron to argue that you'll start to see parents who aren't absolutely desperate putting their kids on boats alone to fend for themselves at the age of seven or eight is ludicrous. I am certain he would not do it to his own children. Similarly, if there are pull factors in the mix, education will be one. Syrian refugees are very aware that their children have lost in some cases five years of education. Education services in Syria have collapsed and there is not the capacity in the region to accommodate everyone's needs. The UNHCR says that 86% of Syrian refugees who came to Europe in 2015 were educated to secondary or university level, and the majority were students. They are different labour markets, sure, but last week I heard a German employer explaining how he welcomes well-educated and skilled refugees. Can the UK really be in danger of pulling people when it does not allow asylum seekers to work until 12 months has gone by from their application, and then only in ""shortage occupations"", which are very specialised, requiring considerable training? Does it pull people by asylum support of as little as £5 a day (plus accommodation - but it's not the Ritz)? Does it pull people by painting their doors red ? In 2015 there were six asylum applications for every 10,000 people resident in the UK. Across the 28 EU countries there were 26 per 10,000; the UK is 17th among the EU's 28 countries on this measure. Either we are succeeding in pushing people away, or we have little need to worry about pull factors. The decisions that refugees are forced to confront must be agonising. To characterise the decision-making process as an assessment of pull factors is a theory largely divorced from reality, and amounts to a dismissal of the thousands of Britons who have offered homes to unaccompanied child refugees. It shows a cynicism that betrays the UK's reputation as a nation welcoming of people seeking sanctuary. I realise this may sound emotional, but is there not a place for emotion, or at least empathy, in our policy, and legislation?",1

Syrian opposition fighters are grateful for the help, says Judy Samuel",Broadsheet,"Priti Patel's visit to an Israeli army base in the occupied Golan temporarily put this usually forgotten territory in the headlines ( Report, 10 November). However, despite the international coverage, there has been little attention paid to two important issues: the return of injured civilians and fighters to Syria following Israeli medical treatment, and the situation of the remaining Syrian population in the Golan who now mark the 50th year of living under occupation. First, although Israel provides medical assistance to Syrian civilians, it fails to offer them a safe haven - as required by international law - and instead sends them back to a conflict zone. Israel is also the only country neighbouring Syria that has not taken any Syrian refugees. Fighters from Syria who receive medical assistance from Israel also re-join hostilities rather than being prevented from participating again in military operations, as required by international law. Second, the conflict also has a huge impact on Syrians in the Golan, like me, who have been cut off from the rest of the Syria since the Israeli occupation in 1967. Following the occupation, approximately 95% (130,000) of the Syrian population in the Golan was forcibly transferred or displaced from their homes, and 340 villages and farms were demolished. Today, the remaining Syrian population in the Golan (26,000) is separated from friends and family in the rest of Syria, and face danger from spillover of the conflict as the region becomes increasingly militarised. Further, we suffer from multiple discriminatory Israeli policies similar to the Palestinian population. As the dust settles on the Priti Patel issue, it is vital that the Syrian population in the Golan is not forgotten once again. Dr Nizar AyoubDirector, Al-Marsad (Arab Human Rights Centre in Golan Heights) · Your headline inferring that Priti Patel was intending to donate British funds to the Israeli army was misleading and does not take into account the facts on the ground. The Israeli army has set up field hospitals to treat severely wounded Syrians who are then transported by Israeli Army helicopters to Israeli hospitals to receive expert care. It is worth remembering that most Syrians have been taught to view Israel as their mortal enemy. Having met a leader of one of the Syrian opposition groups, I would like to inform your readers about how grateful they are for all the humanitarian and medical care that they receive from Israel.

1449,src_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,25/7/2017,552 words,Graham Snowdon,Inside the 28 July edition; Brazil's right on the rise; environmental defenders in danger,Broadsheet,"I knew for sure that the Guardian Weekly 's cover story packed a real punch this week after three people involved in the production process - separately from one another - described it to me as ""scary"". Perhaps you will agree after you read our Latin America correspondent Dom Phillips's fine dispatch on the rapid rise of the far right in Brazil. As scandal engulfs the nation's politics, disillusioned Brazilian voters are increasingly looking to free-market liberals, evangelical Christians and populist rightwing extremists, with some even advocating a return to military dictatorship. Scary, indeed. As Donald Trump marks six months in the White House, we look at the impact his decisions are having on US domestic policy areas. Members of his team this week continue to try to shake off allegations of links with the Russian government. And we bid a fond farewell to Sean ""Spicey"" Spicer, now released somewhat mercifully from the oft-thankless role of presidential press officer. Conditions have been deteriorating for those left at Australia's Manus Island detention centre as operations wind down and the notorious facility nears closure. In France, the honeymoon period for president Emmanuel Macron seems to be over. In Venice, local people have reached snapping point as peak tourist season hits Italy. From Spain, we find out how hotel cleaners are organising to fight back over pitiful pay conditions. There's also a special spread of news focusing on the plight of environmental defenders around the world, who are losing their lives in the line of duty at unprecedented rates. There'll be more to come on this important and disturbing issue. In the UK, the parents of Charlie Gard finally gave up their legal battle for their critically ill baby to be flown to the US for experimental treatment, a heartbreaking case that attracted international interest and provoked discussion on several fronts. In more heartening news, we catch up with the tiny Welsh village that organised itself to invite a family of Syrian refugees to live there. The Weekly Review catches up with the rise of eSports, a world that in some ways remains hidden from view but that has a vast young fanbase and multimillionaire star players. And Discovery looks at the historical secrets of a cache of mummies found in a Lithuanian crypt. Books touches on our fascination with and fear of sharks, while Culture meets Maria Balshaw, the first ever female director of London's Tate galleries. There's also a look at post-horror, a psychological reimagining of cinema's most lucrative genre. On the back page John Mullan considers what artificial intelligence can learn from classic English literature (a decidedly dubious bag of moral and ethical behaviours, the professor concludes). It all rather raises the question: what would be the ideal human instruction manual for the aspiring young society robot? One for the Guardian Weekly's Notes & Queries community to ponder, perhaps!

1452,src_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,29/12/2015,857 words,"Clár Ní Chonghaile, Liz Ford and Carla Kweifio-Okai","Open thread: what is the best book you read in 2015?; We want to know which books on development, foreign affairs and global politics you enjoyed reading this year",Broadsheet,"While you may not have read all the books you intended to this year (who ever does?), we'd like to know your standout reads of 2015. Which books would you recommend to our readers? A novel that shone a light on a part of the world you knew little about? A non-fiction tome that helped you become an expert on a topic? Or perhaps it was a classic you'd always hoped to conquer. We welcome suggestions of fiction or non-fiction, and they don't have to be 2015 releases.  The following titles caught our eyes on the Global development desk:  New York Review Abroad, Fifty Years of International Reportage edited by Robert B Silvers A highlight for me this year was the New York Review Abroad, Fifty Years of International Reportage. Edited by Robert B Silvers, the book journeys from Vietnam, Cambodia and China to South Africa, Uganda and Egypt, by way of Haiti and El Salvador, covering under- or misreported stories from the world's hotspots over the past half a century. Susan Sontag, VS Naipaul, Joan Didion and Nadine Gordimer all contribute but Ryszard Kapuscinski 's essay Fire on the Road was the favourite for me. Kapuscinski's reputation took a bit of a hammering a few years ago, but anyone who has read Another Day of Life can be left in no doubt about the brilliance of his writing.  I also read Cynthia Enloe's The Morning After: Sexual Politics at the End of the Cold War - Enloe was one of the speakers at the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom's 100 th anniversary summit in April. Published in 1993, it was remarkable - and depressing - to find just how little has changed. Liz Ford The Crossing by Samar Yazbek  Related: Open thread: which books on development would you recommend? | Carla Kweifio-Okai The Syrian refugee crisis was the defining story of 2015. For exiled Syrian journalist Samar Yazbek, it was deeply personal and years in the making. In this compelling read, Yazbek weaves her experiences of the civil war with snapshots of the life cycle of the crisis - from early street demonstrations against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, to the multi-faceted conflict we face today.  At the heart of the book are Yazbek's illegal crossings from Turkey into Syria, in which she attempts to uncover the everyday stories of people caught in the crossfire, as well as those fighting. ""Later I told [people in Syria] about sneaking through the barbed wire to the other side. How we had crossed from being lost in one wilderness to being lost in another. It had been a moment of oscillation, of teetering on the line between exile and homeland,"" she writes.  Yazbek's beautiful storytelling, translated from Arabic into English by Ruth Ahmedzai Kemp and Nashwa Gowanlock, combined with the personal stories she tells make this a highlight of recent releases on Syria. Carla Kweifio-Okai Why Nations Fail by Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson It can be all too easy to pigeonhole countries and decide that the poverty of poorer nations is written in the stars - a consequence of geography, climate, values or economics. In a way, this analysis is comforting because it removes angst about whether we, as the global community, could do more to battle inequities.  Such conscience-salving theories are not for US academics Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. In this book, they set out to discover why some countries are richer and more successful than others, and comprehensively debunk the idea that countries are condemned to poverty by immutable realities of place or practice. Instead they expertly expose the role of political institutions, taking readers on a whistle-stop tour through time and space to elucidate their central premise - that prosperity becomes possible only when political institutions are inclusive and power is centralised. Any other combination will not result in sustainable, long-term growth.  Starting in Nogales, a town on the Mexico-US border, and journeying through ancient Rome, Mayan civilisations and England's Glorious Revolution of 1688, Acemoglu and Robinson show that sound institutions create a virtuous circle that spawns prosperity: if people feel they are protected by decent institutions, they are willing to work harder, innovate and deliver economic growth. But they will not feel empowered to do so if the institutions that govern them are, in the authors' words, extractive and bent on plundering their wealth.  Though the tone can at times seem a little didactic, the astute central premise, and abundant well-delineated examples, make for a satisfying read with enough ""aha!"" and ""yes!"" moments to keep readers turning the pages. This book offers plenty of food for thought, even three years after its publication, as we watch a slow drift towards a new era of autocracy in some African countries, and take the first steps on a 15-year journey to the better world we promised ourselves amid much hype and excitement at the UN in September.

1476,src_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,15/10/2015,550 words,Editorial,"The Guardian view on Sweden and immigration: breaking point; The reactionaries of the Sweden Democrats are exploiting Europe's immigration crisis, and creating a political emergency in Stockholm",Broadsheet,"Swedish democracy works very well providing the voters don't disagree. But ever since the last general election handed the nationalist Sweden Democrat party the balance of power, Swedish politics have been riven by substantive disagreement. The Sweden Democrats are a genuinely reactionary party. They want their country, and indeed the world, to be the way it seemed in the 1980s, before globalisation swept much of the social democratic state away, and washed in hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned foreigners. Their social and economic policies are an incoherent mess but their one political demand is clear: a massive and permanent cut in refugee immigration, to levels almost as low as British policy allows under this government. The Sweden Democrats want a cut of 95% in humanitarian immigration. This one policy demand has propelled them over the last 10 years from being an obscure groupuscule with clear neo-Nazi roots to a party with 13% of the seats in parliament, and over 20% in the latest opinion polls. The response of the other parties has been to ignore them resolutely and with equal firmness hope that they would go away. This alternative to a strategy was severely tested last December when the Sweden Democrats voted to reject the budget proposals of the minority leftwing coalition and then announced they would vote with the government to prevent any centre-right budget proposal. This threatened an emergency election, or complete paralysis. The response was to double down on the policy of ignoring the Sweden Democrats: in order to avoid an election the other seven parties in parliament came to an agreement that they would fix their votes to produce the same outcomes as if no Sweden Democrats had been elected. Since then, the European refugee crisis has developed in its tragic and astonishing magnitude, while Sweden in particular has also attracted large numbers of Roma from inside the EU, some of whom beg for a living. The two inflows have strained the policy of trying to ignore the Sweden Democrats to breaking point. There are now more than 7,000 applications for political asylum a week in Sweden and the system is almost at bursting point. There have been small riots in Malmö over the demolition of a migrant camp set up for Palestinians and a general sense that the fabric of Swedish society is under strain. At this point the small, and traditionally leftish Christian Democratic party cracked and at its annual congress repudiated the agreement reached last December. This example was immediately followed by the Conservatives. It seems that this is a ploy to put pressure on the Social Democrats to abandon their minority government and to form a more stable coalition with one or more of the centre-right parties. There is also a perceptible weakening of support for the policy of unrestricted immigration for anyone who can make it across the EU as far as Sweden. The Sweden Democrats, calling this ""the greatest catastrophe of the modern age"", have just announced a nationwide campaign for a referendum on immigration. They cannot force one, but they can ensure that tension remains high all winter. Europe should look at this crisis and learn. It can no longer expect two countries - Sweden and Germany - to do all the hard work of absorbing Syrian refugees.",0

Map showing minefields marked in red near Tovarnik where thousands of migrants have gathered Photograph: HRC  Earlier the International Campaign to Ban Landmines said the danger of mines near the border area worsened an already precarious situation facing refugees. In an email to the Guardian its director Megan Burke said: ""We are very concerned about the situation of Syrian refugees and the many risks that they face as they try to find a secure place where they can be. Landmines in Croatia are of course a very big risk and yet another reminder as to why landmines have been banned."" She highlighted maps showing the danger areas that refugees should avoid. Regional refugee groups in Serbia have been disseminating maps to refugees, she said. Burke warned refugees to avoid straying from main routes. She said: For refugees themselves, simple information such as the importance of staying on main roads and official border crossing roads and what to look out for regarding mine warning signs will be helpful for people who really don't know the areas at all, even more perhaps than trying to navigate around the possibly dangerous places. Croatia has had a responsibility to mark all known mined areas under their obligations to the Mine Ban Treaty.

The move is the latest effort by the Northern League to discourage asylum-seekers from settling there. Lombardy's regional council passed an amendment on Wednesday (41-29) that would bar any hotel that has voluntarily hosted migrants over the last three years from receiving regional funds or participating in local tenders. The measure was seen as a compromise after the Northern League, the rightwing party headed by Matteo Salvini, initially proposed that the hotels ought to be fined between 5,000 to 10,000 euros and see their licenses suspended for six months to a year. block-time published-time 11.35am BST  Germany's federal police reported 7,266 ""unpermitted border crossings"" in 24 hours on Wednesday, twice as many as the day before, with most coming across the Austrian border, writes Ben Knight in Berlin.

There have been long tailbacks on roads between Germany and Austria as commuters are being held up at the new border controls. Refugees, meanwhile, are being filtered out, made to wait, and only let across into Germany in small groups. The Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that two groups of 700 refugees each were being held at a border bridge over the river Saalach, near the German town of Freilassing, waiting to be registered at collection points and then distributed throughout Germany. Der Spiegel's foreign affairs editor Raniah Salloum pointed out that reintroduced border controls appear fairly lax. enltrGerman Federal Police: 7266 refugees entered Germany on Wednesday.

He told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper that 800 suspects were already in Bavarian custody. Germany also strengthened controls on its borders with the Czech Republic on Wednesday and Thursday, where four suspected traffickers had been arrested since Wednesday, police said. In a separate development, the head of Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) Manfred Schmidt handed in his resignation on Thursday ""for personal reasons"".

Hungarian government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, said its razor wire fence was protecting EU borders against illegal immigration and that other countries should put up similar barriers and be prepared to defend them. Speaking at press conference he said: ""Hungary is not going to just let people go through its territory and that's what we've achieved. If everybody took care of their external borders, all European member states, especially those who have a Schengen border, the situation would be very different. That's why we are calling for the Greek seas to be protected, if not by Greece, then by a joint European force that is able to stop illegal migration."" Kovacs added: ""We don't like the fence. But it seems to be working to protect the country's borders, to stop illegal migration. Obviously we are going to continue with that - keeping the fence, protecting the fence by police.

Here's a rundown of the latest developments. Thousands of migrants have entered Croatia from Serbia in the past 24 hours after Hungary sealed its border, national state-run HRT television reported. Foreign Minister Vesna Pusic said that the country was prepared for the arrival of migrants but could not cope if the numbers increased dramatically. The Croatian Red Cross said 5,400 people had arrived. The UN's secretary general Ban Ki-moon has sharply condemned Hungary for using force against refugees. ""I was shocked to see how these refugees and migrants were treated. It's not acceptable,"" Ban told a news conference. The number of refugees who entered Germany on Wednesday more than doubled to 7266. ""Most of them were picked up when crossing the German-Austrian border"" a spokeswoman said. Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann is holding crisis talks with his central European counterparts. In Zagreb he met Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic who has vowed that his country would allow free passage of migrants across its territory. Later he is due to meet Slovenian premier Miro Cerar who has taken a tougher line on immigration.

That for many she has brought the smack of firm management back to a Home Office that was hardly ever ""fit for purpose"". That many think it wouldn't be so bad if she brought that same smack of firm management to the party itself. She herself may well be one of them. We know that quite a few see her as a good sort in a crisis. Yesterday, she presented as a good sort to know in a climbdown. The home secretary was assailed in the Commons over claims that the government has been thus far unwilling to go the extra mile for refugees left starving and desperate by the crisis in Syria. The thrust of the government response has been to send aid and they have sent a great deal of it. But the admission to the country of more refugees; that's a tricky one in the present atmosphere, especially for a government wary of creating hostages to boost the fortunes of Ukip. The government is having a rethink, we learned. But the government is, as yet, mid rethink. It fell to the home secretary to hold the line. But it wasn't easy. Yvette Cooper, May's shadow, accused her of failing to provide a humanitarian response.""Last week the home secretary refused to come to the house to answer a question on vulnerable Syrian refugees and sent the immigration minister to convey her decision that Britain would not provide sanctuary to vulnerable refugees, torture victims, abandoned children and others that we and others we urging her to help."" There has been a lot of pressure since, said Cooper. Was the home secretary paying attention? To a point, said May. ""The United Kingdom has a fine record in terms of the amount of money we are providing in humanitarian aid, which is the largest sum of money of any of the European Union countries."" We had taken several thousand asylum seekers from Syria over the years, she said. What of refugees resulting from the crisis here and now? ""I am indeed working with the foreign secretary to see what further support can be provided by this government and further announcements will be made on that in due course,"" she said. Cooper tried again. Would she agree in principle to sign up to the UN programme aiding refugees too vulnerable to be helped in the camps? You'll have your answer, May said. Just not yet. Ming Campbell, grave, austere, rose. ""The UK as a permanent member of the security council has a particular obligation . . . surely this is a matter for humanity on the part of this government or are we to allow our moral compass to be set by Mr Nigel Farage?"" Still, despite the provocation, a straight bat from May. I have heard the concerns, she said. David Winnick had a go. You'll know something before we vote on Wednesday, he was told. Something is in the mix. But the lady, unyielding, resolute, was not for telling. Her day was uncomplicated to that point. She had time to crow; net migration down a third since 2010 with net migration from outside the EU lower than it has been since 1998, measures to stop illegal immigrants ""abusing our public services or the labour market"" in the pipeline, crime down, police reforms working.

Our borough is now home to nine families and we hope to welcome more people throughout the year.  Yana, 20, fled Syria in 2013 when her brother was imprisoned and her house destroyed. The youngest of six siblings who have been scattered around the globe by the conflict, Yana has settled in well in Islington. She recently passed her first accountancy exams and her English has blossomed as she has made friends, including in a Red Cross-run choir she recently joined. Stories such as these are a testament to the contribution they've made to our community and evidence of a smooth transition into our borough.   Related: I work with child refugees in Calais. Theresa May's deception is a cruel act | Benny Hunter Yet issues remain that have made the process of resettlement harder than it needs to be, particularly the Home Office's insistence that those who have arrived under the government's Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) be granted five-year humanitarian protection visas instead of typical refugee status, which affords people the ability to travel and access to student finance as well as to some social security support. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to the families we have welcomed. As grantees of humanitarian protection, those who have arrived under the Syrian VPRS scheme are not entitled to a UN travel document. Instead, they must either use their own passport or apply for a certificate of travel. At £218 per person, this is unaffordable for many of those who only recently escaped a horrific civil war that is still ongoing. The matter is compounded by the fact that many countries - including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt - do not accept such a document or are very unlikely to. The Home Office has told us of a case in which at least one family obtained these documents only to be subsequently turned away as they attempted to travel. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to families  Kaya Comer-Schwarz  As for their own passports, of the nine Islington families, only three have valid Syrian documentation; one family's passports expire shortly. Many have close family - children, parents and siblings - in Europe and around Syria. To make matters worse, help with family reunion is now outside the scope of legal aid, like so many other issues. The inability to travel to see relatives is proving to be seriously distressing to these families. In some cases, it is preventing us from effectively supporting them to integrate. Late last year we urged the Home Office to reconsider this disparity between the two definitions. We are not alone in doing so: recently the Commons Public Accounts Committee made similar calls in its report on the VPRS scheme, pointing out that granting humanitarian protection rather than refugee status risked people missing out on access to some public services It would greatly assist us in providing the best support to families, without incurring additional costs, if refugee status were granted through a fast-track process set up in consultation with experts on asylum law and policy.

Ever. Ever. Ever.""  Related: Donald Trump used $258,000 from his charity for legal settlements, reports say The plainly inaccurate statement, which was immediately lambasted on social media for failing to consider the long history of slavery and racial discrimination against African Americans, marked the latest misstep by the Trump campaign as the Republican nominee has struggled to harness the terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey for his political advantage. A day after the apprehension of suspected bomber Ahmad Khan Rahami, Trump made his remarks in Kenansville, North Carolina, and repeated familiar themes to crowds at multiple rallies across the swing state. ""Immigration security is national security,"" he said, and repeatedly read the lyrics of the The Snake, a 1960s soul song about a woman who finds a dying snake and nurses it back to health. The snake then fatally bites her. To Trump, this was a parable about the consequences of the United States taking in refugees. The Republican nominee went on to describe Clinton as ""the vessel for all the global special interests seeking to run our lives"" and said that the ""failed political establishment"" had ""vested"" in her ""all of their money, all of their hopes for another generation of corruption"". Trump also argued that the ""dishonest media"" had ""bled this country dry"". But, Trump ran into more controversy when the Washington Post reported that the billionaire converted $258,000 in donations to the Donald Trump Foundation to settle lawsuits against himself. The payments represent an apparent violation of tax laws that could potentially even force the IRS to shut down the Trump Foundation. Trump further stoked controversy by bragging on Tuesday about spending ""OPM - other people's money"".  ""There's nothing wrong with doing things with other people's money,"" said the nominee when talking about his business career. His campaign also had to deal with criticism after his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr, compared Syrian refugees with poisoned skittles in a tweet on Monday night. The tweet set off a major firestorm and even the candy maker distanced itself from it with a spokesperson saying: ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people."" Trump Junior followed up on Tuesday morning when he shared an article from a far right wing website that claimed, without evidence, that ""tens of thousands"" of British women have been tortured and raped by gangs ""comprised almost exclusively of Muslims"". The firestorm caused by the younger Trump's tweet even forced a response from running mate Mike Pence who told NBC News's Kelly O'Donnell in an interview: ""It is remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr, when Hillary Clinton's calling for a 550% increase in the Syrian refugee program.""  The Republican nominee suffered another potential blow when it was reported that former President George HW Bush would vote for Hillary Clinton in November. Bush apparently told Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the daughter of Robert F Kennedy and former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland, that he would be casting his ballot for Clinton. She shared the news in a Facebook post, which the Guardian obtained.  Jim McGrath, a Bush family spokesman, told the Guardian: ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim."" Trump's busy day came as Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton stayed off the trail in advance of Monday's presidential debate, the first between the two candidate. Although the former secretary of state did a radio appearance and held a conference call with national security advisors, she held no public events. As a result, Trump jibed on Twitter : ""Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!""",0

""I'm a pharmacist. My husband and me had a beautiful life, a beautiful house. Everything was fine, but we have lost everything. In Jordan, life is completely different. We have nothing, no jobs, there is nothing to do, we can't work because it's illegal,"" she said. For the next three weeks, Sham and a dozen other Syrian women will weave their personal tales into an adaptation of Euripides' antiwar tragedy The Trojan Women in theatres around the UK, starting with a sold-out run at the Young Vic in London. ""In the play we can talk about our suffering, about what we want, about what we are dreaming about,"" Sham said at a press conference at the Young Vic. For Reem, the play Queens of Syria is a chance to put a human face on the worst humanitarian disaster since the second world war. As the Syrian conflict enters its sixth year. more than 4 million Syrian refugees are living in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt with no prospect of returning home in the near future and with little opportunity to restart their lives in exile. ""Refugees are not considered people,"" said Reem. ""We are not seen as educated. I was studying to be an engineer at Damascus University. We were forced to leave Syria because of war. My father was a lawyer, his office is destroyed and now he is depressed."" It was Reem's mother who put her name down for the original workshop three years ago in Amman. The project was started as an exercise in drama therapy and consciousness-raising by Charlotte Eagar, a former foreign correspondent, her husband, William Stirling, and Georgina Paget, a film producer.  Eagar was not sure anyone would turn up for the first workshop. Twelve did, and the numbers went on to reach 50. The original production was staged in Amman to great acclaim. ""I thought it would be a superior school play but it was absolutely spine-chilling,"" said Eagar of the first night. It has been a struggle, financially and bureaucratically, to bring the play to the UK, where it will go on to Oxford, Liverpool, Edinburgh and elsewhere after its London run starting on Tuesday night. ""This is an opportunity for people in the UK to hear from the refugees themselves. It will be invaluable,"" said Oliver King, executive director of the charity Developing Artists, who fought hard to bring the project to Britain. ""We have had to spend a fortune on legal and visa fees."" The play, directed by Zoe Lafferty, has changed over time as the cast has shrunk to 13 women - two could not get visas - and personal circumstances have changed. Although none of the women are professional actors, Lafferty has been deeply impressed by the quality of their performance in rehearsals in Jordan and since their arrival in the UK on Sunday.

The celebrities, including musician and producer Brian Eno, actor Juliet Stevenson and Michael Morpugo, the children's author, have each signed up to a buddy system, to support unaccompanied minors in the ""Jungle"" migrant camp with UK links.  They have agreed to visit them in France or their families in the UK, to contribute towards their legal and humanitarian costs and to urge the British and French governments to provide safe passage for all unaccompanied children. Citizens UK have estimated 150 children in the camp have a legal right to reunite with their families in the UK. They currently have 70 active cases with children in Calais, and estimate that there are another 80 who would qualify for family reunion. The initiative, organised by a collaboration of refugee organisations including CitizensUK, HelpRefugees and Good Chance Calais, was announced after President François Hollande called on the UK government to speed up the process of reuniting unaccompanied minors with their families in Britain. Hollande said on Thursday that if children in Calais had UK families they ""should go to the United Kingdom quickly and efficiently.""  The ""Jungle"" shantytown, which houses up to 3,500 refugees and migrants trying to reach the UK is being partially dismantled by French authorities, following an order from the French prefecture. Some of the wooden shacks housing children have already been destroyed. Earlier this year, four Syrian refugees were admitted to the UK by order of the British courts, a move thought to set a limited precedent and raise hopes a couple of hundred minors with families in the UK could also be admitted. Refugee groups warned that due to the evictions at the camp this week minors were more at risk because they were harder to reach. Major Nick Coke, of Raynes Park Salvation Army and Citizens UK, said: ""With evictions beginning in earnest and these minors' homes being demolished we must act urgently to ensure these children are not lost, scattered across northern France and away from the humanitarian protection they need and the legal support they require to reunite with their loved ones."" Josie Naughton from Help Refugees said: ""No human should have to endure the awful conditions of the Calais 'Jungle' let alone children who have loving homes to go to. We welcome the buddies to our team and are grateful for their assistance in helping us provide humanitarian aid to these children while they wait for reunification or proper protection from the authorities."" A statement on behalf of the celebrities said: ""We call on the British and French authorities to immediately make provisions for the safe passage of all the unaccompanied minors and refugee children identified by Citizens UK with verified family connections to Britain. ""These children have a full legal right to reunite with their loved ones. It is unacceptable that they are left in danger and distress for administrative convenience. The system established to reunite these families must either be set aside, or made to work as a matter of extreme urgency. ""We are each buddying with one unaccompanied minor to ensure that they receive the humanitarian support they need and to personally insist that both governments honour their obligations to these children."" Law and Cumberbatch were among 145 figures who signed a letter to David Cameron last month, urging him to take action to postpone the demolition of part of the Calais camp, until they are either given full child protection within the French system or reunited with families in the UK. Those who have signed up to the buddy system include actors Gillian Anderson, Stephen Daldry, Laura Bailey, authors Ali Smith and Andrew O'Hagan, journalist and television presenters Mariella Frostrup and Mark Cousins, comedian Shappi Khorsandi, and Sir Christopher Bland, former ITV deputy chairman.",1

Related: Brussels attacks: EU security ministers hold emergency terror talks - live Some world leaders have raised questions about the ease of access to Europe by terrorists, and criticised Belgium's record of responding to the threat of terrorism before the deadly attacks in its capital. At least three suspected suicide bombers in the Brussels attacks had known links to the terror cell behind November's carnage in Paris, and one was flagged as an Islamist militant and deported from Turkey in June 2015, it has emerged. The emergency meeting involving security and justice ministers comes amid reports in Le Monde and Belgian broadcaster RTBF that a potential new suspect may have been captured on CCTV at the metro station bombing - bringing to five the number of terrorist who may have been involved in Tuesday's atrocities.  The EU has said Thursday's meeting was to show solidarity with Belgium as well as to discuss ""the actual state of play in the fight against terrorism"" and to hurry along legislation.  Thirty-one people were killed in twin suicide attacks on the Zavantem international airport and the Maelbeek metro station, with more than 300 people from 40 different countries injured.  Following the attacks on Paris in 2015, and now the Belgian capital, numerous European leaders have voiced concern that ""the future of Schengen is at stake"" and that free movement between EU borders has weakened security.  The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, called for approval of a passenger name records directive requiring airlines to hand over passenger details to EU countries.  The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, called for a ""security union"" and said he hoped the EU would adopt proposals by the commission for the protection of external borders. Meanwhile the UK's Telegraph reported the EU had written to Belgium on 29 February demanding the country improve its ""deficient"" border security. The organisation reportedly called for Belgium to overhaul its system, noting untrained border officers and failures to run mandatory security briefings or check arrivals from high-risk countries against counter-terrorism databases. Turkey said on Wednesday it had warned Belgium that Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, who acted as a suicide bomber at the Brussels airport, was a suspected foreign fighter when it deported him to the Netherlands in 2015.  His brother, Khalid, is believed by authorities to have carried out the bombing of the metro station, and Najim Laachraoui has been tentatively named in Belgian media as the second airport bomber.  Before the bombings all three were being sought by police in connection with the Paris attacks, and were believed to be linked to one of the Paris terrorists, Salah Abdeslam, who was arrested in Brussels last week. During a raid on an apartment in Schaerbeek, police found a laptop containing a note written by Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, saying he suspected the police were searching for him, and he didn't want to end up in prison. A third man seen at the airport - pictured on CCTV in white and believed to have escaped - remains unidentified and is the subject of an ongoing manhunt. In response to Turkey's statement about Bakraoui, the British defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said it was too soon to begin criticising Belgian authorities before an investigation was complete. Fallon said the terrorists wanted to ""create mayhem"" in European cities, including London, and said UK troops were on standby should Islamic State attack Britain. ""The armed police are the first response - they are being increased so there are now armed police, more visible at railway stations, airports,"" Fallon said. ""The number of armed response vehicles is being increased in our big cities.  ""So that is in hand, but as back-up to come in behind the armed police, we now have military in reserve and they are able to call up troops - some 5,000 at 24 hours' notice and more behind that."" After this week's atrocities, ministers and leaders from the US, Israel, and Australia have also criticised Belgium's security system. Yisrael Katz, Israel's transportation minister, accused the nation of not doing enough to combat Islamist extremism. ""If in Belgium they continue eating chocolate, and if they continue to enjoy life and to appear as great liberals and democrats, and do not recognise that some of the Muslims are organising terror, they will not be able to fight them,"" said Katz on state radio. The US secretary of defense, Ash Carter, said America's European allies needed to do more alongside US efforts in the Middle East to fight Isis. ""The Brussels event is going to further signify to Europeans that, as we have been accelerating our campaign to defeat [Isis] in Syria and Iraq and elsewhere, they need to accelerate their efforts and join us,"" Carter told CNN. And on Thursday the Belgian ambassador to Australia rejected accusations by the country's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, that Europe's security was weak and Isis was using the Syrian refugee crisis to send operatives into the region. Ambassador Jean-Luc Bodon, said the statement was unfair and ""dangerous because it's precisely what Isis wants - that we would make a confusion between terrorism and migration and between terrorism and Islam"". Amid the international reaction, the identities of those killed and injured in the attacks are emerging. Three of the dead have been named. Peruvian woman Adelma Tapia Ruiz was killed at the airport. Her husband, Christopher Delcambe, and their twin three-year-old daughters survived after they stepped outside the departures area for the girls to play, shortly before the explosion. The death of 20-year-old Belgian law student Leopold Hecht at the Maelbeek metro station, was confirmed by Brussels' Saint Louis University. It said in a Facebook post Hecht was ""one of the unfortunate victims of barbaric acts"". Oliviere Delespesse, an employee of the Federation of Wallonia-Brussels, was also killed at Maelbeek. Another 28 fatalities are yet to be publicly identified, and it's not clear whether the three suicide bombers are included in that number. The identification process has been complicated by the violence of the attack and the number of foreigners among the victims. Social media is awash with the names and faces of people considered to be missing. More than 300 people of 40 different nationalities were injured. Half were still being treated in hospital, with 61 still in intensive care. Four, all in a coma or medically induced coma, are unidentified.",0

An unprecedented full EU summit with Turkey agreed a fragile pact aimed at stemming the flow of migrants to Europe via Turkey. But the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, frustrated by the resistance in Europe to her policies, also convened a separate mini-summit with seven other leaders to push a fast-track deal with the Turks and to press ahead with a new policy of taking in and sharing hundreds of thousands of refugees a year directly from Turkey. The surprise mini-summit suggested that Merkel has given up on trying to persuade her opponents, mostly in eastern Europe, to join a mandatory refugee-sharing scheme across the EU, although she is also expected to use the pro-quotas coalition to pressure the naysayers into joining later. Merkel's ally on the new policy, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, said of the mini-summit: ""This is a meeting of those states which are prepared to take in large numbers of refugees from Turkey legally.""  Related: Hiding in plain sight: inside the world of Turkey's people smugglers But he added later that any such agreement would be voluntary and not binding, while the Dutch rejected German-led calls to resettle large numbers directly from Turkey. The frictions triggered by the split were instantly apparent. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council who chaired the full summit with Turkey, contradicted the mainly west European emphasis on seeing Ankara as the best hope of slowing the mass migration to Europe.  ""Let us not be naive. Turkey is not the only key to solving the migration crisis,"" said Tusk. ""The most important one is our responsibility and duty to protect our external borders. We cannot outsource this obligation to any third country. I will repeat this again: without control on our external borders, Schengen will become history."" He was referring to the 26-country free-travel zone in Europe, which is also in danger of unravelling under the strains of the migratory pressures and jihadist terrorism. Juncker said he will come up with a system for redistributing an annual ""contingent"" of refugees from Turkey among the coalition of the willing countries. Reports in Berlin put the figure at 400,000. He is expected to leave that until after the looming French regional elections for fear of boosting the chances of the anti-EU, anti-immigrant Front National of Marine Le Pen. David Cameron said: ""This summit matters because we need a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis in Europe and obviously that involves Turkey. ""Britain will continue to play our role, which is about supporting Syrian refugees in the refugee camps and in Turkey.

Downing Street said: ""They agreed that we continue to make good progress. While some areas are more difficult than others, discussions are ongoing with member states to find solutions and agree reforms in all four areas outlined in the PM's letter to the European Council president. ""These discussions will continue in the coming days, including with bilaterals between the PM and other European leaders in Paris tomorrow, and all EU leaders will have a substantive discussion of the UK renegotiation at next month's European council as planned.""",1

""For a number of reasons we can minimise the risk posed to our country, not least of which is the fact that if we have any hesitation in relation to a particular application we discard it and move on to the next one. ""We don't wait for people to arrive and work out if there's a problem.

Paul Rafferty, humanitarian settlement services manager at the metropolitan migrant resource centre, told Guardian Australia the family was settled into temporary accommodation - a furnished house provided by the centre - on Monday night.  ""They will stay there while we help them find their own accommodation on the private rental market, usually about 28 days,"" Rafferty said. The centre, which coordinates most humanitarian arrivals in Perth, will also help enrol the children in school, set the family up with Centrelink and Medicare, and provide referrals for healthcare and trauma counselling.  Rafferty said there were fewer than 100 Syrians in Perth and the centre was trying to encourage community members to set up a formal association so new migrants could easily find them. ""That is one of the difficulties here with a new group of arrivals when there's not an established ethnic group here,"" he said.

Speaking as his predecessor Hillary Clinton urged America to ""lead the world"" in responding to the Syrian emergency, Kerry said the total number of refugees taken by the US yearly would rise from 70,000 to 85,000 next year and to 100,000 in 2017, Reuters reported. ""The need is enormous, but we are determined to answer the call,"" Kerry said, during remarks in Berlin. Kerry reportedly did not say whether any of the additional refugees would be from Syria. Earlier on Sunday, Clinton said the US should take in more than six times the 10,000 Syrian refugees that has been proposed by President Barack Obama. ""We're facing the worst refugee crisis since the end of world war two, and I think the United States has to do more,"" Clinton said on CBS. ""And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000."" Kerry's predecessor as secretary of state said the US should vet applicants to prioritise welcoming the ""most vulnerable"" people who have fled the Syrian civil war, such as Christians and Yazidis who have faced religious persecution from Islamist militants. Clinton's remarks brought her into agreement with Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland who is a rival for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. He urged Obama to accept 65,000 displaced Syrians during a flashpoint in the crisis earlier this month. A group of 14 Senate Democrats cited the same figure in a letter to Obama four months ago. Clinton also urged United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon to convene an international meeting at this month's annual general assembly in New York, in order to push states to commit more funding and support for the Syrian relief effort. Speaking days after a senior US general disclosed that a $500m ""train and equip"" programme had resulted in only four or five American-backed Syrians actually fighting the Islamic State, Clinton conceded: ""We have a failed programme."" She stressed that she had urged Obama to begin such operations several years ago while serving as the most senior US diplomat. ""A lot of what I worried about has happened,"" she said. ""Where we are today is not where we were."" Clinton said the US should persevere with arming moderate elements and provide more support to regional allies.

Greening said the long-term solution to the crisis was to give people hope that they could have a better life in their own countries, rather than trying to intercept boats crossing the Mediterranean. Speaking to the Guardian, Greening said: ""People are not prepared to accept a life sentence of poverty just because of where they are born. We are seeing people driven by conflict or by the hope of getting a job. These people are on our doorstep. ""They see people in the world living better lives and say, why can't I have a better life myself?"" Britain has sent the flagship HMS Bulwark to the Mediterranean to help rescue migrants and Greening said she fully backed attempts to crack down on the criminal gangs based in Libya. But she said the EU needed to ""tackle the root causes of why people are moving in the first place"".  Greening added: ""We need the EU collectively to step up to the plate. The UK is doing a lot because we have got to 0.7% (of gross national income spent on overseas aid). Our leadership comes from the fact that we are backing our words with action. The EU needs to bring its development budget to bear and so do member states."" She said the response to the UK's message had been positive. ""There is a growing realisation of the fact that the way you choke off the supply of people that the human traffickers rely on is through development.""  Britain is one of only four EU countries that has met the UN target for spending 0.7% of national income on aid. None of the other major EU countries - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - were close to reaching the UN goal in 2014.  At a meeting of EU development ministers in Brussels this week, Greening stressed the dangers of not using financial assistance to help create jobs and prosperity in poor countries. She said: ""There are consequences of not being prepared to to work with other countries to help them become more prosperous. I was urging other EU member states to work collectively to tackle the root causes of the migration problem."" Germany, which is hosting a meeting of the G7 group of industrial nations in Bavaria next month, has just announced an increase in its aid spending. Greening said: ""There are the beginnings of a realisation that the lack of development around the world has clear domestic ramifications. The world is shrinking. People see that we live better lives in Europe. They notice the remittances being sent home. They ask themselves why they should have a life sentence of poverty."" The government has spared aid from the spending cuts of the past five years and, despite heavy criticism from some Conservative MPs and parts of Fleet Street, George Osborne has continued to ringfence Greening's budget. She said her department was shifting its focus to economic development, adding: ""We want to turbo charge growth."" Greening told the meeting of EU development ministers that of the 5,000 migrants who died at sea in 2014, 3,000 perished in the Mediterranean. Those making the perilous crossing, she said, were following the basic human instinct of searching for a better life. Britain's response to the civil war in Syria, which has resulted in 4million refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries, has encouraged Greening to think that big migration flows can be halted if people feel they have the chance of a decent life. ""When I meet Syrian refugees, the discussions I have are about their for the future. Overwhelmingly, they want to go home. They have moved across the border for safety and are making lives for themselves as best they can."" ",1

While more than 100 years ago the Red Cross established the right to healthcare in conflict zones, the right of refugee boys and girls to continue their education, irrespective of borders, has yet to be won. But this week in the village of Akroum, which is in the extreme north-east corner of Lebanon close to the Syrian border, a group of exiled Syrian teachers teamed up with Akroum's local village school to ""timeshare"" the building. For several half days each week, outside of normal school hours, they teach the refugee children. These teachers are unpaid volunteers who are taking children off the streets, preventing many from becoming child labourers or even beggars, and already doing what only education can do - providing the children with hope that there is a future worth preparing for. Now, a small Scottish charity, Edinburgh Direct Aid - moved by their plight and aware that the language of Lebanese education is French and English and that Syria is Arabic - is delivering textbooks in Arabic to the school and have offered to fund timeshare projects across the country. The Akroum experiment is a small illustration of what can be done to meet the educational needs of children in the most appalling of situations. It challenges the international community to support a big idea: for the first time in conflict zones providing universal education provisions on a similar basis for all 400,000 school-age children who are now Syrian refugees in Lebanon. By using 1,500 schools dotted across Lebanon in areas where refugees are huddled in tents, prefabricated huts and tenements, this could be achieved. With the support of the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, and the education campaigner Malala Yousafzai, an ambitious plan has been drawn up costing $195m (£117m) a year to repeat across Lebanon what the Akroum school and the Syrian exiled teachers have achieved for one small area. The simplicity of the concept, crafted by Kevin Watkins, director of the UK-based Overseas Development Institute, is that it can be operational within weeks. Instead of having to build new camp schools for refugees, exiled Syrian children will use existing Lebanese schools on this two-shift system. Members of the public have an opportunity to personally donate to make the plan a reality through any one of 500,000 Western Union outlets throughout the world, with the money transfer company matching the first $100,000 (£60,000) donations. Lebanon is dealing with a refugee crisis on an unimaginable scale. Half of the 2 million Syrians already displaced from their country have fled for neighbouring Lebanon, where they make up one in four of the population. Every month an additional 50,000 make the same journey. But this project has won the support of the Lebanese government, whose prime minister Najib Mikati has this week reiterated his support for the Global Education Initiative,showing that in even the most hopeless of situations it is important to ensure that a generation of children does not miss out on education. The appeal comes just a week after the second international pledging conference for Syria, which was held in Kuwait City on 15 January and raised only one third of the emergency aid the UN needed. Currently education is the main loser as health, nutrition and shelter take priority in the allocations. Last year only one pound in six of the appeals for education should be met. But young people need more than food, a home and vaccinations: they need hope, which is what education offers, allowing children to plan for the future and preventing young people, already scarred by war, from becoming a ""lost generation"". If, through the creation of the Red Cross and later Médecins Sans Frontières, the right to healthcare even in conflict has become the norm for more than a century, then we can achieve the same for education in 2014, and prise open a window of hope amidst the increasing despair.",1

If polls are anything to go by (in Germany they're deemed reliable), Angela Merkel is heading comfortably for a fourth term in office. The economy is doing well, confidence is high, and Mrs Merkel's main opponent, the Social Democrat Martin Schulz, has failed to land any damaging blows on her. So the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) is steady in the polls at 37%, and the SPD (Social Democrats) can only muster 20%. Most of the suspense centres on what kind of coalition might emerge under Mrs Merkel this time. The CDU and the SPD have been in coalition since 2013; will that be renewed? Or will a different pattern emerge, perhaps one excluding the SPD but combining the CDU with the liberal, business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), 9.5% in the latest polls, and the Greens, currently at 7.5%? Few now expect the kind of political upheaval which might produce a coalition between the SPD, the Greens, and the former communists of Die Linke. This placidity is a tribute to the resilience of Europe's most powerful leader. At the age of 63, Mrs Merkel, who was first elected in 2005, is on her way to reaching her mentor Helmut Kohl's record of being modern Germany's longest-serving chancellor. Just as she was underestimated when she first entered politics in 1990, as a young physicist from East Germany, Mrs Merkel's talent for political survival was somewhat overlooked in the aftermath of the 2015 refugee crisis, which some thought would lead to her downfall. Two years on, Germany's ""welcome culture"" may have faded, but for most voters Mrs Merkel remains a safe pair of hands. She has always had an instinct for the centre ground, where a majority of voter sympathies lie, and the slogan she is running under makes this clear: ""For a Germany where life is good and we enjoy it."" This may be dull to the point of smugness, but a Germany sticking to moderation, and not wading into rash, fringe or extremist politics, is good news for Europe and for liberal democracy at large. And after the defeat of Marine Le Pen in this year's French elections, it brings vital confirmation that there is nothing inevitable about a populist wave overtaking the continent. But there are ripples of that wave even in this election. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is set to enter parliament for the first time, with polls giving it between 10 and 12% of the vote. Originally created in 2013 by a small group of academics and intellectuals opposed to the EU single currency, the AfD later morphed into a xenophobic entity, feeding anti-immigrant sentiment. Most importantly, it has captured the malaise of eastern Germans who feel they were given the wrong end of the stick after German reunification in 1990 - their social woes left unaddressed, their identity disregarded. A country with substantial trade and budget surpluses still struggles to convince parts of its population that it won't be left on the sidelines. Germany's role in Europe has grown spectacularly in recent years when a series of almost existential shocks threatened the European project - the financial crisis, Russia's aggression in Ukraine, and the great influx of Syrian refugees. What comes out of this election matters greatly to the EU's future. German policies on Brexit are unlikely to change, whatever some leavers here may hope. But French plans to introduce a budget and a finance minister for the eurozone - which deserve support - may be obstructed if the next coalition includes the FDP, a party strongly hostile to anything that smacks of financial transfers. Mrs Merkel owes her likely re-election to German domestic factors, not least the strength of the economy. But she has also been a driving force for the EU, despite obstacles and in the face of criticism. If Europe is to truly catch ""the wind in its sails"", as Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU commission president, urges, the chancellor will have to think and act increasingly as a European politician - not only a German one.",0
1633,src_theguardian_raw3.docx,The Guardian,1/2/2017,734 words,Harriet Sherwood Religion correspondent,Finsbury Park mosque wins apology and damages from Thomson Reuters; North London mosque included on global database for banks and other financial institutions linking it to terrorism activities,Broadsheet,"A north London mosque has won an apology and damages from Thomson Reuters after it was erroneously included on a global database linking it to terrorism activities. Finsbury Park mosque said Thomson Reuters had agreed to pay £10,000 in damages plus legal costs as well as making a statement of regret.  World-Check, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters, compiled the database for leading banks, financial institutions and other financial services organisations.  Following the subscription-only risk assessment, the mosque's bank, HSBC, closed its account, and other banks refused to take the mosque's custom.  Sara Monsoori, representing the company that now runs the mosque, said in a statement in open court that the mosque was the subject of profile reports that placed it in the ""terrorism"" category. ""This was wrong,"" she told the deputy high court judge Richard Parkes QC.  ""The profile referred to press reports and allegations from many years ago, long before the mosque was reorganised and the claimant company was established.""  Following publication of the profile, the mosque's bank ""terminated its banking relationship and closed its account"".  The Reuters agency had admitted its report ""made the false allegation that there were grounds to suspect that the claimant had continued connections to terrorism"", Monsoori said.  She added that Thomson Reuters had stated it did not intend to suggest ""that the claimant had any current or suspected connections to terrorism, and any such suggestions have now been withdrawn by the defendant which has made clear its regret"".  It had removed the defamatory allegations and agreed to pay damages and the mosque company's legal costs to settle the legal action, Monsoori said.  Oliver Murphy, appearing for Thomson Reuters, confirmed Monsoori's statement to the court, adding: ""The defendant is here today through me to express its regret for publishing the allegations.""  Finsbury Park mosque was associated with the radical cleric Abu Hamza until 2005, when it was taken over by new management. Now led by Mohamed Kozbar, it is seen as a model of community relations. Kozbar told a press conference: ""We are very relieved that this case has been concluded and that we have been vindicated. We were completely baffled when our HSBC bank account was abruptly closed, without any reason given and furthermore no other high street bank would allow us to open an account.""  Kozbar said the mosque had changed from ""a hostile atmosphere to a cohesive atmosphere. We have put the history behind us and moved forward. We have opened our doors to everyone, Muslim and non-Muslim, and we have fantastic relations with our neighbours.""  He described the mosque as a community centre involved in social action programmes with other organisations and faith groups. It had zero tolerance of terrorism, he added. ""This case has been very important to clear our name,"" he said. Farooq Bajwa, the mosque's solicitor, said: ""We believe there are many other such instances in which individuals and entities have been denied banking services, had their bank accounts closed or encountered various other difficulties which we believe is due to their appearance on the subscription-only World-Check database, which they would not personally have access to. We have been contacted by a number of potential claimants."" Risk databases are used not just by banks and financial institutions, but also by government agencies such as immigration services, he added.  According to Kozbar, Donald Trump's ban on Syrian refugees and people from seven Muslim majority countries from entering the US in recent days was helping to fuel Islamophobia, racism and discrimination. ""Far-right extremism is on the rise. There is a platform for these people,"" he said. A report published on Wednesday by the anti-racist organisation Hope Not Hate warned that anti-Muslim prejudice had ""gone mainstream"" in Europe and north America.  ""With the inauguration of Donald Trump... anti-Muslim activists - self-styled counter-jihadists - have an ally in the White House,"" said the report, Going Mainstream. ""Prominent anti-Muslim activists are now at the very centre of power and decision-making in America."" ""Counter-jihadists"" believe western civilisation is under attack from Islam, and that secular, liberal society is aiding Islam through mass immigration into Europe and policies of multiculturalism, the report added.",0

But five years since the violence erupted, the group are reuniting for a cathartic tour - and opening Glastonbury",Broadsheet,"Five years ago, the 90-strong Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music drew stars from Plácido Domingo to Gorillaz to perform with them at their home in Damascus Opera House. Today, with the bitter civil war still raging, its musicians are scattered across the globe. Some former performers of the prestigious orchestra and the choirs that accompany it are refugees in the Middle East, Europe and the US, while others are still struggling to live and perform in the conflict-torn country. ""Music, these days, is like a painkiller,"" says Raneem Barakat, a singer in the orchestra's choir. The 24-year-old regularly braves bombs and snipers on the roads on her two-hour journey to Damascus to study and perform. ""You have to take the risk. When I sing it hypnotises me; I leave reality.""  Related: Syrian refugees reveal their heartache through music For the first time since the war began, former and present members of the SNOAM have been reunited by Damon Albarn's music collective, Africa Express. Alongside guest stars such as Paul Weller and Bassekou Kouyaté, they will play a series of concerts across Europe, opening the Glastonbury festival and performing on 25 June at the Southbank Centre at a concert which will be also be live-streamed around the world, including in Syria and the Zataari refugee camp in Jordan. The call to prayer when you are on the top of the mountain in the early morning in Damascus just leaves you speechless  Damon Albarn  It's an ambitious project, and when I arrive in Amsterdam to watch the first day of rehearsals it's already hit a problem; the violin bows are moving in perfect unison, but the conductor is missing. Issam Rafea, who led the orchestra in Syria, and with Damon Albarn came up with the reunion idea, cannot leave the US, where he is applying for refugee status. His predicament typifies the logistical problems the organisers have faced. Trying to get visas for 50 Syrian musicians almost sunk the project before it began; just a week before rehearsals were due to start, it still wasn't clear they could get the Schengen visas needed to book the performers' flights. Africa Express co-founder Ian Birrell tells me they have hired a Boeing 737 to transport all the musicians and I hear dark rumours about desperate calls to British officials. But Rafea's absence also highlights the emotional temperature of the performances. The conductor's brother is one of the orchestral musicians and his sisters sing in the choir; this was their first chance to see their sibling since he left Syria in 2013. Albarn's own relationship with Syria began eight years ago when he was introduced to Eslam Jawaad, a Syrian Lebanese rapper who had worked with Wu-Tang Clan. The pair hit it off: Jawaad performed for the track Mr Whippy on Albarn's concept album the Good, the Bad and the Queen, then toured with Gorillaz - and finally took Albarn to visit Syria. He fell in love with the country overnight. ""It blew me away,"" Albarn tells me, enthusing about everything from a drunken meeting with a Bedouin Sheik (""I'd had a lot of arak"") to motorbiking around the Acropolis in Palmyra in the moonlight. ""Young people would start their evening in Damascus, go to Beirut for the night and then come back to Damascus to chill out,"" he says. ""The call to prayer when you are on the top of the mountain in the early morning in Damascus just leaves you speechless."" While there, Albarn met Rafea the conductor and recorded with the Syrian National Orchestra for the Gorillaz album Plastic Beach. A year later in 2010, Gorillaz, along with guest stars including Bobby Womack and Mick Jones, joined the orchestra for a concert in the 1,000-year-old Damascus citadel. When Albarn's group toured Europe, members of the orchestra - including Rafea - went with them. The burgeoning relationship ended abruptly with the uprisings of 2011. As the conflict has taken hold, Albarn says he has watched with horror the way Syrian refugees have been cast as a ""homogenous shadow from the Middle East moving slowly towards us"". ""I just felt: 'What can I do?"" And so he decided to get the Syrian National Orchestra back together, ""Blues Brothers style"". ""I want people who see these concerts to experience the humanity of this homogenous shadow which they feel so threatened by."" he says. He links the attitude towards refugees with the rise of the right, pointing to the way that Brexit campaigners have sought to exploit the crises. (""Honestly, hand on heart, I will consider leaving the country if we leave,"" he says). But he has tears in his eyes as he talks about how much Syrians have lost and his hope that the concerts will show people how important it is to support them. As rehearsals begin, Albarn wanders around joking with musicians - at one point rushing out to rustle up baklava, dates and tea. And, while he seems relaxed, he is mentally marking the pieces that work, and where he and other collaborators - from Tunisian singer Mounir Troudi to Mauritanian singer and harpist Noura Mint Seymali - will fit in to the live show. Alongside a string section (violins and double bass) there are more classical Arab instruments: the ney, a flute, a qanun, a zither. For the performers themselves, listening to the energetic rhythms and voices from their homeland is particularly affecting. Oud player Maher Mahmood tells me how touching it is to be once more with his colleagues and friends from the orchestra. The 30-year old fled the country in 2012, to avoid conscription, but did not escape all the violence. ""Everyone will tell you of moments where there was an explosion in front of you and you are lucky to be alive; this happened to me twice,"" he says. ""But the worst thing was seeing Syrians dying in the street."" Other musicians have endured kidnappings, or being hit by shrapnel, he says, and everyone has lost family members and friends. But living as a refugee brings its own challenges. ""The worst thing for me was leaving my parents, brothers and friends. I had a good job, a good life. It was a challenge to learn to live without everything; a human being is not just a person, we are our connections too,"" says Mahmood. After struggling to earn enough money with his music in Jordan, Mahmood was invited to perform in Denmark. He claimed asylum there, but then had to spend five months in a refugee centre, waiting to hear if his claim would be approved. ""Music helped me not to go crazy,"" he says. ""Even in the centre I would practise for hours. My teacher and I would sit on Skype, playing to each together, discussing technical points and new things."" They shot at my university bus. Another friend got her head blown off. Some of my friends were kidnapped, 'disappeared'  Munir Bu Kolthoum  Twenty-five-year-old Munir Bu Kolthoum, a Sufi-inspired hip-hop artist - and graphic designer - echoes Mahmood's words. A guest star for the tour, Kolthoum left Syria for Jordan after suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I started losing my mind,"" he says. ""I had to get away. They blew up eight tonnes of TNT close to where I live; if it wasn't for a red traffic light, I would have been dead. ""They shot at my university bus. Another friend got her head blown off. Some of my friends were kidnapped, 'disappeared'; we still don't know what happened to them."" Unwilling to take medication for his panic attacks and hallucinations, and unable to afford counselling in Jordan, Kolthoum says ""music was my only therapy"". He has told his stories through his music which has brought him a wider audience among displaced Syrians around the world. ""Half my fan base are refugees now,"" he says. ""I am mad proud of my people. They are surviving all these odds and proving how talented and brave they are.  Watching the rehearsals in a baseball cap and a baggy shirt, Kolthoum says he is thrilled to be performing with the orchestra. ""As kids they were our musical heroes.""""The media tries to show us as savages. As terrorists. But there are different sides to every country in the world; there is the musician and the graphic designer and the coffee-shop worker. We need to show the normal side."" As the musicians begin a soaring western-influenced piece they move in perfect rhythm. But politically the orchestra is divided, with some performers supportive of Bashar Al Assad's regime and the stability and prosperity they say it once provided. Others who have fled the country are opposed to it. How can they play together? Violinist Sousan Eskandar, who now lives in Germany, is adamant they will make it work. ""It doesn't matter if we all have different opinions, we have to find a way to bring them together. Maybe you make good points, maybe I do; [but] we can become one. ""When there is violence in the world, you have to make more beautiful music, and make it more intensely."" As the rehearsals come to a close with a rousing love song to Damascus the choir take celebratory selfies and start to dance. For Mahmood, it is a homecoming, of sorts.  ""When you hear [the orchestra's] big sound again it is strange and touching,"" he says. ""It takes you back to Damascus, to our memories of this sound ... in some moments, as we were playing, I could smell Damascus.""  The Orchestra of Syrian Musicians with Damon Albarn & Guests are at the Royal Festival Hall, SE1, 25 June, live-streamed at YouTube/AfricaExpress.

Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said he had written to the Polish government warning that recent alterations to the workings of Poland's highest court posed ""a systemic risk to the rule of law "". The publication of a formal opinion ratchets up pressure on Poland and marks the first time that the EU executive has criticised a member state under its rule-of-law procedure. The Polish government reacted furiously to the move and accused Brussels of blackmailing Poland in an attempt to force the country to take more Syrian refugees. Soon after Poland's ultra-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in October 2015, the Polish parliament passed a law allowing the government to appoint the judges of its choosing to the highest court and not recognise those chosen by its predecessor, the liberal Civic Platform party.  Related: The rule of law is under assault in Poland | Steve Crawshaw Legal experts advising the council of Europe have concluded that the changes breach the rule of law, democracy and human rights. If Poland refuses to back down, it could face the ultimate sanction of being stripped of EU voting rights, although Brussels is keen to avoid that scenario. Timmermans said he had spoken to the Polish prime minister, Beata Szydlo, on Tuesday night and was pleased that she wanted their ""dialogue to continue"". Rejecting accusations of interfering in Polish politics, Timmermans said he was ""dispassionate and legal"" and that the commission had a duty to uphold the rule of law.  ""The European Union is built on common values enshrined in the treaties,"" he said. ""Making sure the rule of law is observed is a collective responsibility of all EU institutions and all member states."" But Poland's justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, claimed the commission was using the rule of law issue to force Poland to ""take tens of thousands of refugees and migrants"". ""The commission intervenes when it is convenient for the commission,'' he said, accusing Brussels of blackmailing Poland to force the country to take more than the 7,600 Syrian migrants agreed.  ""This confirms that the European commission has been influenced by [Poland's] political opposition to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign state,"" he said.  Along with other central European countries, Poland opposes attempts by Brussels to set refugee quotas and fine countries that won't take in asylum seekers. Parliamentary spokesman Rafal Bochenek said Poland could solve its constitutional crisis without support or pressure from Brussels. The government's goal is ""to end the dispute over the constitutional court as soon as possible"", he said, adding that a revised law might be adopted in July at the latest.  But senior figures in PiS have previously said the constitutional tribunal crisis could be solved only by creating a new constitution for Poland. The government has for more than two months refused to publish in an official gazette an opinion issued by the constitutional tribunal on the changes imposed on it by the government. This means the court's critical ruling is not valid.  Ahead of Wednesday's decision, the head of PiS, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, condemned the EU action as a ""made up"" procedure. Speaking to pro-government Do Rzeczy, he said the decision ""can be challenged in the court of justice of the European Union at any moment"". The government has remained publicly defiant in the face of pressure from Brussels and the US, including a series of high-level visits. The EU foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, is due to visit Warsaw on Thursday. Warsaw has two weeks to respond to the commission's opinion. If it fails to meet the EU's concerns, the commission could spell out specific steps it wants the Polish government to take. If the standoff between Brussels and Warsaw continues, the dispute will be sent up to EU leaders. But Poland is unlikely to face the harshest penalties. The EU could only remove Poland's voting rights if member states agree unanimously there has been ""a serious and persistent breach of the rule of law"". Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has already said he would never let that happen. Orbán, a close ally of Kaczynski, has had his own battles with Brussels over sovereignty. In 2011, he agreed to change a law restricting press freedom, after pressure from the commission. The EU introduced the rule-of-law procedure in 2014, after years of struggling to deal with lapses in democratic standards among member states. Timmermans called on the Polish government to act quickly. Polish leadership was needed in the EU, he said, and should not be distracted by an issue that can be solved.",0

He had run out of domestic opportunities to stir up his supporters for next month's referendum to extend his powers. But he finally found the occasion abroad when the Netherlands barred Turkish ministers from addressing rallies of Turkish people living in the country ahead of the referendum.  Related: Recep Tayyip Erdogan: 'We know Dutch from Srebrenica massacre' For Turkish people, Erdogan's escalating war of words against the Dutch, from branding them ""Nazi remnants"" and ""fascists"" to accusing them of contributing to a massacre of Muslim men at Srebrenica in 1995, comes as little surprise. During his career he has fuelled international crises to generate domestic support. Now, once again, he is stirring up nationalist sentiment and exploiting nostalgia for Turkey's imperial Ottoman past. What's more shocking about this tit-for-tat row is the near-xenophobic discourse coming from the Dutch side. It makes me think that the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, is no less in need of inflammatory populist politics than Erdogan, in order to see off the challenge of the far-right, anti-Islam Geert Wilders, whom he faces in Wednesday's election. Voters tempted by Wilders' Freedom party may be reassured by the unprecedented force used to disperse Turkish crowds that gathered in Rotterdam after the Turkish family affairs minister was detained and escorted to the German border, and Turkey's foreign minister was barred from flying to the city. But the police dogs and horses that stopped the demonstrators gave Erdogan a priceless opportunity to talk about human rights violations in Europe.  Austria, Germany, Denmark and Switzerland have all cited security reasons for not permitting Turkish officials to campaign at rallies aimed at Turkish expats allowed to vote in Turkey's forthcoming referendum. It is as if European leaders now regret sitting at the bargaining table with Erdogan to stop Syrian refugees from coming to Europe. It is almost as if Europe wants to distance itself from this unpredictable, ""Middle Eastern"" leader. However, European leaders are simply reacting to Islamophobic parties in their own countries and the relentless populist politics of Erdogan. In doing so they are fanning the flames of racism at home and playing into Erdogan's hands in Turkey. Neither Erdogan nor his Dutch counterpart are thinking of the long-term consequences of their row. Expelling ambassadors, closing airspace to diplomats and ratcheting up the rhetoric will make not only Turkey but also Europe a less liberal society in the future. In Turkey, we would call this a ""fishermen's fight"". Fishermen fight with boat oars. It appears epic from a distance but neither of the enemies can really harm each other. However, it makes them look strong and adds to their heroic image in the eyes of their supporters. That is why this conflict was the perfect option not only for Erdogan, but also for Rutte. Both need to win nationalist votes to fulfil their political ambitions, and there could not be a better occasion than this so-called crisis. The night the government announced political sanctions against the Netherlands, two hashtags dominated Turkish social media. Pro-Erdogan trolls rejoiced with #EuropesfearofErdogan, while critics of the government mocked them by reversing it as #ErdogansfearofEuropa. As expected, most of the government supporters tweeted under the wrong hashtag. Therefore government trolls with better English, like desperate traffic policemen at a jammed roundabout, were warning the government supporters to go to the right hashtag. The maddening confusion among the government supporters was a sign of them being unable to keep up with the speed of the manufactured crises. They were already weary of showing up for recent crises with Russia and Syria. Every time Erdogan changes his mind, they have had to change their sincere anger to brotherly love in hours, and then back to anger if necessary. Some of Erdogan's supporters burned the French flag, as they thought that Hollande must be the president of Holland For the Dutch crisis, Erdogan's supporters have done some of their most creative work. They stabbed and squeezed oranges in public, because the Dutch football strip is orange. (The oranges were local, of course.) They posted selfies while ""beheading"" a tulip. Some of them burned the French flag, as they thought that François Hollande must be the president of Holland, and tweeted insults in broken English at the French president. Critics of the government, meanwhile, found the ridiculous situation too far beneath them to make serious comments. They contented themselves with making jokes about Turkish ministers wanting to visit the Netherlands because of a craving for space cakes and mushrooms. Since the Turkish media has been silenced, comments reminding Erdogan of human rights violations in his own country couldn't go beyond social media posts. But the uncompromising Dutch attitude towards Turkey has handed our president a gift, providing him with the perfect opportunity to start a new war of words. This is a fight that can only hurt ordinary people in both countries, who are looking on with increasing embarrassment and anxiety.",0

Meanwhile, Donald Trump has spent the last two weeks successfully castigating the Republican delegate process as a rigged game. His opponents' brightest idea was to jointly announce their plans to rig it even more. That is a kind of plan. Then again, so is burning down your house to collect the insurance money. Here's the strategy: Cruz will focus on friendly territory in Indiana, while the ""moderate"" Kasich focuses on friendly territory in Oregon and New Mexico. How the rest of the states get divvied up is anyone's guess, as is how much money Kasich will have on hand for the states he's supposed to lure away from media-saturated Trumpism.

There aren't many things upon which Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree, especially as they court very different Delaware voters ahead of a primary on Tuesday. But the candidates for president share an affinity for the same nondescript two-storey office building in Wilmington. A building that has become famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax through the so-called ""Delaware loophole"". The receptionist at 1209 North Orange Street isn't surprised that a journalist has turned up unannounced on a sunny weekday afternoon. ""You know I can't speak to you,"" she says. A yellow post-it note on her computer screen reads ""MEDIA: Chuck Miller"" with the phone number of the company's director of corporate communications. Miller can't answer many questions either, except to say that the company does not advise clients on their tax affairs. The Guardian is not the first media organisation to turn up at the offices of Corporation Trust Centre, and it's unlikely to be the last. This squat, yellow brick office building just north of Wilmington's rundown downtown is the registered address of more than 285,000 companies. That's more than any other known address in the world, and 15 times more than the 18,000 registered in Ugland House, a five-storey building in the Cayman Islands that Barack Obama called ""either the biggest building in the world, or the biggest tax scam on record"". Officially, 1209 North Orange is home to Apple, American Airlines, Coca-Cola, Walmart and dozens of other companies in the Fortune 500 list of America's biggest companies. Being registered in Delaware lets companies take advantage of strict corporate secrecy rules, business-friendly courts and the ""Delaware loophole"", which can allow companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of the state.

The campaign will deploy at 203 campuses in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Illinois and Colorado - which are expected to be pivotal in the contests for the White House and Congress. ""We don't think that climate change can be separate from the other critical issues that are on the table in 2016,"" he told a conference call with reporters, going on to define global warming as a justice issue. ""In terms of talking to voters, to try to separate climate change from economics, to try and separate it from clean air and clean water is impossible and a mistake. We are going to be talking about this in broad terms. We are going to be connecting it to other issues."" The green billionaire spent nearly triple the budget for his millenial voters' project - $70m - supporting congressional candidates with strong climate records in the 2014 midterms - but to little effect. Two of Steyer's high-profile picks lost their races to Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado and Joni Ernst of Iowa. This time around Steyer said his NextGen Climate group would focus on registering millennial voters and getting them to the polls next November - using traditional grassroots organising, social media tools such as Snapchat, and on-campus events.

Immigration!; Brave little Boris has had plenty to say - much of it delusional - in the contest David Cameron never wantedEU referendum polling day - live updates,Broadsheet,"Where did it all start? With rows over Maastricht back in the 1990s? With the rise of first the BNP and then Ukip in the 2000s? History is an endlessly rewriteable feast. But for the sake of convenience, let's say this referendum took shape as David Cameron's sop to the Eurosceptics in his own party. Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless - remember him? - had defected to Ukip and the prime minister was desperate to make sure no one else jumped ship before the 2015 general election. Open civil war is never a good look, so Dave promised a referendum sometime before the end of 2017 just to shut them up. What Dave hadn't counted on was having to go through with it. Like everyone else, he had assumed he would either be in opposition or part of another coalition government. Either way, he would have someone else to blame for his inability to deliver on his promises. But within weeks of the Conservative election victory the Tory Eurosceptics demanded their referendum payback, so Dave started visiting the 27 other EU member states frantically trying to renegotiate a better deal for the UK while insisting he was playing hardball. By February he had concluded his negotiations. Having spent the previous six months claiming the EU was urgently need in reform, Dave was now convinced the concessions he had achieved - an emergency brake on in-work welfare benefits for migrants and a general promise for Germany and France to be a bit nicer to us - were a major breakthrough and announced he was going to campaign vigorously for Britain to remain. Others were not so quick to come forward. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who had previously always spoken out against the EU, found himself at odds with the vast majority of his party and initially tried to pretend the referendum wasn't really happening before being forced to half-heartedly mumble pro-remain speeches from time to time. Theresa May was rather more successful in her Trappist vows and after whispering ""I'm backing remain"" so quietly that no one heard her, she retreated into a convent for the duration. She will go down in history as the most silent home secretary in British history. Anyone might think she was hedging her bets. As, it seemed, was Boris Johnson. Over the years, the former London mayor has contradicted himself on so many issues he's not an easy man to second guess, but Dave was fairly confident Boris would come out on his side. How wrong he was. After agonising for at least an hour during a game of tennis with his sister, Rachel, Boris decided the best way for him to advance his political career was to back Brexit. If Brexit were to win, Boris could be prime minister inside 18 months. ""This is the most difficult decision I have ever had to make,"" he sobbed. Though you wouldn't have guessed that from his behaviour, as from then on he wasted no time in rubbishing the EU at every opportunity. With Boris coming out for Boris, the referendum campaign could begin in earnest. Oxford-educated Boris and Michael Gove v Oxford-educated Dave and George Osborne. Or in Boris's delusional mind, the little people v the establishment. Dave and George because it was hard to get any other high-profile politicians to campaign with them; and Boris and Michael because they had already fallen out with Nigel Farage and the Grassroots Out Ukip faction and because the public either didn't like their other supporters, such as Iain Duncan Smith, or had no idea who they were. Gisela Who? Initially the economy dominated the debate, with Osborne claiming every family would lose £4,300 a year and Boris insisting the UK gave the EU £350m a week. The Treasury select committee investigated both claims and found them both to be false, though Boris's were the work of greater fantasy. Boris dismissed this as Project Fear. Then every independent economic thinktank in the universe said Britain would be worse off if it left the EU, and Gove insisted we shouldn't trust experts and, besides, they were all just Nazi sympathisers. Every country in the universe - apart from North Korea - said Britain would be better off in the EU. Boris declared that Kim Jong-un might have a point. Having lost the economic argument, Boris and Gove shifted the debate to immigration. The way to reduce the number of immigrants, they insisted, was to stop people from the EU coming in and let in loads more migrants from outside the EU instead. That way, even if we had exactly the same number of immigrants we could take back control and prove the UK wasn't racist. Or something. Farage wasn't at all happy about this and launched a poster campaign suggesting that Britain was about to be over-run by the Syrian refugees who were actually in Slovenia. Within hours, the Labour MP Jo Cox had been murdered and the rest of Ukip's poster campaign was binned. Punctuating all this were a series of televised debates between the leaders of the campaigns in which everyone said exactly the same thing they had been saying for the four months. At some point, Corbyn might even have joined in to say something about workers' rights. The leave supporters cheered everything Boris said, the remain supporters cheered everything Dave said, and the polls remained neck and neck.",0

In an open letter to David Cameron, the economists argue that as the world's fifth-largest economy, the UK ""can do far more"" and are calling on the government to take a ""fair and proportionate share of refugees, both those already within the EU and those still outside it"". They are also calling for safe and legal routes to and within the EU, including the UK, and ""fair and thorough procedures to determine eligibility for international protection wherever it is sought"".  The economists, who include Mark Malloch-Brown, a former UN deputy secretary general and government minister, and Peter Sutherland, the former director general of Gatt and the World Trade Organisation, wrote: ""The costs in human wellbeing of the refugee crisis, however calculated, are so extremely high that it is morally unacceptable for the UK not to play a fuller part in taking in refugees.""   Related: Syrian children need an education - rich countries must give $1.4bn to fund it | Malala Yousafzai and Muzoon Almellehan It is the first time that such a large group of economists have criticised UK government immigration policy, and follows other open letters to the prime minister from the UK's 350 top judges and lawyers, and 27 charities and NGOs including Oxfam, Amnesty International and the Refugee Council.  David Cameron's government has agreed to take up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years, from the camps on the borders of the war-torn country. More than 1,000 have arrived so far.  The numbers are dwarfed by the 1.1 million refugees taken in by Germany last year and 160,000 in Sweden, the highest in Europe as a proportion of the population. However, they and other EU countries are now trying to drastically reduce their refugee inflows.  The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, told the World Economic Forum last month that if Europe works together it can turn the challenge of tackling the refugee crisis into an opportunity that will boost growth. The economists argue that the UK's offer of 20,000 resettlement places to Syrians outside the EU is ""too low, too slow and too narrow"". They noted that the UK in its recent history has ""taken in far higher numbers of asylum seekers and refugees and at far greater speed and managed it well"". They write: ""Refugees should be taken in because they are morally and legally entitled to international protection, not because of the economic advantages they may bring. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the economic contribution of refugees and their descendants to the UK has been high.""  They noted that the thousands of Ugandan Asian refugees, whose arrival in Britain in 1972 was greeted with initial anxiety, went on to make an ""extraordinary contribution"" to British life, as Cameron himself has observed.  One of the signatories, Prof Lawrence King, of Cambridge University, said: ""Britain is the world's fifth-richest economy. It is a travesty to suggest that the best Britain can do in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since the second world war is to take 4,000 refugees annually over five years, which amounts to 12 a day. Britain has actually accepted fewer refugees in the past two years than it accepted per year in the previous 16 years."" The economists also called the UK's refugee policy ""misguided"" as it tried to deter refugees from travelling to the EU by refusing to accept those who have fled to Europe. They said in the letter: ""That misunderstands the intolerable 'push' factors that are forcing people out of countries of persecution and from neighbouring countries in which a humanitarian disaster is escalating in the camps. It is the parallel of the government's earlier policy of trying to 'deter' travel by scaling down search and rescue in the Mediterranean - a failed policy which cost lives."" Last week, the government performed a partial U-turn when it agreed to take in some unaccompanied Syrian refugee children who are already in Europe, and set up a £10m fund to support them. But Cameron insisted the focus remained on taking child refugees from camps in the Syria region.

The lasting damage to its international authority if it betrays its responsibilities shouldn't be underestimated."" Another signatory, Sir Richard Jolly, a former assistant secretary general of the UN, said: ""The human cost of failure is far higher than even the most pessimistic financial cost."" Prof Guy Standing of Soas added that welcoming more refugees would be a ""sound economic policy, not just because many of the refugees will prove energetic, innovative and resourceful, but because they will help revive the image of Britain in the world, so that people will be more inclined to 'buy British' and invest in Britain. The costs set against the longer-term benefits would be minimal"". Analysis published last month by the International Monetary Fund found that the influx of refugees into Europe could deliver a long-term economic boost to the EU if they are well integrated into the job market. Signatories to the letter also included Prof Ian Goldin, former vice-president of the World Bank, John Eatwell, founder of the Institute for Public Policy Research, and Ha-Joon Chang, the bestselling author of books such as Economics: The User's Guide.

To cheers from the faithful, Trump read out a statement referring to himself in the third person: ""Donald J Trump is calling for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."" Americans are used to such venom dripping from the lips of talk radio hosts and the occasional Fox News anchor. But to be uttered by the frontrunner for the nomination of one of the two main parties was more than many had bargained for. What once had been considered hate speech confined to the margins of political life is now out and proud in the mainstream. ""Probably not politically correct,"" Trump said afterwards. ""But I don't care"".   Related: The Guardian view on Donald Trump: the joker in the pack | Editorial This is a large part of his appeal. He articulates the frustration and bewilderment of that section of uneducated, unskilled, low-paid white America, whose wages have stagnated and social mobility has stalled that is nostalgic for its local privileges and global status. In recent times, they have lost wars, jobs, houses and confidence.  So when he brands Mexicans ""rapists"", Chinese ""cheats"" and all Muslims potential threats he gives free rein to their insecurities about an increasingly cosmopolitan and less predictable world they feel they have been excluded from. To that extent, his base is not too different from that of the Front National, which just triumphed in the French regional elections, Ukip or any of the range of far-right parties currently making headway in Europe.

""This uncertainty, exacerbated by an inability of states to secure economic sovereignty in the era of globalisation, can translate into a lack of tolerance of any sort of collective stranger.""  Trump was responding in part to shootings in San Bernadino, California, where a Muslim couple, claiming to support Islamic State, killed 14 people. The mass shooting - the 353rd this year - was defined by the FBI and Barack Obama as a ""terrorist incident"". For those who see the presence of Muslims - and not the easy accessibility of guns - as the central threat the shooting represented not the routine occurrence of gun violence in the US but a particular pathology stoking a lurking fear.  Trump did not invent Islamophobia in the US. In a Pew research poll from last year, which asked people to rate different religions from 0 to 100 - with higher numbers suggesting more positive feelings, Islam came last with 40, just behind atheists (41) and way down among Republican voters (33). Indeed, while Trump's fellow Republicans rounded on him on Monday, few expressed outrage just two weeks ago when he proposed a database to track Muslims living in the US. Nor was he alone in advocating discriminatory measures.  Ben Carson, one of his main contenders for the nomination, suggested Syrian refugees should be screened as though they were ""rabid dogs"". Meanwhile, two other Republican hopefuls, Texas senator Ted Cruz and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, both suggested prioritising Christian refugees from Syria first.  Related: Donald Trump's real threat is making extreme bigots seem moderate | Owen Jones  But while the race to the bottom has long been on, Trump was always uniquely well positioned to win it and leverage anti-Muslim bigotry for electoral gain. One poll, earlier this year, showed Trump's supporters are among the most negative towards Muslims among Republicans, with 77% of his supporters believing ""the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life"".   Few among his Republican challengers were ever prepared to challenge him head on. When they did, it seemed to do little damage, which allowed his bigotry to fester in the public square. His support, which had been waning until the Paris attacks, has since shot up - as have t he number of Islamophobic attacks in the US. So while his comments drew a stern rebuke from across the political spectrum, it remains to be seen if they will do him any harm. The more the establishment round on him, the more his supporters hail his outsider status and celebrate the notion that he is breaking a taboo.   Related: 'We see Donald Trump as a loser': Muslims across Asia react  The fact that his xenophobic binge has done little to damage his status among the Republican faithful says a great deal about the party.

While the court appeared to side with the Trump administration on the president's authority to temporarily bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, immigration lawyers and civil rights advocates said the majority of travelers from those countries would still be permitted to enter the United States under the supreme court's directive. ""I think it's a vast exaggeration to say this is a victory for the president,"" said Jennifer Gordon, a professor of law at Fordham University who focuses on immigration. Noting that at least five justices agreed on the need to grant visas to individuals with a ""credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States"", Gordon argued that the court's decision reflected a seemingly majority consensus that the Trump administration could not implement an outright ban on immigrants from the six-Muslim majority countries. ""In fact, you might read it as a signal ... that the president might well lose on this,"" she said. The president and his surrogates have championed what they claim was a 9-0 ruling in Trump's favor. In fact, though, the tally represented what is known as a per curiam opinion - on behalf of the court, as opposed to individual justices. In essence, the court agreed to hear oral arguments on the merits of the executive order. At least three conservative justices on the bench - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch - would have preferred to have allowed the travel ban to go into full effect, but ultimately the court significantly narrowed the scope of Trump's order. Margo Schlanger, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, who also headed the civil rights and civil liberties division at the Department of Homeland Security under Barack Obama from 2010-11, said the supreme court had actually paved the way for the bulk of travelers affected by the ban to come into the US. ""In reality, the travel ban remains largely enjoined,"" Schlanger said. ""If [travelers] didn't have a real connection - a job, or enrollment at a school, or a family member - they wouldn't be able to get visas. ""Most of the travel that's covered by the travel ban remains stayed,"" she added. ""I think the Trump administration is spinning."" Schlanger acknowledged that the supreme court's ruling did not represent a ""home run"" for the plaintiffs, since the court had not chosen to simply uphold the injunctions by district courts in both Hawaii and Maryland that had previously blocked the Trump administration from enforcing either the travel or refugee ban at all. The fate of refugees was now arguably the most uncertain, as they too would be subject to having a ""bona fide relationship"" in order to gain admission to the US during a 120-day period. The supreme court did not lay out examples of what would count as such in the case of refugees, although it did for other travellers, prompting sharp criticism from advocates. ""The Court's ruling will leave refugees stranded in difficult and dangerous situations abroad, including those who have already waited a long time for US resettlement,"" said Hardy Vieux, the legal director of the advocacy group Human Rights First. ""Many of these individuals may not have 'bona fide relationships', but have strong reasons to look to the United States for protection."" It was not immediately clear if refugee resettlement groups in the US, or religious entities that have sponsored refugees fleeing war-torn countries, would qualify as ""bona fide"" connections. The number of refugees admitted to the US has already fallen by nearly half in the initial months under the Trump administration, when compared with Obama's final months in office. Top Democrats voiced concern that the court had enabled Trump to at least partially see through his pledge to ban both Muslims and Syrian refugees from the US. ""The Trump Administration has consistently shown that discrimination, not national security, is the purpose of this ban,"" said Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. ""The Supreme Court's move to largely lift the injunctions against the open prejudice of the Muslim and refugee ban sends the wrong message to our partners on the front lines of the fight against terror,"" she added.  ""We hope that the Court will ultimately come to the only conclusion consistent with our values, our national defense and the Constitution."" The American Civil Liberties Union, which has aggressively fought against Trump's travel ban, said it remained confident that the supreme court would ultimately agree with lower court rulings that the executive order was unconstitutional.  Related: Trump travel ban Q&A: what happens next? ""The important thing, from our perspective, is to recognize how narrow the part of the ban that is being allowed to go forward really is,"" said Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrant Rights Project at the ACLU. Most of the people visiting from the six countries singled out for exclusion by the Trump administration, he noted, traveled for precisely the reasons the supreme court said should still be permissible. ""The actual on the ground effect of the partial stay that was issued by the supreme court, if the government implements it faithfully, should not be that severe,"" Jadwat said. ""On the merits of the case, we think that at the end of the day, the supreme court will agree with the other courts that have looked at this ban effort and find that it's either unconstitutional or illegal or both,"" he added. ""Ultimately, the law is on our side.""",0

1958,src_theguardian_raw4.docx,The Guardian,27/5/2016,1084 words,Paul Harvey,Cash transfers: only 6% of humanitarian spending - what's the hold up?; The aid sector is premised on external experts judging what's needed in a crisis. Why don't we trust people to know their own needs?,Broadsheet,"Humanitarian organisations have traditionally supported crisis-affected people with physical commodities such as food and shelter. But today, many NGOs are experimenting with an alternative approach. Instead of in-kind aid, a family may receive an envelope of cash, a plastic card or an electronic money transfer to a mobile phone, with which they purchase what they need locally.  During the 2011 famine in Somalia, for example, which killed more than a quarter of a million people, aid agencies used remittance companies to provide cash transfers to more than 1.5 million people. Refugees in Lebanon are also using smart card vouchers to buy goods as local shops and an existing government social protection programme in the Philippines was extended to send cash to those in need after Typhoon Haiyan. Although we do not know the exact amounts, the best estimate is that cash and vouchers together have risen as a proportion of total humanitarian spending today from less than 1% in 2004 to about 6% today. But this is much less than it should be.   Related: Boatfuls of cash: how do you get money into fragile states? The hold-up isn't the strength of the evidence which is increasingly clear and compelling. Cash transfers are among the most rigorously evaluated and researched humanitarian tools of the last decade. People spend cash sensibly: research suggests they are not likely to spend it anti-socially ( for example, on alcohol) and cash is no more prone to diversion than in-kind assistance. Local markets from Somalia to the Philippines have responded to cash injections without causing inflation. With the growth of digital payments systems, cash can also be delivered in increasingly affordable, secure and transparent ways.  People often prefer receiving cash because it gives them greater choice and control over how best to meet their own needs, and a greater sense of dignity. When people receive in-kind aid that doesn't reflect their priorities they often sell it to buy what they really need as, for example, 70% of Syrian refugees in Iraq have done. The difference in what they can sell food or other goods for and what it costs to provide is a pure waste of limited resources and means that in-kind aid is often just an inefficient way of giving people cash. It also usually costs less to get cash transfers to people than in-kind assistance because aid agencies do not need to transport and store relief goods. A four-country study comparing cash transfers and food aid found that 18% more people could be assisted at no extra cost if everyone received cash instead of food. So, given the strong case for cash, why is it still at only 6% of humanitarian spend? What's the hold-up in getting to 30%, 50% or even 70%? Part of the answer is the long tradition of governments and organisations deciding what people need, and assuming that they cannot be trusted to make sensible decisions themselves. These priorities often reflect organisational mandates and interests hard-wired into the humanitarian system. Fears that cash will be misused are deep rooted and do not simply fade away on the first sight of evidence to the contrary. Organisational inertia is also an important factor; faced with uncertainty, agencies default to familiar forms of assistance, which largely remain in-kind. Donor governments and aid agencies also fear that western publics will not support cash - seeing it as less visible or more prone to corruption.  Related: When disaster strikes, cash transfers can offer older people a vital lifeline | Toby Porter Big organisations don't change overnight and there is a need to recognise the efforts organisations like the World Food Programme, UNHCR, the Red Cross and NGOs like Oxfam and Save the Children have made in adjusting their business processes, training staff and developing guidelines to enable them to give people cash. But despite these efforts, key decision makers are still often reluctant to fully embrace the disruptive potential of cash.  Degan Ali, one of the Somali leaders of the cash response to famine in Somalia in 2011, recalled: ""Despite eight years of successful cash assistance in Somalia, aid agencies and their donors were reluctant to support cash transfers. Many donor countries had enacted anti-terrorism legislation and so aid agency staff feared prosecution should cash be diverted. In the end, we implemented the largest NGO cash transfer programme in history. But this was done despite, rather than with the support of, the humanitarian system. It was a battle, every step of the way, and in the months it took to fight it, many thousands of people died unnecessarily."" Ultimately, it comes down to trust. The aid sector in general is bad at trusting people in poverty and reluctant to hand-over power and control. It's fundamentally premised on the idea of the external experts deciding what is needed. Cash challenges that and so creates a series of professional insecurities. What will happen to logisticians and food aid professionals? And if it makes sense to deliver one cash grant to meet a range of basic needs, do we need so many organisations focused on delivering humanitarian assistance?   Related: The cash after the storm: building resilience to future disasters  Giving people cash is not always the best option, nor is it a cure-all. Sometimes markets are too weak for people to be able to buy what they need and sometimes government policies make it impossible to provide cash. But these situations are rare and often temporary. They should not be used as bad excuses for providing relief in-kind after these constraints no longer apply. Cash transfers still need to be complemented by the provision of public goods that markets will not provide efficiently, such as clean water, sanitation or immunisation. The use of cash transfers does not mean that humanitarian actors should give up their key roles of proximity, presence and bearing witness to the suffering of crisis-affected populations. Indeed, making delivery more efficient protects the time and resources of humanitarian actors to do just that.

1965,src_theguardian_raw4.docx,The Guardian,27/5/2016,1135 words,Paul Mason,"Europe's refugee story has hardly begun; With a million new refugees expected in Europe this year, Greece faces a diplomatic onslaught and an existential crisis",Broadsheet,"The refugee story has hardly begun. There will be, on conservative estimates, another million arriving via Turkey this year - and maybe more. The distribution quotas proposed by Germany, and resisted by many states in eastern Europe, are already a fiction and will fade into insignificance as the next wave comes. Germany itself will face critical choices: if you're suddenly running a budget deficit to meet the needs of asylum seekers, how do you justify not spending on the infrastructure that's supposed to serve German citizens, which has crumbled through underinvestment in the Angela Merkel era? But these problems are sideshows compared with the big, existential issues that a second summer of uncontrolled migration into Greece would bring. First, there's the diplomatic onslaught on Greece. Last week the European Commission mulled quarantining Greece by building a razor-wire fence inside the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is not even a member of the EU. German sources floated the idea of cancelling Greece's debt if only Greece would agree to jail 400,000 migrants. A Belgian minister, in an EU negotiation, is alleged - by his Greek counterpart - to have demanded the Greeks ""push back or sink"" the boats coming from Turkey, in breach of international law. Others in Europe are proposing to criminalise the NGOs that are helping the refugees as they arrive in the islands. If any of these things happen, they are likely to tear Greek civil society apart. Long before that, these demands are demonstrating to the rest of Europe the incapacity of its leading powers and institutions to face facts: the next million refugees could only be stopped by a policy of pushback that would break all humanitarian law. Problem number two is the moral implosion of the Turkish government. Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's army has already turned the Kurdish regions of southern Turkey into a war zone. Now he is pushing for life imprisonment for two prominent journalists from the secularist newspaper Cumhuriyet, for an investigation that claimed to show proof that his government was sending arms to IS. This is not some maverick judge at work - the demand for a 30-year sentence was brought by Erdogan himself: head of state of a country that still thinks it could join Europe and that retains its Nato membership, with no discouragement so far from Brussels. The third problem is the paralysis of the EU institutions. Germany unilaterally suspended the Dublin treaty, which would have forced migrants to return to Greece to be processed. Most eastern-European countries have rejected Germany's proposed redistribution mechanism, preferring a system regulated by jagged pieces of metal and police wearing surgical masks. Schengen is close to being a dead letter. Unlike the Greek debt crisis - where ""extend and pretend"" has been the watchword - this indecision, illusion and failure to confront facts is urgent. Greece is not going to ""push back or sink"" inflatables containing refugees. However many compromises Alexis Tsipras 's government made over austerity, it is full of human rights lawyers, criminology professors and people who spent their lives fighting fascism. There is outrage at Europe's demands inside the Greek political establishment, ranging well beyond the radical-left party Syriza and its small nationalist coalition partner. Eastern Europe is, by and large, going to let the refugees go to hell. There is very little compassion in the media coverage of the refugees east of the former Iron Curtain. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have swung towards populist nationalism. While there are tens of millions of liberal-minded, largely young people who are prepared to show compassion and adhere to international obligations, they do not control east Europe's governments. As for Turkey, it has, to date, taken no visibly stronger measures to keep Syrian refugees inside its own borders and prevent the deadly traffic across the sea to Greece. For a state that can arrest its own newspaper editors at will and bomb its own cities, that demonstrates a clear set of priorities. So there are only two variables: what the EU does next and what the European peoples do. If Germany has given up trying to organise the orderly distribution of refugees inside the EU, then free movement itself is on borrowed time. Everybody understands this, except the political and media classes who have to maintain the fiction that everything is fine. Germany had, by December, registered just over half the 900,000 asylum claims it is facing. The hard-right AfD party has sprung from sixth to third in the polls. Angela Merkel seems frozen in the headlights of the oncoming train. Which leaves the people. Quietly, and without rhetoric, one of the most spectacular, cross-border solidarity movements ever formed has emerged to help the refugees. Churches, NGOs, communities, police forces and social services - plus ordinary people with no big agenda - just got on and saved people, moved them along, gave them water, food and clothing, and are right now helping them to settle in. Against that, of course, there are people such as the young British men who gave the fascist salute, unmasked, to the TV cameras, during the fracas at Dover this weekend. Our grandfathers smashed fascism - outlawed it, executed its leaders, suppressed its ideas - because they knew how seductive that stiff-armed salute can be to idiots with a grievance, once all the illusions start to burn. They squeezed Germany dry of geopolitical power because they knew it had a tendency to be wielded unwisely, even by democrats. They thanked their lucky stars that eastern Europe was somebody else's problem. And they deployed an army to ensure Greece stayed pro-western and democratic. In this, the generation of Churchill and Attlee showed greater strategic vision than the current one. David Cameron's obsession with negotiating a fig-leaf concession on migrant in-work benefits from Europe seems, when set against the scale of the historic challenge, small. Jeremy Corbyn's trip to Calais did not even ask the roaring questions: what should Germany do; what should the Commission do; what should the UK Border Force do? By reverting to gestures, British politicians are already signalling strategic disengagement with Europe's migration crisis, which itself is feeding in to the negative popular perception of the EU. There is a rising concern in British political circles that the next million refugees might tip the UK electorate into voting for Brexit. I suspect that's too simple. The biggest threat to British consent for EU membership would be if the European Commission tries to force Greece to drown migrants, and then turns it into a quarantined prison camp when it refuses. People would rightly ask in whose name that was being done.",1

The leader of the Roman Catholic church is to make the intervention on Saturday during a trip the island to highlight the refugee crisis unfolding across the continent.  The Roman Catholic leader will spend five hours on the island with Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, and with Ieronymos II, archbishop of Athens and all Greece, meeting refugees and holding a service to bless those who have died trying to reach Europe.  Related: The idealists of Lesbos: volunteers at the heart of the refugee crisis Fuelling belief that the Catholic Church is at odds with the EU's stance on the crisis, an official of Greece's state refugee coordination agency said the pontiff wanted to take back to the Vatican a number of refugees. The official, who spoke to AFP, did not specify whether this would take place immediately after the pope's visit or at a later stage. It was believed three vulnerable families would be given refuge.  Imbued with added urgency on the frontline of the EU's migrant emergency, the meeting is also being seen as a further warming of ties between the western and eastern branches of Christianity, almost 10 centuries after their bitter split in 1054. The pontiff, who has publicly criticised Europe's ""anaesthetised conscience"" on refugees, will go straight to the detention centre above the hilltop village of Moria where more than 3,000 men, women and children are held. The island has become a focal point for the European refugee crisis following the influx of refugees in recent months. EU leaders agreed last month to begin deporting arriving migrants to Turkey in a bid to stop the flow of people into the continent. Greece has borne the brunt of the refugee influx with over 850,000 of the 1.1 million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis who streamed into Europe last year, coming through Lesbos. More than 50,000 migrants and refugees have been trapped in the country since Macedonia and other Balkan states cut off the migrant trail by closing borders Greece's leftist-led government described Saturday's visit of religious leaders as ""extremely significant"". Prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who met the Pope as he arrived on Saturday, was expected to underline Greece's increasingly fragile situation in talks with Francis.  The country has been struggling to house refugees in makeshift facilities even if arrivals have dropped dramatically since the deportation deal came into effect on 20 March.  For detainees who have arrived since then, conditions have deteriorated dramatically. Human rights organisations have withdrawn from Moria and other detention centres for fear of being associated with an operation of mass expulsions. On Friday, just hours before Francis' scheduled visit, detainees in the Lesbos camp chanted ""freedom, freedom"" as demonstrators denounced their incarceration. Standing under the razor wire-topped fence, Sham Jutt, a young Pakistani, spoke of the refugees' plight, saying he hoped the pope could intervene. ""We expected a life of hope and now he is our only hope,"" said the 21-year-old, adding that he had seen the camp change from being a registration centre to a prison following the controversial pact the EU signed with Turkey to stem the flows. ""Now, with this agreement, we are very afraid they will deport us.""  Related: Pope Francis and Bernie Sanders: unlikely allies in the fight for equality Before the church leaders' visit, authorities had gone out of their way to clean up the camp, whitewashing graffiti-splattered walls, replacing tents with containers, installing air conditioning and taking families out of the overcrowded facility to an open-air holding centre nearby. ""In every sense of the word, they have given it a whitewash,"" said Jakob Mamzzak, a volunteer from California. ""Today we even heard they had given [inmates] clean clothes, let them have their first shower in 25 days and brought them good food when the truth is conditions are inhumane."" Lesbos' refugee solidarity movement was hoping the pope could bring international attention to the problem. ""Since this crisis began we have acted in solidarity with refugees,"" said Nikos Zartamopoulos who, with others in the communist-aligned Pame trade union, had demonstrated outside the camp. ""We are not against the pope per se. If he can speak out, if he can highlight their plight so much the better."" The trip came as the head of the Catholic church in England and Wales said the UK's refugee resettlement programme set up by David Cameron was a ""great disappointment"".  Cardinal Vincent Nichols said Britain's response to the crisis was ""going very slowly"" and called for a major increase in the number of people being taken in.  Asked if he believed governments needed to show more humanity, the archbishop of Westminster replied: ""I do.""  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think we have the resources as a very rich country. Think of a country like the Lebanon and some of the other Middle Eastern countries where they have a proportion of refugees present which represents 30-40% of the population and they cope.  ""We are a very rich country and I think with a greater cohesiveness between a spirit of willingness that is there among many and mechanisms which governments can put into place, we could be doing more.""  He added: ""There are aspects of the government policy that are commendable but I've said surely that can be speeded up. Surely in the first year we can see really how many could be taken and then multiply that by five. At the moment it's going very slowly and it's a great disappointment.""  The prime minister announced plans to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in Britain at the height of the crisis. The scheme will cost more than half a billion pounds, the government revealed earlier this week.  Nichols dismissed suggestions that the UK should not be taking in refugees because some Britons are struggling to make ends meet.  He told the programme: ""I don't think the struggle of people in the destroyed villages in and around Mosul and other parts of Syria, those struggles are not the same as our struggles.""  He added: ""They are people like ourselves and they are desperate and we should open our hearts as well as our political and financial resources."" ",1

There is a constant queue of women for clean nappies or hygiene kits, which contain sanitary towels, wet wipes and toothbrushes. ""I had my period when we walking across the border from Afghanistan to Iran,"" says one woman. ""We were walking for days and I had nothing. I had to use dirty rags and leaves.""

I will never forget that,"" says Georgios Frantiz, head of Lesbos programmes for ActionAid. Moria refugee camp is a shambles. There is limited electricity at night, nor is there heating in the shared family sleeping units provided by the UN refugee agency UNHCR. Shower blocks are overflowing. There is no proper allocation process for accommodation, meaning many women and children sleep in flimsy tents surrounded by groups of men. Fayma, from Afghanistan, is en route with her two small children to meet her husband in Germany. ""On the first night here me and the kids were sleeping outside. We were so scared, but now we have got into the family compound. At night there's no light. I have no idea how long we will stay here. My money got stolen so I don't know what to do. I need to find a way to contact my husband."" Frantiz says he is seeing increasing numbers of single women or women with children with similar stories. ""There are many cases where the male of the family travels first, secures asylum and the woman and children follow. I can't tell you how many because no one is collecting the data. We also have a lot of women with medical problems, without money, women without a specific destination and not informed about what they can access or how they can access it. And we have cases where women have been subject to violence and harassment - both within the camp and en route."" Amnesty International says women and girls face violence, assault, exploitation and sexual harassment at every stage of their journey to Europe. The organisation interviewed 40 refugee women and girls in northern Europe last month who travelled from Turkey to Greece and across the Balkans. All the women described feeling threatened and unsafe during the journey.  ""I've heard shocking stories of the steps women are taking to try and protect themselves, such as not eating or not drinking to try and avoid going to the toilet. I met one woman who had got a very bad bladder infection and was peeing blood because of that. Others were sleeping on beaches rather than risk being in tents or rooms surrounded by men. This isn't new. We know this is a problem. There are no excuses any more,"" says Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International's crisis response director. The British government has provided nearly £16m to help deal with the crisis in the Balkans. About £4.5m is for Greece. The UK's Department for International Development (DfID) says it is focusing on protection of civilians, including women and girls; the issue will be a key topic for DfID at the supporting Syria and the region conference, which the UK is co-hosting in London next month. But for Mike Noyes, head of humanitarian response at ActionAid UK, female refugees are being failed at every stage. ""The speed in which people are processed and moved on gives women little chance to attend to their basic needs.

The Czech government wrote to Brussels arguing that compulsory quotas were illegal and that it could take the issue to the European court of justice in Luxembourg, while the anti-immigration Hungarian government brought in new laws authorising the army to use non-lethal force against refugees massing on its borders.  Related: Austrian shepherd who drives refugees across border to safety ""There are still a few problems to solve,"" said Asselborn. ""We still have 20 hours."" ""The terrain is still very uncertain,"" said a senior source from Luxembourg. ""We don't yet have agreement. It's going to be very, very difficult."" This week's fresh attempt to agree on a quota system comes amid the deepest divisions between western and eastern Europe since the former Soviet-bloc countries joined the EU a decade ago. At issue is the paltry figure of 66,000 refugees being shared across the EU after being moved from Italy and Greece. They have already agreed to share 40,000 and were to redistribute a further 120,000. But 54,000 of those were from Hungary, which passed a law on Monday allowing the army to use non-lethal force on migrants and whose hardline government wants no part of the scheme. Given that up to a million people are expected to enter Germany alone this year and that Frontex, the EU's border agency, says 500,000 are currently preparing to leave Turkey for the EU, the figures being fought over in Brussels are risible. But the numbers are not the real issue. The row is about power and sovereignty. In the end it seems that all countries will join in sharing refugees, with the exception of Britain, which has opted out of the scheme. The other two countries with opt-outs - Ireland and Denmark - have agreed to take part, leaving the UK isolated.  Related: The Guardian view on refugees and the EU: time to sort the leaders from the led | Editorial For the east Europeans, the vexed question is one of who takes the decisions: whether Brussels and Berlin set their quota or whether they decide themselves to take in refugees. They feel they are being bullied and blackmailed by the Germans, who have threatened to withhold EU funding for the recalcitrants. For the supporters of quotas, especially in the European commission, the numbers are also less important. For Brussels, the key factor is that the start of mandatory sharing would mark the first tentative steps towards common EU policies on refugees and set a precedent to be built on. Germany is the biggest and strongest backer of the proposed new regime, not least since it is a replica of the system practised in Germany. It has a well-functioning federalised scheme that spreads and funds the burden across the 16 German länder (or states), based on a formula that takes account of local wealth, unemployment rates and the population density of immigrants. In effect, the European commission is proposing to extend the German model to the EU. If there is no consensus on Tuesday, the pro-quotas camp could push the issue to a qualified majority vote, which they would comfortably win. But that could open up deep divisions and cause major political damage. It would mean forcing countries to take in people they don't want and send people to countries where they do not want to go, said an EU official, who believed a vote on such an incendiary issue would be counter-productive. The summit on Wednesday is to focus on how to keep people out rather than how to bring them in, while avoiding the mayhem of recent weeks in the Balkans and central Europe, where borders have been opening and closing on a daily basis in an atmosphere of panic and chaos. The summit will concentrate on ways of stemming the flow from Turkey and Libya and helping the transit countries of the Balkans - in effect, proposing to bribe neighbouring countries to keep the migrants from reaching the EU. Germany has been admired for its open-door policy on Syrian refugees. It is also being blamed for the mess because of unilateral decision-taking that has sown confusion and led to kneejerk reactions in the countries en route to Germany from the Balkans - Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. There is also bewilderment about what Germany's policy is.   Related: Croatia border clashes as country says it cannot take more refugees Since April, when the drowning of 400 migrants in the Mediterranean raised the alarm, EU governments have staged several emergency meetings in response to horrible events - such as the death of a toddler on a Turkish beach and the asphyxiation of 70 migrants in a sealed lorry in Austria. The governments have bickered and quarrelled, failing to agree on coherent policies. Only the European commission has delivered a semblance of a joined-up strategy, including the plan for mandatory refugee quotas. There is talk of beefing up Frontex. But so far, the 26 countries of the Schengen free-travel area have supplied only 64 extra personnel to the borders agency, seconded for six months. And, while reinforcing life-saving naval operations in the Mediterranean, the countries have also failed to redeem all their pledges of logistical support for the mission. There is lots of talk of funding capacities in Turkey and building ""reception centres"" or refugee camps in Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans. But senior diplomats say these discussions are sketchy and vague. The commissioner in charge, Dimitris Avramopoulos, has admitted that the target countries are reluctant to host the EU-proposed camps.",1

Your heroic effort has certainly been noticed around the world, in federal courts across the nation, and by the true measure of your success: on Saturday Night Live. At the very least, based on this brutally honest self-assessment, the new president's first address to Congress deserved an A+ for effort. The sheer effort required to start a speech condemning racist murders and anti-Semitic attacks was historic. After all, earlier in the day, the same president suggested all those bomb threats to Jewish community centers were the work of his political opponents ""to make others look bad"".

Bannon insisted that Trump's stump speeches were ""full of content"" and Tuesday's address to Congress was no less full of it. To grasp for some oratorical heights, Trump and his speechwriters imagined the 250th anniversary of the founding of the republic. Never mind that the auspicious anniversary falls outside the scope of the second term of a Trump presidency. Trump simply refused to accept a 250th year burdened by the mistakes of the past decades, when ""we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled"".  His solution: to spend trillions and trillions of dollars overseas on increased military spending.  Related: Trump suggests antisemitic threats may be politically motivated, official says Some people might say this is contradictory, but they don't see what Trump saw during his election: a moment in history that could not pass without mention or cliche. To underscore this point, he variously described 2016 as an earthquake, a rebellion, a protest, and a chorus.  ""Finally the chorus became an earthquake,"" he orated, ""and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first.""  All except the non-united citizens: those who voted for Hillary Clinton, in greater numbers than moved the earth for Trump. He described a world in which dead factories would come back to life, drug addiction would end, inner cities would spring into prosperity, and the nation would be paved with gleaming new roads. Seriously, they are going to gleam because of this promise: ""Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.""  This is the best promise of all. An A+ kind of promise, which we know to be true because this is the most principled and ethical government ever.  ""We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials, and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government,"" said the president who sounds like he lobbies for Vladimir Putin. If you have any doubt about this, you should ask the Trump Organization's ethics officer to check the president's tax returns, just to be sure everything is kosher.  Few of his critics understand what Trump so eloquently described as the way ""each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present"". Trump's loving care and attention to truth, liberty and justice shone throughout his lengthy explanation of his approach to immigration.  Soon, he promised, he will build a wall on the southern border, even before Congress has given him the money to do so. Right now, he assured us, he was deporting bad hombre criminals, as well as many who are just any kind of criminal. Already he was blocking the uncontrolled entry of so many Muslim foreigners, after so many Syrian refugees have wasted their green cards sitting in squalid camps on Greek islands. Trump will keep all his promises, including the ones he just made Tuesday to work for ""real and positive immigration reform"".  ""The time for small thinking is over,"" said this president of exceedingly large thinking. ""The time for trivial fights is behind us.""

The most prominent was his proposal to ban all Muslim immigration to the US, which remains on Trump's website even today. But this week, a key question before Trump's pending administration was whether it would implement a Muslim registry.  Concerns this week over a possible database of Muslims focused on a discussion between Trump and Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, for a potential cabinet position. Kobach was photographed on his way into the meeting with Trump on Monday carrying documents outlining plans requiring ""special registration"" of immigrants from certain ""high-risk"" countries, a method used in the past to create a database of mostly Muslims.   Related: Muslims in Trump's America: realities of Islamophobic presidency begin to sink in  Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also declined to explicitly rule out such a registry, even as he said there would be no database based on religion.  The lack of clarity has prompted many to wonder: is there any precedent for such a registry, and would it even work?   What has Trump said?  As a candidate, Trump did not specifically campaign on the need for a Muslim registry. But when Trump was asked, on multiple occasions, if he favored a broader Muslim registry, he both declined to rule it out while signaling potential support for the idea. Trump also called for a database for Syrian refugees coming to the US, and on 20 November was widely perceived as embracing a broader Muslim registry in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris.  When an MSNBC reporter asked if ""there should be a database or system that tracks Muslims in this country"", Trump responded: ""There should be a lot of systems. Beyond databases. I mean, we should have a lot of systems."" Pressed on whether his administration would implement a Muslim registry, Trump proceeded to say he ""absolutely"" would. Politifact suggests he may have been referring at this point to the border wall, as Trump had deviated to discussing his plan for the southern border when the reporter followed up. But he also said ""it would just be good management"" when the reporter asked again about creating a database of Muslims.  Since his victory in the presidential race, Trump's campaign has argued he never advocated for a Muslim registry nor will he. But Trump himself has yet to put an end to the discussion by rejecting the proposal outright, and his meeting with Kobach only further fanned the flames.  Has there ever been a Muslim registry?  The precedent cited by both proponents and opponents of a Muslim registry is the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, known as NSEERS, established after the September 11 attacks under President George W Bush. Kobach, who served in the Department of Justice at the time, was incidentally the program's chief architect. NSEERS was framed as an effort to focus not on religion, but on country of origin. But of the 25 countries on its list requiring ""special registration"", 24 were Muslim-majority (the other was North Korea), and Muslims and Arabs were disproportionately targeted.  Men from those countries over the age of 16 had to register upon entry to the US, as did those already in the country, at the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service. The process included fingerprinting, photographs and interrogation, as well as a designation to check in at regular intervals with immigration authorities.  More than 100,000 individuals were registered before the program's suspension in 2011, and at least 14,000 were deported - mostly for overstaying visas. Not a single terrorism charge was publicly reported from the database, which even Bush administration officials later conceded was not simply a failure in terms of intelligence gathering but also counterproductive for marginalizing Muslim communities at home and abroad. ""To my knowledge, not one actual terrorist was identified,"" James W Ziglar, a former INS commissioner, told the New York Times in 2004.  ""But what we did get was a lot of bad publicity, litigation and disruption in our relationships with immigrant communities and countries that we needed help from in the war on terror.""  How would a Trump administration register Muslims?  Trump has not called for blanket registration of all Muslims in the US or those seeking to immigrate from other countries. Doing so would not only be unconstitutional, but also impossible to implement. There is not a precise figure for how many Muslims currently live in the US, as the Census Bureau does not collect data based on religion. Estimates have ranged from 3-7 million Muslims in the US, but in any case they account for less than 1% of the country's adult population.  Related: Michigan Muslims face reality of Trump victory: 'I pray for our community' As of 2010, Muslims made up just under a quarter (23.2%) of the global population, with roughly 1.6 billion around the world, according to the Pew Research Center. Two of the three countries with the largest Muslim populations - Indonesia and India - are close US allies, as is Turkey, which has the eighth-largest Muslim population in the world.  Trump's campaign, both when discussing his proposed Muslim ban and a database of any kind, has suggested he would focus on countries perceived as ""high-risk"", following the phrasing of the Bush administration when setting up NSEERS.  The Muslim-majority countries in that program were: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.  Would there be a legal challenge?  It is unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of religion, and civil rights groups have already threatened to sue if a Trump administration proceeds with anything even resembling a Muslim registry.  Related: Muslims are terrified, but we won't be intimidated by Trump | Moustafa Bayoumi Omar Jadwat, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, told the Guardian the question before a court or in a legal challenge would be what a database was intended to do.

""I don't think they can un-ring that bell and try to pretend there's some other neutral reason for what they're doing, especially against the backdrop of NSEERS itself having been a total failure."" Jadwat added that the ACLU would sue ""if [the Trump administration] created a Muslim registry, whether it be by name or by even without naming it as such"". New York City would also sue the federal government if Trump required Muslims to register in a database, Mayor Bill De Blasio said this week in a speech that denounced several of Trump's proposals.

EU officials in Brussels said on Monday that economic migrants not deemed to have valid asylum claims were to be returned as soon as possible, while asylum seekers might be returned from 4 April onwards, unless they were able to prove they were at risk in Turkey. But the head of the UNHCR in Europe, Vincent Cochetel, said the latter deadline did not appear workable.  ""I am not sure 4 April is a realistic deadline to see the implementation of the deal,"" he told the Guardian. ""For those applying for asylum ... I don't see how it could be implemented on time."" The main problem, he said, would be getting specialist asylum case workers in place in time to hear individual cases.   EU leaders agreed with Ankara last week that most refugees and migrants who arrived on Greek shores after Saturday would be sent back to Turkey. But this requires building a functioning asylum system on the Greek islands in barely a fortnight.  Related: EU-Turkey deal to return refugees from Greece comes into force Under the deal, a small army of 4,000 staff, consisting of police officers, asylum cases officers, judges and interpreters, will be sent to the Greek islands to process refugee claims and returns. The first wave of personnel is expected to arrive next Monday, with the first ferries carrying asylum seekers to Turkey expected to set sail a week later. Although EU member states will provide more than half the staff, debt-ridden Athens faces a mammoth task in getting 1,500 staff in place at a time when public sector recruitment is frozen.  In Greece, confusion surrounded enforcement of the deal. Holding talks with visiting EU migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, questioned the efficacy of the deal if thousands of refugees continued to enter the country from Turkey. ""Unfortunately [on Sunday] there was a high number of arrivals, some 1,500,"" he said. ""If a reduction of flows does not happen, we won't be able to evacuate the islands successfully so that the deal can start to be implemented fully."" Greek government figures showed that by Monday, the official onset of spring, 50,411 refugees and migrants had crossed the Aegean with over 13,000 trapped in the squalid camp of Idomeni on the sealed Greek-Macedonian border. Acknowledging the teething problems, Avramopoulos accepted that the influx would not be reduced ""in a night"".  Related: Migrants in Turkey still sailing for Greece as new rules come in But he insisted that implementation was key to Europe's ability to curb the biggest movement of people into the continent since the second world war. ""We are at a crucial turning point,"" he told reporters. ""The management of the refugee crisis for Europe as a whole hinges on the outcome and success of this agreement.""  Greek government officials emphasised that much would depend on the 28-nation bloc following up on its promise to dispatch what Tsipras described as ""human resources"" to help deal with the crisis.  The Dutch economist, who led the EU's taskforce in Greece during the country's bailout negotiations, Maarten Verwey, has been appointed to take charge of coordinating action on the ground, in a sign the Greek government has ceded control of managing asylum and migration policy.  Getting the asylum system up and running on the Greek islands is vital for the EU, as claims of the deal's conformity with international law rest on the fact that each asylum seeker will have an individual hearing and right of appeal.  But the promise of individual hearings has not put the UNHCR's concerns to rest.  Cochtel said the agency had ""some concerns about the return of Afghans to Turkey"" because they faced the risk of refoulement, being returned to a warzone. Afghans and other non-Syrians in Turkey are less likely to gain refugee status than those fleeing Bashar al-Assad's war, he said. Turkey had passed ""a good asylum law"" in May 2014, Cochetel said, but ""in practice the law is not well implemented and it is just impossible to think that Turkey will fix those gaps in the coming days"". He urged asylum judges in Greece to be cautious and not to assume that Turkey was safe for everyone.  Although the agency thinks the EU-Turkey deal is just about on the right side of the law, staff were left fuming when the European commission gave the impression the UNHCR was working with the EU to return refugees and migrants to Turkey. In a briefing note published on Saturday, the commission said ""the UNHCR will be a key actor in the readmission [return] and resettlement processes"".   Related: Refugee crisis: What does the EU's deal with Turkey mean? This communique was ""a bit misleading"" and did ""not exactly reflect what will be our role"", Cochetel said, stressing the UNHCR would not be involved in returning people to Turkey.  The UNHCR has also stopped providing bus services for migrants on the islands of Lesbos and Chios, since reception centres were turned into places of detention, a decision Cochetel said was ""problematic"" and ""not our vocation"". Although the agency does not advocate that no one should be detained, it rejects a policy of mass detentions for failed asylum seekers and irregular migrants. Under EU law asylum, migrants who have been denied asylum and other can be held in detention centres until they are deported. Ketty Kehayioy, spokeswoman for the UN refugee agency in Athens, raised concerns the deal would be implemented without required safeguards: ""Greece doesn't have a system for addressing asylum claims in place,"" she said. ""There is a lot of confusion. We are trying to understand how this whole thing will be implemented."" Building an asylum system on the Greek islands in a fortnight Around 4,000 staff - asylum caseworkers, judges, interpreters and border guards - are being sent to the Greek islands to ensure that every single person claiming the right to remain in Europe will have an interview and the right to appeal.  More than half will be police and security staff to manage the high number of returns to Turkey. The first boats carrying Syrian refugees back to Turkey are expected to leave port from 4 April, but those not claiming asylum are expected to be returned even sooner. Around 2,500 of the total staff are to come from other EU countries and the remainder from Greece. So far 20 of the EU's 27 remaining countries (excluding Greece) have made pledges to send staff, including Germany and France, who will each send 300 asylum experts and police.

It was only the briefest of stopovers: they were on the first leg of a journey to take Hamlet to every country in the world. Ambassadors had been schmoozed, visas and flights booked, money raised (some money, at least). The plan was to visit nearly 200 nations in time for the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death two years later. What could possibly go wrong? According to the man who came up with the idea, former Globe artistic director Dominic Dromgoole, rather a lot. Severe food poisoning came close to ending things in Mexico City, and Wahhabist prohibitions on men and women sharing a stage nearly did for them in Saudi Arabia. Due to the unfolding Ebola crisis, a chunk of west Africa proved too risky. There were challenges closer to home, too, when the Globe came under fire for announcing they would perform in North Korea. Shakespeare, that canniest of courtiers, might have enjoyed the diplomatic irony that followed: Kim Jong-un 's regime then refused to allow them in. Part diary, part travelogue, part meditation on the play, Hamlet, Globe to Globe is Dromgoole's account of what he cheerfully admits was a ""daft"" idea carried out with courageous, Fortinbras-like efficiency. Barbados, Suriname, Ukraine, Papua New Guinea, Kazakhstan: the company played them all and 185 more countries, often with barely enough time to rig their spartan set and pack it in their flight cases again. Some performances left geopolitical shockwaves, notably a trip to the UN's Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan in 2015 to play for Syrian refugees, which generated headlines around the world. Elsewhere, it seems to have been as much as the troupe could do to muster a crowd. Dromgoole ruefully notes that a show in Wittenberg, the town of Hamlet's education, was ""rather disappointing"". Another in Gdansk in Poland - and I can testify to this, having been there that day - resulted in many spectators leaving at the interval. (Dromgoole blames teething troubles with the theatre.) For all its excitements, the journey must have been a slog, and the book has something of that feel, too. Dromgoole joined the travellers only intermittently, and his descriptions, while atmospheric, often have a scrambled, straight-off-the-plane quality, with every after-show drink or impromptu chat ransacked for significance. We get most of a chapter on the machinations of an elegantly mysterious stranger in Djibouti who claims to be the British consul but is apparently French (a kind of Polonius, though the point feels strained). A section on the Farc and Colombian politics is also lacking in bite. The book delivers sharp insights into a play Dromgoole has spent a lifetime turning over in his mind Dromgoole is at his best on home turf, roaming around the vastnesses of Shakespeare's longest script. There's good nitty-gritty on the practicalities of staging, and some battle-hardened textual insights. I liked his description of the ""eruptive energy and dislocated music"" of early punctuation (up there with David Mamet or Caryl Churchill, he thinks), likewise his doughty defence of the so-called ""bad"" 1603 first quarto, which although it contains such off-colour gems as ""to be or not to be, ay, there's the point"" almost certainly captures a version of the play actually staged in Shakespeare's lifetime. Dromgoole's own prose occasionally has an attack of the Osrics, as when he describes one soliloquy as ""an explosion of sewage, erupting on to the streets of himself from the gurgling catacombs beneath"" - an image that lingers for the ickiest of reasons. But equally often it delivers sharp insights into a play he has spent a lifetime turning over in his mind. An analysis of the hero's psychological troubles feels nakedly personal; and he astutely observes that Shakespeare finds for his sweet Prince a tone of ""troubled consciousness"" that doesn't quite exist anywhere else. Less appealing is his zeal for settling old scores. ""Time-servers"" at British Council HQ get it in the neck for suggesting that the project doesn't offer enough ""dialogue"". Amnesty is attacked for criticising the North Korea visit. (Did the Globe ask their views first? No detail is offered.) A BBC journalist dares to ask a question on the same topic, and is derided for her ""smug scepticism"". An encounter with critical academics in another BBC studio (Dromgoole candidly admits he turned up the worse for wear) drifts on for five wounded, self-justifying pages. Satisfying as these moments of drive-by payback might be for the author, it's tempting to offer some Gravedigger-like advice: if the hole is deep enough, stop digging. Strangely, too, for a book that spans the Shakespearean globe, there is conspicuously little about Shakespeare done in ways other than by the Globe's own players. If Dromgoole takes the opportunity to see work by other companies en route, he doesn't let on, and he betrays a lack of curiosity about how other cultures understand this most globally translated and reinterpreted playwright. The Belgian director Ivo van Hove, whose astonishing Dutch-language Roman tragedies cycle recently visited London for the second time, is gruffly praised as ""relentlessly experimental"", but there's a none-too-subtle hint that audiences in Amsterdam prefer the no-frills Globe approach. Most directors would probably keep stumm about not having seen Thomas Ostermeier 's ripped-up, retooled German Hamlet (2008), which - whatever one thinks of it - is probably the most widely influential live staging of recent times. For Dromgoole, who meets Ostermeier and engages in a ""cock-off"" over whose production has visited more countries, avoiding the show is apparently a point of pride. That Shakespeare might already inhabit these places in a multiplicity of languages and forms, is largely ignored There is no doubting their courage, but why are his actors visiting all these countries? As with so many questions in Hamlet, this one doesn't really find an answer. ""Why not?"" is a reply proffered near the end of the book, but Dromgoole's next suggestion, that the Globe was engaging in its own ""nuttily"" aggrandising version of the 60s space programme, seems more telling - figuring these ""actor-astronauts"" as heroic voyagers into deep, uncharted territory. That this territory might not be so uncharted, that Shakespeare might already inhabit these places in a multiplicity of languages and forms, is largely ignored. Likewise, Dromgoole scoffs at suggestions that sending a British company on a world tour with the British empire's favoured playwright might come across as a touch neocolonial - especially given they play in Jacobethan English, usually without surtitles, and don't collaborate with local companies. But then he fails to come up with a convincing reply, revealing almost nothing about how non-Anglophone audiences engaged with the text, or what kind of cross-cultural conversation the experiment provoked (I'd love to know). This is ""dialogue"" as actors and directors all too often understand the term: something to be handled by professionals while audiences stand obediently by. Perhaps the British Council had a point. No doubt saying all this places me squarely among the hand-wringers, cavillers and time-servers. I wasn't in Wittenberg, so can't report on why the audience was so disappointing there - but perhaps the Germans already have enough Hamlets of their own? · Andrew Dickson's Worlds Elsewhere: Journeys Around Shakespeare's Globe is published by Vintage.

2117,src_theguardian_raw4.docx,The Guardian,9/11/2015,1389 words,Roy Greenslade,Images of drowned boy made only a fleeting change to refugee reporting; Study of newspapers across Europe reveals that initial press sympathy after Alan Kurdi's death rapidly reverted to type within a week,Broadsheet,"Newspapers in western Europe became significantly more sympathetic towards migrants and refugees immediately after the publication of photographs of the lifeless body of Alan (aka Aylan) Kurdi on a Turkish beach. But within a week of the pictures of the three-year-old boy having been published most of the papers had reverted to their original editorial stance.  And, according to research carried out by the European Journalism Observatory (EJO) network, by the end of the month all were less positive towards migrants than at the beginning.* The finding emerged in a detailed analysis of the press coverage in eight countries of the flight of Syrian refugees: How European newspapers covered the migration crisis. (This posting is based on a report of the study by Caroline Lees).**  It revealed distinct national trends in how the story was reported; political bias in some newspapers that transcended national boundaries; and the fact that most papers in eastern Europe and the Baltic states did not publish the photographs and barely covered the story. Researchers looked at how three newspapers in each country - representing broadly left, right and tabloid newspapers - covered three pivotal events concerning migrants in September.  These events were the photographs of Alan Kurdi (2 September); the day Germany introduced border controls (13 September); and the EU summit aimed at agreeing a common European approach to the crisis (23 September).  Then they graded the coverage as positive (compassionate, sympathetic, humane), negative (describing migrants as economic or ""illegal"", possibly infiltrated by terrorists, violent, ""mobs"", being a ""drain on society"") or objective (neutral factual reporting).  Newspapers in Britain - the Guardian, Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail - in Germany, Italy and Portugal devoted considerable space to the crisis and covered it in more detail than elsewhere.  In Germany, Italy and Portugal positive humanitarian stories about migrants increased three-fold immediately after the photographs were published. In the UK the number of positive humanitarian stories across the three newspapers studied also increased, but were fewer (although I detected a genuine change of heart at the time ). But, in all four countries, the number of positive humanitarian stories had decreased by 12 September to nearly the level they had been before the Kurdi photographs.  This demonstrates, says the report, that the surge in sympathetic coverage after the photographs did not signify a long-term shift in media opinion, but appeared to be - as some analysts had suspected - a short-term emotional reaction to the boy's death. As for newspapers in eastern European and the Baltic, they devoted significantly less space to the crisis. Only three newspapers of the 12 studied in this group published the Kurdi images and some criticised Germany and the EU for being ""too emotional"" over the crisis. None of the Latvian papers in the study published the pictures or mentioned the story, apart from one negative comment about children being used as a propaganda tool. Only one Ukraine newspaper published the photographs.  In the British newspapers, the number of ""domestic positive"" articles (those urging the government to take in more refugees and lamenting that not enough was being done) increased from zero in the two days before the Kurdi photographs to seven in the two days after. But the situation reverted to only two positive stories one week later, and was back down to zero two weeks later.  Stories about the migrants as a domestic issue in Germany - the country that agreed to accept the highest number - were already overwhelmingly positive before the Kurdi photographs and remained so throughout September. However, by the end of the month, the number of positive articles had begun to decline in Germany.  Unsurprisingly, the study found that conservative newspapers across Europe were significantly more negative when covering the impact of migrants on their own countries. They were also more critical of the European Union's response to the crisis. In Italy, the right-leaning Il Giornale was particularly negative towards the migrants in a domestic context. The right-leaning UK titles, the Telegraph and Mail, in company with Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Czech Republic's Mlada fronta Dnes and Poland's Rzeczpospolita, also tended to be more negative in their coverage of the domestic consequences of the migration crisis and their government's handling of it.  Again unsurprisingly, left-leaning newspapers, such as Guardian in the UK, die Tageszeitung (taz) in Germany and La Repubblica in Italy carried more sympathetic, pro-refugee coverage in general. Analysts were surprised, however, by initial coverage in the German tabloid, Bild, which is often equated with the Sun in Britain.  Throughout September, despite a traditional editorial line that has stoked anti-migrant prejudice, it published a large number of sympathetic humanitarian stories.  Tina Bettels-Schwabbauer, editor of the EJO's German site, said this prompted scepticism from many in the media who wondered how long Bild's enthusiasm for migrants would last.  ""Their scepticism was justified,"" she noted ""By the beginning of October, Bild's headlines had reverted to reflect their more typical stance"" which ""could be one of the first hints that the tabloid is changing sides again."" The second key event - Germany's reintroduction of border controls - also provoked strongly negative reactions from some countries, but also divided opinion along political lines. And an analysis of EU-related stories in the UK revealed that its papers carried several negative articles about the EU's handling of the crisis after 13 September, and of the ability of its members to solve it.  On 11/12 September, the three UK titles ran a total of only two negative and two positive stories about the EU and its response to the crisis. But on 14/15 September, there were no positive stories; 12 were negative and only two were objective.  According to the study, coverage in the British press remained overwhelmingly negative towards the EU's handling of the crisis after this date until the end of the month.  Notably, say the researchers, the Guardian changed from generally positive to generally negative coverage of the EU after 13 September. Writing about ""disarray"" in the EU, one Guardian columnist acknowledged the crisis had ""played into the hands of the Eurosceptics"". (NB: this was an article by Hugo Dixon, who is a freelance contributor to the Guardian, and not a regular columnist). Elsewhere, there was a significant increase in negative stories about the EU in Poland and the Czech Republic after the 13 September introduction of border controls.  Czech papers, reflecting the impact of Germany's decision to reinstate controls at the Austrian border, remained overwhelmingly negative towards Angela Merkel and EU policies from the 13 September for the rest of the month.  German newspaper coverage remained positive towards the migrants even after introduction of the border controls but newspapers became more negative towards the EU after that date.  All German outlets published negative articles about how other EU countries were handling the crisis, their reluctance to collaborate and accommodate more migrants.  *Eight websites, all part of the EJO network, collaborated in the study. The researchers were Caroline Lees, England; Roman Hajek, Czech Republic; Tina Bettels-Schwabbauer and Anna Carina Zappe, Germany; Philip Di Salvo, Italy; Adam Szynol and Michal Ku s , Poland; Ana Pinto Martinho, Portugal; Liga Ozolina, Latvia; Halyna Budivska, Ukraine.

2131,src_theguardian_raw5.docx,The Guardian,18/9/2015,2874 words,Andrew Sparrow,"John McDonnell apologises profusely on Question Time for comments praising IRA - as it happened; Rolling coverage of tonight's BBC Question Time (#bbcqt), with John McDonnell, the new shadow chancellor, Alex Salmond, Liz Truss, Sandi Toksvig, and Tim Stanley, with comment and analysis",Broadsheet,"block-time published-time 12.38am BST   Summary and verdict  For the key news lines from tonight's Question Time, see 10.30pm and 11.35pm. But it is not just important what John McDonnell said; it is how he said it, and how he came across. Making McDonnell shadow chancellor has been Jeremy Corbyn's most controversial appointment, and the success or failure of the Corbyn project will depend what a lot on how well he can do. So what was he like? In many ways, pretty good. Softly-spoken, engaging (in the literal sense - he seemed to engage well with the questions he was asked) and straightforward, if you were to forget for a moment all the IRA stuff he probably dominated the programme. It helped that he did not sound anything like the wild Trot depicted in the media, and when he made the case that Corbynite policies on, for example, housing were not extreme, he was persuasive. It was also striking how much better he is at this than his boss. When Corbyn recorded a clip for the broadcasters on Wednesday saying he did not sing the national anthem because he was thinking about his parents, he sounded evasive and not especially credible. McDonnell made the story sound much more plausible. But did he manage to make his apology sound plausible? Judging by Twitter (see 11.21pm), only up to a point. His Thatcher apology partly took the form of a joke but, given that he was apologising for a joke, that seemed fair enough. His IRA apology came over as genuinely sincere, and even heartfelt. But while he was happy to say sorry for lauding the IRA, he certainly didn't shed the accusation that he was overly sympathetic to violent Republicanism. Corbyn faces the same problem too. Quite how much this will damage them politically remains to be seen. Those who feel most strongly about this are probably people unlikely to vote Labour anyway, but you don't have to be a Tory to feel a deep revulsion towards the IRA. Overall, McDonnell came over as someone who will do well at trying to sell the anti-austerity message to a public still sold on sound money economics. But getting the voters to swallow the Corbyn/McDonnell anti-imperialism agenda at the same time may be asking a bit much, and tonight's Question Time illustrated the full scale of the challenge. McDonnell made some progress in trying to persuade people that Labour is not now run by IRA apologists, but he certainly did not bury the issue for good. That's all from me. Thanks for the comments. block-time published-time 11.55pm BST  I posted the quotes from John McDonnell containing his two apologies earlier. (See 10.30pm.) Here are the other key quotes. McDonnell said that Jeremy Corbyn told him after the Battle of Britain service that he normally does sing the national anthem, but that this time he was lost in thought. I said afterwards 'why didn't you sing?' and he said 'actually I normally do', but it was quite a moving event and he was casting his mind back to the war...the national anthem isn't just for those who are monarchists, it's for everyone and it represents the whole country and that's why people sing it. He said that Labour under Corbyn would be happy to raise the top rate of income tax to just 50p in the pound. On income tax it isn't an issue for us. The Tories reduced it from fifty to forty-five and we'd like to just go back to the fifty. We think that's reasonable.

2155,src_theguardian_raw5.docx,The Guardian,11/3/2014,1526 words,"Simon Tisdall, theguardian.com",Inside a refugee camp in Jordan three years after the Syrian uprising began,Broadsheet,"ABSTRACT An estimated 1.2 million Syrians are living in Jordan, many in refugee camps, displaced - geographically and psychologically FULL TEXT The old man does not give his name. He does not say anything at all. Lying under a blanket on a thin mattress in the corner of a dark, prefabricated metal container that these days serves as home, he greets a visitor with a baleful stare. Then, slowly, he turns his face to the wall and pulls his red and black checked keffiyeh over his head. His misery, shame, anger and and isolation seem complete: he is beyond reach. But his tacit statement is both unmistakable and painfully eloquent. Once, not long ago in Syria, he - like so many others - had a family, a house, a job, friends, a neighbourhood, a purpose. He was a man in his own right. Life made sense. Now, inside the confines of the sprawling Zaatari refugee camp a few miles from the Syrian border in north-west Jordan, he is a number and a statistic. His life is a shadow of what it was. He appears wholly displaced - physically, geographically, socially and psychologically. Unlike the more than 140,000 Syrians who have died since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime began three years ago this week, he is still alive. But, for him at least, the rest is silence. In vivid contrast, Malak and Amjad, aged 27 and 29, and their two small children, Loci (aged two-and-a-half) and Sirin (20 days old), do not take their enforced exile lying down. They do not want their full names published for fear of reprisals against family members still in Syria. The couple came to Zaatari camp from a village near Daraa, the city where the rebellion ignited on March 15 2011 after the arrest and mistreatment of 15 local schoolboys for spraying anti-regime graffiti. Here they have joined about 110,000 other refugees, most from the same area south of Damascus. As Syria's uprising-turned-civil-war enters its fourth year, there is little sign of an end to the suffering that has forced 2.5 million people to flee, principally to Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt. The conflict has internally displaced a further 6.5 million, and left 9.3 million in need of humanitarian assistance, according to UN figures. More than 180,000 people have simply disappeared, says the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Overall, the total refugee outflow rose more than four-fold in 2013. ""At the beginning there were random attacks and this could be tolerated,"" Amjad said. ""Then [the regime forces] started aerial bombing. The buildings were destroyed. Army officers were coming into the village and we were worried for the women. So we decided to leave, though the men mostly stayed behind. It took four days to come across the border, travelling by night. If the army had found us they would have killed us."" ""We want to go back but it is very difficult,"" Malak, Amjad's wife, said. ""There's nothing left, our neighbours, our families are not there any more. Every day we hear the names of someone who has died or been abducted. My two brothers, my cousin, my uncle all disappeared and we have not heard from them. Another uncle and cousin were killed. ""All the people in Daraa are against the regime ... The Americans should have helped our country from the beginning because this is a bloody regime. Everybody is under the direction of the Americans, so nothing happens until America does something ... We hope to God we shall return. We don't want to be in the same situation as the Palestinians."" Jordan, in particular, is creaking under the strain as the Geneva peace talks remain at stalemate and the focus of the fighting inside Syria appears to shift towards a southern front, along the two countries' shared border. The government estimates 1.2 million Syrians are now living in Jordan, whose total non-Syrian population is just over 6 million. New arrivals rose last week to about 1,000 people daily, a doubling since the beginning of the year, said Carlos Afonso of the European Commission's humanitarian office (ECHO) in Amman. Eighty per cent of Syrians in Jordan live in the community rather than in the four camps currently in use. Such is the pressure on resources, a newly constructed camp, at Azraq, with capacity for 100,000-plus, is due to open soon. ""Tensions between Jordanians and Syrians are rising,"" said Waddah al-Hmoud, a senior Jordanian official responsible the security of the refugee camps. ""It is not too bad now but we are afraid it will come due to the pressure on services."" Prices and rents had skyrocketed since the Syrian influx began, and there was increased competition for jobs. ""We are looking to the international community to help us. We need long-term support. It will take at least five years to get them back even after the war has ended,"" he said. Despite border closures and tightened security, increased numbers of refugees were also heading for Jordan from central and northern parts of Syria because of increased instability and insecurity in Lebanon and Iraq, particularly Anbar province, and because of heavy militarisation along the Turkish border, said Aoife McDonnell of UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency. Another growing concern was malnutrition and disease. ""More and more refugees are reporting there is just no food to be had. And this is happening in Syria, which was bread-basket of the region. Their physical appearance when they come in is very weak and deteriorating,"" she said. An outbreak of polio inside Syria was also worrying, McDonnell said. It had come despite a UN-led, $39m multi-country vaccination campaign targeting 23 million children and increased funding for related water and sanitation projects inside Syria. Humanitarian access remains very limited, notwithstanding February's unanimous UN security council resolution on the issue. The international response to Syria has been almost unprecedented in cash terms, with the EU and member states such as Britain having committed (EURO)2.6bn (£2.2bn) so far. Zaatari camp alone costs $500,000 a day to run, according to ECHO. But it is clear much more is needed. Joanna Wronecka, the EU's ambassador to Jordan, said EU aid to the kingdom had doubled to (EURO)226m a year and was likely to double again. The US had also increased assistance, including $1bn in new loan guarantees. ""Jordan needs more money and more help. They are planning economic reforms with the IMF and they have agreed to end subsidies on food and bread and fuel and are looking to implement it,"" Wronecka said. But such changes might contribute to rising inter-communal tensions in the short term, she added. Despite these problems, Kilian Kleinschmidt, manager of the UN's Zaatari camp, said the independent, highly entrepreneurial outlook of the Syrian refugees provided an encouraging pointer for the future. After a period in 2012-13 when UN and NGO workers were ""shit-scared"" to enter parts of the camp, due to frequent riots, stonings, and gang attacks, the situation had been transformed by empowering refugees to take charge of their lives. ""All the people here have seen something horrible. They have been hiding and running, they have experienced killing and torture, spying and betrayal. These people don't trust anybody any more. Plus they are traditionally traders and smugglers. They are anti-government. They don't like authority,"" he said. So rather than emphasising physical control and keeping resentful recipients dependent on food and other handouts, UN workers had begun distributing vouchers, which enabled the refugees to decide to buy what they wanted. More cost-effective, direct cash assistance was now being extended by the use of ATM machines, backed by improved registration and identification of refugees using iris recognition isometric technology, he said. ""We now have 2,500 shops in the camp. We even have supermarkets. It costs $5,000 to open a shop at a prime location on the main street, which we call the Champs Elysées,"" Kleinschmidt said. ""We've put in better water and better roads. We've appointed 'street leaders' and licensed 'electricity ministers'. Before they were stealing the electricity. Now they are in charge of it."" Other key measures included the expansion of the camp's school system, for both boys and girls, using Jordanian and Syrian teachers; creating more employment opportunities for refugees; and seeking private sector partnerships and investment. Companies such as Google and universities and colleges such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology were interested in camp projects, he said. Uefa had set up a football club and overseen a tournament that attracted 500 children. As a result, the incidence of unrest, exploitation, child labour and sexual violence in the camp had greatly reduced, Kleinschmidt said. The sudden implosion of Syria's relatively sophisticated society had produced ""the most shocking crisis in the world"", he said. But at Zaatari, at least, after the shattering dislocation and disintegration of the past three years, ""we are retraining communities to look after each other"". And the Syrians, he said, were retraining UN agencies on how to do humanitarian assistance differently and better.",1

2161,src_theguardian_raw5.docx,The Guardian,9/12/2016,1453 words,Patrick Kingsley in Thessaloniki,"Help Refugees: 'We will never abandon them'; The grassroots aid group working to move babies, children and their families out of freezing conditions in Greek refugee camps· Click here to donate to our appeal",Broadsheet,"""Please let me know if there's anything you can do for this woman,"" says the voice in the Whatsapp recording. ""She's about to give birth any day, she's living in a tent, and the conditions are awful."" Driving through northern Greece on a recent December night, a pair of volunteers from the grassroots aid group Help Refugees have just received this SOS from another aid worker. It is 7.32pm, and a young Afghan refugee is about to go into labour at one of Greece's worst refugee camps. It is a few dozen tents on a remote and windswept hillside - but the government and the UN refugee agency can't move her anywhere better. Can Help Refugees? As the temperature drops to 3C, the group's network whirs into action. A call goes out to Filoxenia, a housing project funded by Help Refugees, to see if it can take in the pregnant woman. Behind the wheel in the car, Crystallynn Steed Brown says if the worst comes to the worst, she will put up the family at her flat in Thessaloniki. But can they get to the woman in time? It is a typical night for Help Refugees, one of three beneficiaries of the Guardian's Christmas charity appeal. The group is one of the unsung heroes of the European refugee crisis, a young grassroots collective that has tried to create a more dynamic form of aid in Calais and Greece, where even seasoned aid workers admit their traditional models have failed. ""Some of the bigger NGOs are starting to realise how they can utilise us because of our flexibility,"" says Brown, as she drives through the night. ""The bigger the organisation, the more they get caught up in the bureaucracy - and so they often reach out to us to see if there's anything we can do."" Help Refugees was founded in the late summer of 2015, after a group of friends decided to send a van of donations to Calais; it soon became one of the main suppliers of aid to northern France. With Calais now disbanded, the charity's main focus has shifted to Greece, where around 50,000 refugees - 40% of them children - have been stranded in squalid and degrading camps since a shift in European migration policy in March.  The EU, major NGOs and the Greek government have collectively failed to provide adequate conditions. Help Refugees is attempting to fill in the gaps, funding more than 20 grassroots groups that are working to alleviate the situation. Through its partners, Help Refugees provides food, infant care, safe spaces, building materials, building work and water infrastructure in dozens of camps; it funds rescue boats at sea - and organises housing for particularly vulnerable refugees. And it's this that sends Brown hurtling in her Peugeot hatchback through Thessaloniki. By now, another aid worker has managed to bring the pregnant Afghan to a local hospital, and her son, Ali, has become the world's youngest refugee. But if Help Refugees can't intervene in time, there is a danger that both mother and child will be out in the snow again within a few days.  Brown arrives after visiting hours are over, and is initially denied entry. But after grasping the desperate nature of the situation, the nurses relent, and Brown calmly explains to the mother what Help Refugees can do for her. ""We will find you a place,"" she says through a translator, also called Ali. ""And if we can't find you a place, you'll sleep in my house."" Brown leaves the hospital relieved to have made contact. But back in the car, her mood is more subdued. ""I try not to be too emotional in this work,"" says Brown, a former ambulance worker from Idaho. ""But it's pretty messed up when you stop and think that I just held a brand new baby in my arms. And if we didn't step in and do something about it, that baby is supposed to move back into a tent in two days in freezing conditions.""  Related: From war in Syria to a Turkish sweatshop for child refugees A visit to Oreokastro, a camp on the other side of Thessaloniki, hints at how dismal that would be. After passing the spot where Brown treated a refugee who tried to kill himself this summer, and another where a car recently ran over a Syrian child and his mother, we meet a Syrian father cradling his 10-day-old daughter. In the depths of winter, the newborn has been sent to live in a tent at this former cigarette factory. There is no electricity, and therefore no heating. A warmer tent has been erected for young mothers, but refugees say it has never been opened. All of which leaves the young father fearing for his daughter. ""Children are dying from the cold,"" says Abdulhalim al-Matlaq, a builder who fled the advance of Isis in Deir Ezzor, eastern Syria. ""There's no heating. No money. It's just garbage."" Matlaq and his extended family escaped Deir Ezzor together last winter, and all 42 shared the same inflatable boat to Greece in February. They now occupy one long row of tents at Oreokastro, wondering if they will ever get to leave. They hoped to reach Germany, but the humanitarian corridor that once funnelled hundreds of thousands of Syrians through the Balkans closed in March. And in the months since, they have not been granted asylum elsewhere in Europe, due to the failure of the EU relocation scheme. This limbo has been particularly traumatic for their children, who are among hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees with no access to school across Europe and the Middle East. Yamamah, Matlaq's cheery 11-year-old niece, says the camp is too dangerous for her siblings to visit the toilet alone at night. To pass the time, they watch YouTube videos on her father's phone until they get tired. ""We're wasting our lives,"" says Yamamah. Her father, minibus driver Abdulrazzaq, agrees: ""It's not even limbo, it's five times worse than limbo. We've been here for 10 months, and it's all a mystery. We don't know if we're going to another country, if our kids are going to get to study again, or have a future."" His brother Abdulhalim has more basic concerns for his own child; he fears the camp is simply too cold. It is this kind of challenge that Help Refugees is trying to alleviate where it can. A few miles away, in another gloomy former warehouse, the group provides crucial funding to Nurture Project International (NPI), a small charity that gives pre- and post-natal support to Kurdish mothers at the Kalochori camp.  When we arrive, one nurse is teaching a Kurdish mother to wash her baby. A second nurse helps a 17-year-old refugee send breast milk to her premature daughter, who is still in hospital.  ""I never thought I'd have my first child in a place like this - it's too cold here for a baby,"" says Sonya, the young mother. ""If NPI weren't here, I'd be in a really bad situation."" The nurse, or international board certified lactation consultant, beams with affection. But in private, the tragedy of the situation looms larger. The conditions simply do not conform to western standards, says Fiona Lang-Sharpe. ""You let go of many of the things that you know or you've learnt, because you can't go and buy things that you have at home,"" she says, turning slightly emotional at the thought. ""We will not leave them and we will not abandon them.""  Related: 'Prisoners of Europe': the everyday humiliation of refugees stuck in Greece Ultimately, Help Refugees doesn't just want to make the camps better, it wants refugees to leave the camps entirely. A glimpse of this vision can be found at a block of flats in another remote suburb of Thessaloniki. Most of the buildings here were never inhabited, having been built when the financial crisis first hit Greece in 2008. But one of them has just been occupied by Filoxenia to provide refugees with a warm flat to live in.  Run by Samantha and Theo Nelson, former car dealers from Totnes, Devon, the building houses eight families in their own flats, and will soon welcome two more. After being cooped up in camps for months, the 54 residents can finally live in a greater degree of dignity. ""There's quiet here, there's privacy, and this is your house,"" says Bozan Ibo, a Syrian Kurd whose family was the first to move into Filoxenia six weeks ago. ""You have your own key. It's a normal life like it was in Syria."" His wife, Mezgin, smiles in agreement. They have a fruit bowl on the kitchen table, and a washing machine - two luxuries they haven't experienced for months.  ""When I came here, I don't how to describe how I felt,"" says Mezgin. ""When I think about it I almost cry!"" Mezgin thanks the Nelsons, who in turn thank Help Refugees for making the project happen. ""Help Refugees helps with everything really,"" says Samantha Nelson. ""There's their financial support, and also their support in general. They really understand what we're trying to do.""  · Click here to donate to our appeal ",1

2190,src_theguardian_raw5.docx,The Guardian,13/4/2016,1508 words,Karen McVeigh and Mona Mahmood,"Calais's youths: the unaccompanied minors left in political limbo; There are roughly 150 lone children in the Jungle with relatives in the UK, yet there is a lengthly and complex process between them and a potential reunion",Broadsheet,"A Labour peer who was saved from the Nazis as a child refugee and brought to Britain in the 1930s, has voiced fears over the number of unaccompanied children who have vanished from a camp outside Calais. Speaking just days after it emerged British police stepped in to rescue a seven-year-old Afghan boy who had stowed in a lorry from the French port, after he sent a text he was suffocating, Alf Dubs has called on the prime minister to take urgent action to provide a safe passage for child refugees. Lord Dubs said: ""It is becoming a difficult and dangerous situation for these children and more and more crucial that they are found a place of safety. They are disappearing in increasing numbers in Calais and elsewhere. And that is very disturbing. These children are in danger of being recruited by traffickers or forced into prostitution."" A third of the 420 unaccompanied minors in the Calais camp have gone missing since the French authorities demolished the southern section of the Jungle last month, according to a census by Help Refugees, a grassroots charity. In January, Europol warned 10,000 vulnerable children had vanished after arriving in Europe over the past two years. On Tuesday, Germany said almost 6,000 refugee children had been reported missing last year. Last month, the government was defeated in the House of Lords over Dubs' amendment to the immigration bill, to allow 3,000 child refugees travelling alone in Europe into Britain. David Cameron opposes the amendment - saying that Britain, which has pledged to take 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020, was concentrating its efforts on helping refugees before they reach Europe.  Related: Syrian refugee children deserve the same welcome I was given in 1939 | Alf Dubs The peer, who arrived in the UK on the Kindertransport, which helped 10,000 children escape the Nazis during the second world war, said he hopes the amendment will also pass in the Commons when it is debated.  He said: ""The PM is pretty adamant that he won't take people from Europe. But the safety, security and well-being of these children is more important than the theoretical argument that it will have a magnet effect on others.  ""Three thousand is a small number. It is not asking much to give them a place of safety."" Priority should be given to the 150 or so lone children in Calais with relatives in the UK, he said. On a visit to the Calais camp last month, the Guardian caught a glimpse of the chaos, uncertainty and squalor experienced by vulnerable children there - and the dearth of official assistance or urgency over their situation. Teenagers Marwan and Tarek, from the same neighbourhood in Dara'a, where the Syrian uprising began, separately fled the conflict that killed some family members and scattered others. They each arrived alone in the camp, hoping it would bring them closer to their families in Britain. Instead, they found an edgy staging post full of desperate migrants and refugees of many nationalities, that operates under its own rules. There is little protection for traumatised, unaccompanied minors, let alone official legal advice that may offer alternatives to falling prey to traffickers.  ""When I got to Calais, I was so happy"" said Tarek, 15, speaking via a translator. ""I thought, 'I'm close to my uncle, in London, I will see him soon'. But when I got here, it was not like I expected. It is hard. I'm scared. It's cold and I'm hungry."" Tarek, who also has a brother in the UK, has not heard from his parents for three months; he doesn't know whether they are alive or dead. ""I can't reach them,"" he said. ""I don't know what happened to them. I think about it all the time."" The pair, fearful of bullying by older men, quickly became inseparable and seldom ventured out of their rat-infested wooden shelter without the other. At 17, Marwan is at least a foot taller than his friend, more sure of himself, with a teenage boy's bravado. But he too admits he is afraid here, after a relative was attacked and robbed. He does not understand why his mother, who has refugee status in Britain and visited him in the camp in January, could not take him with her. ""I thought she was coming to take me,"" said Marwan. ""She said, 'No, I'm just coming to see you. I can't take you'. I got mad. I'm disappointed. It's so miserable. I can't stay here anymore."" When his mother calls, he says, he refuses to talk to her, blaming her in part for his predicament. ""Since the day, she left I feel I am traumatised,"" said Marwan. ""I am close to my mother and I miss my little brother all the time."" The teenagers, among 150 lone minors in the Jungle with family members in the UK, have a legal right to have their asylum claims assessed in Britain under the European asylum rule known as Dublin III. The 150 are mostly Syrians, many of whom are orphans, although there are also children from Iraq, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Kuwaiti Badoons. Almost all have at least one nuclear family member missing or dead and some all of them. Yet, so far, only 15 have been allowed into Britain, after three Syrian boys became the first from the Calais camp to be granted lawful safe passage under Dublin III in March. Lawyers, charities, refugee and medical groups argue that this process remains too lengthy and too complex. It can take up to nine months for the French authorities to issue a ""take charge"" request to the UK to take over an asylum claim, and a further wait for the Home Office to make a decision and issue travel documents. Agnès Lerolle, a lawyer with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said French authorities are not doing enough to help the children out of the camp and into safety. ""We are shocked there are so many minors here"" said Lerolle. ""The rules exist for re-unification of minors for asylum. But they are not practical and they are not working. A new solution should be made in the case of minors. I've discussed this with the prefecture, with the [France terre d'asile, a French child protection agency]. They all say they are concerned. But the children are still here. These kids seem tough. But they are very fragile."" Since the Guardian spoke to Tarek and Marwan in March, we learned that Tarek is now in London. In a phone call, from a camp for lone child refugees, he said: ""I am so glad to be here. They will put me in a centre to learn English and soon I will live with my brother."" He was sad and worried at having to leave his friend behind. Meanwhile, in Middlesborough, where Marwan's mother, Sara, lives in a two-bedroom flat with her baby daughter, she is desperately worried about her son. ""It is clear he is in a very bad situation,"" said Sara. ""He has a temper and I'm worried he will get into a fight with a bigger man. It is hard for him to even get a meal, because there are older men who will say, no, I am first, you are later. It is dirty and it is cold, he can't even have a shower. ""Whenever I call him, he starts to cry. It's so hard."" Through tears, Sara said she first applied to have Marwan join her in June 2015, when he was in Turkey with her husband and youngest son, who is four. She has since applied again, but it has so far been refused due to errors in her form. ""I feel so bad, I am like a mad woman, crying in the street all the time,"" she said. ""I want my sons, I miss them I can't cope without them. I feel helpless."" Lawyers working for Citizens UK say they will explore all legal avenues to reunite Marwan and the remaining children in Calais with their families in the UK.  Roopa Tanna, a lawyer from Islington Law Centre, said: ""As far as Marwan is concerned, his mum has refugee status and she has a right to family reunion with her spouse and her children. It seems so simple. But it isn't.""  At the camp, Marwan said he was becoming increasingly frustrated by his situation and plans to try to travel to Turkey if he dos not get to Britain. ""I'm dreaming of going back, to have my childhood back, in Syria,"" he declared. ""Fuck England. Fuck Europe."" Elizabeth Hoffman, a psychiatrist with MSF, has seen an increase in trauma, aggression and erratic and violent behaviour among migrants at Calais following the camp's partial demolition. She estimates that at least one in 10 teenagers self-harm. ""It's tough,"" said Hoffman. ""We haven't done a scientific study but anecdotally, it could be as many as 10%.""  When the Guardian asked the Home Office what it was doing to speed up reunification of unaccompanied minors in Calais, immigrations minister, James Brokenshire said: ""The UK and France are working closely together to ensure that children in France who have a right to be reunited with family in the UK are identified and supported through the asylum and family reunification process. ""To improve the operation of the Dublin Regulation between our two countries, in particular to assist in the handling of family reunification cases, we have set up a standing official level contact group and sent an asylum expert to France to work with the French interior ministry.""

2230,src_theguardian_raw5.docx,The Guardian,26/2/2016,2586 words,Tom Stevens,"'We are unwilling to accept the breaking of our constitution'; In Poland, fresh anti-government marches are planned this weekend. We asked people for their views on the current mood and the challenges that lie ahead",Broadsheet,"On Saturday 27 February the Committee for the Defence of Democracy (KOD) are planning a ""We, The People"" march in Warsaw. The protest movement was formed in the wake of the Polish parliamentary elections in October 2015, when the rightwing Law and Justice (PiS) party became the first party in post-communist Poland to control an absolute majority of the seats in the Polish parliament and the presidency at the same time.  KOD has taken issue with a number of recent PiS initiatives, with the government recently passing bills curtailing the independence of the judiciary, media and civil service. Many protesters believe the bills are a threat to Polish democracy. While recent decisions in parliament have caused alarm, there are also other issues facing Polish citizens. There's a real concern about the country's education system, the cost of living, the derogatory treatment of minority groups and the rise of youth movements siding with the far-right. ' The youth of the country is very rightwing and nationalistic'  Marcin Szymaniak has lived in Warsaw all his life. Having worked many years as a news reporter for Zycie Warszawy and the rightwing pro-Law and Justice paper Rzeczpospolita, he now writes for history magazines and actively takes part in the KOD demonstrations. He is frustrated about the protests not having had the desired effect so far.  ""Participants of anti-government demonstrations are mainly people from the larger cities, with a higher social and economic status then the average Polish citizen. Because of this I think the KOD demonstrations have been ineffective. Very few working class and young people are taking part. Young Poles are currently very rightwing and nationalistic.""   Related: The conspiracy theorists who have taken over Poland | Christian Davies Marcin says it's hard to avoid the hysteria in the Polish rightwing media about immigration. ""PiS is perceived by its voters as the last barrier against the 'Islamisation' of Poland. Under the previous government Poland accepted to host 7,000 Syrian refugees. I don't know what the PiS government plans on doing with that agreement. If they accept this decision, they could be easily attacked by the other far-right parties in parliament, like Kukiz'15. They are proposing a referendum on a complete immigration ban."" Two of the major issues for people living in Poland are the low wages and job security. ""A lot of Polish workers are on 'trash job contracts',"" he says. ""These are temporary jobs with no benefits or social security. Unfortunately, previous governments have been motivated by a neo-liberal ideology, turning a blind eye to some employers' practices. Trade unions don't exist in smaller Polish businesses, which means there's no pressure from workers to change the current situation.""  A lot has been made recently about a new government scheme offering families an extra 500 zloty a month (about £90) for their second and every next child. Marcin explains the reasoning behind this scheme, and its possible flaws. ""PiS is very Catholic and closely linked to the church. They are entirely against abortion and contraception, and would ideally like to ban both. But the new 500-zloty scheme is flawed. A millionaire with two children will get this benefit, while a single mother with one child will get nothing. The government says it's not a social care programme but a family support scheme. It's obvious they want to support the old style Catholic family model of a working man, a stay-at-home wife and a large amount of children."" 'Their strong religious motivations mean minorities and the LGBT community are dismissed in a derogatory way'  Selia has also actively taken part in KOD demonstrations. She lives in the central Polish city of Kalisz, and recalls the atmosphere of a recent march she attended in Lódz. ""It was very civil and easygoing. There were no hateful slogans. Everyone I met was simply unwilling to accept PiS breaking the constitution. The main problem is not the legislations themselves, but the way they were passed.""  Selia says that when the previous government, Civic Platform (PO), was in power between 2007 and 2015, things were far from perfect, but she is concerned about how PiS is now marginalising minority groups in Poland. ""The main enemy of PiS are supporters of 'gender ideology'. Basically everyone who is not living in a structured conservative family. The government is not a huge fan of equal rights, and I'm also worried about its association with radical youth organisations like ONR or Mlodziez Wszechpolska. These groups despise anyone who is different to them: immigrants, non-Catholics, liberals, the LGBT community and KOD protesters. I'm afraid because I think that's how wars start.""  Hannah also strongly dislikes the way PiS is marginalising vulnerable minorities and the LGBT community. She recently witnessed the KOD demonstrations in the Sródmiescie district of Warsaw. ""The Law and Justice party have won over a majority of voters by promising extra child benefits, free pre-school education and a universal healthcare system. But their strong religious motivations mean vulnerable groups in society and the LGBT community are dismissed in a derogatory way. They don't want to legally recognise homosexuality and are against IVF treatment. They're even calling for doctors who are involved with IVF to be imprisoned."" Hannah and her partner began IVF treatment themselves last November, when Civic Platform had just been voted out of power. Since then they feel the process has become very stressful. ""When we started the treatment, the clinic we went to was very busy. Returning in January, at around the same time state-funded IVF cycles were stopped, the clinic was almost empty. Many couples were relying solely on state-funded IVF. This will damage Poland in the long run as the country's birth rate is one of the lowest in Europe. We now have to attend official offices in the city to sign numerous documents stating that we are using IVF and that we are legally the parents. We feel we are being singled out."" Having already gone through two IVF cycles, the first unsuccessful and the second ending in a miscarriage, Hannah and her partner are hoping it's third time lucky. ""We're going to try again this April or May and fingers crossed, we get a much wanted baby.""  Related: Bernie Sanders' ancestral home in Poland grapples with painful history 'Most people in Poland are not familiar with their legal rights' Working as a business lawyer just outside Warsaw, Katarzyna finds the government's paralysis of the country's constitutional tribunal terrifying. ""It's the only body that can stop authorities from passing legislation that breaches the constitution. The changes that PiS have made mean people are left without the necessary protection provided by Poland's laws. Police and other agencies can gather informations about citizens' internet activity without any court order. Most people are not familiar with their legal rights. Eighty per cent of the population don't know that they can appeal a court judgement. I'm afraid that the average citizen will only notice a difference when they are faced with it personally.""  Despite her fears about the government's recent actions in parliament, Katarzyna says living standards in Poland have improved in the last couple of decades. ""Low salaries are still a problem, and some important professions are still being undervalued. But I believe Poland is still a developing country. When Poland became a democratic country, and implemented capitalism as its economic system 26 years ago, our debt was huge. The infrastructure was outdated, our agriculture was inefficient and most industries were overstaffed. Our standard of living was never going to match western standards after only 12 years of EU membership. The 'older' EU countries built their economies over a much longer time. Things have improved since the nineties, but it's obvious that more needs to be done.""  Katarzyna feels there is room for improvement in the education sector. ""As a mother of a primary school pupil, I have to say that the standard of teaching isn't very impressive. Maybe this is a reflection on poor wages and employment conditions.""  Artur lives in the town of Jelenia Gora near the south-west city of Legnica, and he echoes the concerns regarding Poland's education system. ""I believe Poland needed fundamental change. But there is plenty for PiS to do to improve living conditions for Polish citizens. Teaching is the most undervalued profession in Poland, all the way up to higher education. There isn't a single Polish university in the top 300 of any serious higher education list. This is due to mismanagement and a reluctance to accept organisational improvements which is endangering bright young people's further education and careers. A lot of Poland's institutions, mechanisms, media and people of influence need to change."" 'The real problem facing Poland is the cost of living'  Julian Gilbert has lived in Poland for the last 20 years and owns a firm teaching business English to organisations. He too has a child of primary school age, but is much more complimentary regarding the Polish education system. ""My eldest son, Alex, is eight and I try to compare my friends' experiences in the UK with here. Overall I think schools here are better, both academically and in terms of discipline. One big difference which might surprise people in the UK is that private schools are considered in Poland to be much worse than state schools. Here private schools are considered places, if you have enough money, you send your child if he or she isn't brilliant academically.""  Julian is originally from Southport but has settled in Gdynia with his Polish wife Kamilla and their two sons. He follows the developments in parliament with interest, but fears that the issue concerning most citizens is being overshadowed by other matters. ""There is currently too much emphasis on issues like immigration, religion and historical events. The real problem Poland is facing is the cost of living. The prices of things like property are extremely high, and most people's wages are simply too low to be able to afford them. Just 10 years ago property prices were within reach for average paid workers, but that isn't the case any more. Public sector workers are badly paid here; state school teachers, nurses, firemen and police. Pensions are also scandalously low. Even people with relatively good jobs find it hard to get by in Poland."" While the city of Gdynia is generally well-off, Julian points out that there are big differences between the country's regions. ""Gdynia is a maritime city. The ferries to Sweden depart from here and that brings work and money into the region. Generally the eastern parts of Poland are poorer. And like most countries there's a massive difference between the capital Warsaw and the rest of Poland."" Despite these demographical gaps, Julian believes Poland is catching up with the older EU countries' economies. ""One of my clients in Gdynia is an IT firm that has become so successful it recently opened a branch in Silicon Valley. The young Polish guys who own it now have US workers in their employment."" ' Wages in Poland are completely inaccurate compared to the personal economical freedom enjoyed by other Europeans'  Thomas Piatek 's family live in a small southern Poland town near Oswiecim ( Auschwitz ). While he does not support the KOD protests, he too is concerned about the cost of living, and particularly feels the issue of state pensions needs to be addressed. He says: ""Jobs and wages in Poland are completely inaccurate compared to the personal economical freedom enjoyed by other Europeans. One reason being that Polish labour is still an attractive workforce for foreign investors who pay less money. Another reason is the current weak Polish zloty. Economical migration from Poland is still large. The largest and most underpaid sector is still healthcare. Doctors and nurses take weekend jobs in hospitals elsewhere in Europe, and earn the same amount of money they would have made working in Poland for a month."" Pensioners in Poland seem to have been neglected by all previous governments, and are still seen as the biggest losers of the economic transformation that began 26 years ago. ""Pensions are appalling,"" says Thomas. ""My mother who worked under communist rule for 30 years receives just 450 zloty per month [£80]."" Despite these concerns he does not believe that PiS is threatening Poland's democracy with the new legislations passed in parliament. ""The new legislations balance out the judicial part of government after the previous government Civic Platform [party] staffed it with their supporters. The Law and Justice party are simply reversing the original unconstitutional process, reinstating the balance and bringing back the democratic process."" Thomas also suggests PiS have plans for Poland's future in the EU. ""PiS is for Poland's continued membership, but they want to level the field in terms of access to Polish labour and industrial infrastructure. They believe foreign companies should pay their fair share of the profits to the national treasury, and give something back to the country where they are becoming successful in business. This issue is not getting the attention it deserves."" 'Presenting their own truth and possessing genes of betrayal' One of the protesters' primary concerns is the apparent curtailing of Polish media by the current government. Warsaw resident Zbigniew Janik argues that taking over public media is not a new practice for a new Polish government. ""This has become common practice in Poland after a new government is elected. The public broadcasting corporation Telewizja Polska has a large reach, therefore they also have the capacity to shape opinions. For this reason it's an attractive target for any political party in power. The public media under previous governments were certainly biased, presenting just the one view on Polish politics. But commercial TV stations like Polsat offer an alternative view. Commercial media stations are usually still aligned with the previous governments' views, whereas public stations reflect the views of the ruling party. They both present their own truth."" Thomas Piatek agrees that government-influenced public media is not a new phenomenon in Poland. ""Every government in the past appointed key people in key positions within state-controlled media who supported the current establishment. This has never been an issue for the western media in the past, even when opposition parties have constantly raised the question.""  Katarzyna also points out that private broadcasters like Polsat and TVN balance out public state media. Nevertheless, she is concerned about the state of public service broadcasting in Poland. ""Every Polish citizen who owns a television set is obliged to pay a fee that supports the public television broadcaster. That is one of the reasons why public TV and radio should be politically neutral. Instead it presents government propaganda to the public. New public television authorities, appointed by PiS, have already removed around 60 journalists across the board. And according to PiS chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski corresponding with foreign press proves, that I have 'a gene of betrayal.' I guess I have that gene.""",0

The southern state cited security concerns to delay the arrival of the refugees for at least a week until a federal judge can hear the challenge. The lawsuit was brought after the International Rescue Committee (IRC) defied orders from Texas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott to halt the refugees making the state their home following the Paris terror attacks, according to news agency the  Associated Press . Mr Abbott was among more than two dozen governors, mostly Republicans, who vowedto stop Syrian refugees from resettling in their states last month -although President Obama's administration has said states do not have the authority to block refugees in this way.

""Effective today, I am directing the Texas Health and Human Services Commission's Refugee Resttlement Programme to not participate in the resettlement of any Syrian refugees in the state of Texas. ""And I urge you, as President, to halt your plans to allow Syrians to be resettled anywhere in the United States.""

Meanwhile, Indiana's governor said he has asked a Roman Catholic archdiocese to not bring a Syrian refugee family to the state. The archdiocese says the family of four is expected to arrive later this month after a two-year vetting process. The state's Republican Governor Mike Pence said that, in the wake of the attacks in Paris, he could not justify making an exception for the family. In a federal court filing, the Indianapolis-based Exodus Refugee Immigration said Mr Pence's order would ""frustrate and thwart""its mission of helping refugees.",0

The US is riven by debate over whether or not to permit the entry ofrefugees fleeing Syria, which has suffered from the violence of more than four years of civil war. President Barack Obama has said he wants to admit 10,000 refugees within a year, after close vetting. A number of campaigners have called that figure too low and pointed to nations such as Germany that have accepted hundreds of thousands of people.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, claimed it was the second time the Jub al-Quba neighborhood in eastern Aleppo was struck in as many days. An air strike killed 25 civilians on Tuesday. Thousands of east Aleppo residents have moved to Jub al-Quba and other such neighborhoods fleeing a government advance on the rebel-held east. Also yesterday, Syrian state media said two children were among the eight killed in shelling on the city's governement western neighborhoods, which it blamed on the rebels. The assault by Syrian forces comes amid warnings the city could witness one of the biggest massacres since the Second World War as President Assad's troops continue their offensive to re-take the city. A sweeping advance by the Russian-backed Syrian army and allied militias has displaced thousands of people, leaving residents unsure where to turn to for safety as the frontline fighting rapidly moves and rebels struggle to maintain control of key neighbourhoods, the UN said on Tuesday. Syrian Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said he predicts death tolls will spiral in east Aleppo as the internal displacement creates more residential density. Since mid-November, more than 739 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in regime attacks on eastern Aleppo, according to figures released by local civil defense officials. According to the Observatory, more than 50,000 out of an estimated quarter-million inhabitants have been displaced by attacks on rebel-held eastern Aleppo over the past four days. Many of them fled to safer ground in areas under government or Kurdish control. The International Committee of the Red Cross says around 20,000 people have fled. The Observatory also claimed that the Syrian government had detained hundreds of people forced to flee the fighting. The Observatory said the government was detaining and questioning displaced people who have fled towards northeastern parts of the city. Some of the young men may be taken to join the army, while others may be investigated, it claimed, with more than 300 people missing. A Syrian military source, talking to Reuters, denied anyone had been arrested but said the identities of people leaving rebel-held areas were being checked and that anyone who was unknown was being put in ""specific places"" in areas where civilians were gathered. The source said this was in case militants had left with them. ""A large amount of people came out,"" the source said. ""There are enormous numbers that need checking and follow-up. That's the situation."" The Lebanese Al-Manar TV channel reported from the Aleppo countryside that pro-government forces were advancing in the southern portion of the city's rebel enclave. The government has seized much of the northern half of the enclave in the past few days.",0

The Republican candidate has made the claim on numerous occasions and repeated the assertions during his third and final television debate with Hillary Clinton.

Trump says Clinton has been 'fighting Isis her entire adult life' Ben Emmerson, the UN's special rapporteur on the protection of human rights in counter-terrorism, said his own investigation concluded that ""there is no evidence that terrorist groups take advantage of refugee flows to carry out acts of terrorism, or that refugees are somehow more prone to radicalisation than others"".

""And irresponsible statements of the kind made by Mr Trump on Wednesday do nothing but fuel prejudice and stigma."" Mr Emmerson, a British barrister, said there was ""almost no statistical support"" for the Presidential candidate's claims. He added: ""The reason I single out Donald Trump is because I think he went further than any other leader has gone by asserting that there was definitely a link between substantial numbers of Syrian refugees into the United States and Isis, and that is nothing more or less than a xenophobic lie."" The special rapporteur said national security risks caused by the refugee crisis had been ""irresponsibly and misleadingly overblown in many countries"", with terrorism being used to stoke public fear. Mr Emmerson said Mr Trump's comments were ""one of the clearest examples"", amounting to ""the peddling of lies and xenophobia."" His report on the impact of counter-terrorism measures on the human rights of migrants and refugees has been presented to the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump's presidential campaign has been dogged by controversies over his statements on Muslims and refugees, although widespread criticism is deemed unlikely to sway much of his support base. Last year he called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US, before backtracking on the proposal, and has since been ridiculed for appearing to claim Isis had been in existence for 50 years.

Nick Clegg, who has been pressing David Cameron for weeks to admit hundreds of refugees, said the UK would open its doors to women and girls who had experienced or were at risk from sexual violence, the elderly, the disabled and survivors of torture. Mr Cameron overruled objections from Theresa May, the Home Secretary, who wants to do everything to ensure the Conservatives meet their target to reduce net migration below 100,000 by next year's general election. ""He realised that, although we are the good guys and the second largest donor of humanitarian aid to Syria in the world, we were in danger of looking like the villains,"" said one Government insider. Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council, which co-ordinated two open letters to Mr Cameron published in The Independent, said: ""This isn't about party politics, it's about compassion and the Refugee Council is delighted the UK Government looks set to deploy a full spectrum of solutions in addressing the greatest refugee crisis of our time."" He added that The Independent deserved ""the highest praise"" for its sustained coverage of the issue. Britain will not join the UNHRC programme to resettle 30,000 Syrian refugees, which Mrs May warned would set a precedent, so it will not fix a formal quota. But the UNHRC has backed the Government's move and will work closely with it to identify refugees in urgent need of help. ""We are not focused on a target, we're focused on helping the most vulnerable,"" said a Whitehall source. About 500 Syrians are expected to come to the UK over the next year. Mr Clegg said: ""The Coalition Government wants to play our part in helping to alleviate the immense suffering in Syria. ""We are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and I believe we have a moral responsibility to help. Sadly we cannot provide safety for everyone who needs it, but we can reach out to some of those who need it most."" The Deputy Prime Minister's announcement takes the heat out of a Commons debate on the issue today called by Labour. The Government's previous hard line had raised the prospect of an embarrassing defeat amid all-party criticism of its stance. Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, who led the demands for a U-turn, said: ""Compassion and common sense have prevailed over government and ministerial resistance."" She added: ""Given the considerable flexibility in the UN programme for countries to set their own priorities, numbers and security checks, the benefits of not running parallel bureaucracy and the value of being able to encourage other countries to follow suit, the Government would be best to sign up with the UN."" She said ministers now need to confirm that the 500 would not be at the expense of the 750 refugees the UK accepts every year. She called for refugees to be exempt from the Tories' migration target Syamend Farhan, a Syrian refugee living in Manchester, welcomed the Government's move, saying: ""I am very happy to hear that because I lived what they are living???The first thing they are going to escape is hunger, and the risk of dying. Getting a passport in Syria at the moment is impossible. People aren't able even to move to Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan. I was lucky, I already had a passport."" The 21-year-old student added that even taking a few ""from the mass of those suffering means something"".

Despite all the outpourings of international sympathy for Syria's children there has been a lack of hard cash from international donors. Yet the sums involved are pathetically small beer for Western Governments. The UN says that just £145m is required for Syrian refugee education. If Governments had done what they promised, there would be no problem, but less than a quarter of pledged funds have actually been paid. A lack of funding means that aid agencies have been forced to cut monthly payments for thousands of refugees, which leaves those living in countries like Jordan without free education unable to afford the school fees. In refugee camps, it also means that education is badly overstretched. For instance in Jordan's huge Za'atari camp class sizes of 80 - 120 are common. Improving poor teacher pay in the camps, hiring more of them, and giving them better training, would improve the nightmarish conditions of overcrowded classrooms and language barriers that they face every day. Given the stretched resources of the host governments, this funding can only come from international donors. The experience of conflict zones from Rwanda to Bosnia is that those in secondary and vocational education tend to see the greatest disruption to their education. Refugee teenagers are often forced to work since their families, who have spent all their savings on the journey, can no longer support them. Education for older teenagers remains a Cinderella cause - donors tend to focus slim resources on the primary years. For the future of Syria it is essential that this generation of young people are given skills to help rebuild the country and to avoid the hopelessness that could see them sucked into violent extremism. Read more Will Manchester now be able to drag young people back from London? The international community also needs to give financial support to countries such as Lebanon that are becoming overwhelmed by the pressures placed on their schools by the influx of newcomers. This can have a negative impact on the Lebanese children in class, who can be held back while Syrian children, who speak only Arabic, take class-time to learn rudimentary English or French. To aid integration, more international funding needs to be given to ensure that the settled population in refugee host countries does not see a decline in education quality. This is already happening in some countries. UN agencies, the World Bank and bilateral donors have agreed to provide 200,000 free school places in Lebanon for Syrian refugees, covering the cost of tuition, schoolbooks and basic stationary, relieving some of the pressure on the public school system. This kind of support must be extended to Turkey and Jordan, where the education system is being stretched by the crisis. Funding is not only required in the classroom. Many Syrians already have qualifications that are not recognized outside the country. Years of study and knowledge count for nothing in many of the countries to which they have fled. There needs to be a concerted effort to calibrate what equivalent of these qualifications is in their new countries.Those who fled with barely the clothes on their backs often do not have the necessary paperwork to prove their qualifications. Resources need to be invested in a system that, where possible, collects the available data from Syria - and allows schools, universities and employers to verify which qualifications an individual holds. Read more Five Muslim conspiracy theories that will terrify you Many of the problems facing young Syrian refugees are hard to fix - from the physical and mental scars of war to the sense of cultural dislocation that comes from having to leave their homes. But finding the comparatively small sum needed to provide decent education should be simple - particularly when vast sums are being allocated to help the refugees that make it to European countries. Germany alone has budgeted £4.7bn to help predominantly Syrian asylum seekers in the country.

The famous names called for David Cameron to add Britain's welcome as a safe haven to the list of non-violent support the country offers in a bid to alleviate the bloody conflict. Monty Python star Michael Palin, fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, actress Juliet Stevenson, artist Grayson Perry and Firth's wife Livia also signed the letter, supporting the Refugee Council's call for the UK to provide shelter for 30,000 of the most vulnerable Syrians fleeing civil war. The plea asks that Britain keep up with the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which said 18 western countries have so far met its request to provide 30,000 places each by the end of the year. The stars also asked the Prime Minister to do more to make it easier for those Syrians with a British connection to enter the country and join their families and communities. The letter, signed first by Thompson as a patron of the Refugee Council, read: ""International consensus is growing that we need to do more to help people fleeing the violence reach safety. UNHCR have called for western countries to take 30,000 of the most vulnerable and so far 18 countries have responded by pledging resettlement places for Syrian refugees.  ""We're ashamed that Britain isn't one of them, especially because the world is a long way off reaching the 30,000 minimum target set by UNHCR. ""Now is the time to step forward and play our part in delivering a global solution so that those who are most vulnerable find safety outside of the region: women at risk of sexual violence; children who have been orphaned; people who simply will not survive in the conditions in the camps on Syria's borders.

For a moment, the indignity done to the boy and his grieving family seemed to offer hope that a prevailing political hostility to refugees fleeing to Europe would be overcome. Alan Kurdi became a symbol of the plight of so many others fleeing conflict and persecution in Syria and elsewhere. His tragic death laid bare the consequences of governments' refusal to provide the safe routes they and their families need to reach a place where they can rebuild shattered lives. David Cameron, then Prime Minister, declared how deeply moved he was by the dead boy's image. He quickly announced a substantial expansion of what had been a tiny UK resettlement programme for Syrian refugees. But hope faded fast. Theresa May, as Home Secretary, spoke at the Conservative Party conference barely a month later. She vowed to reduce the number of people reaching the UK to seek asylum, and to be even less tolerant of those who did. ""Not in a thousand years"" would the UK join Europe in a common approach, she added. ""Leadership"" of this kind on this issue was not new from the then Home Secretary. Needless to say, it did nothing to help secure collective commitment across Europe to respect the right to asylum of people forced to seek safety by crossing the sea. Instead, various countries rushed to build more walls, fences and other less tangible barriers, from which smugglers and corrupt officials continued to profit by exploiting those needing to get past. And in spring 2016, with the EU Turkey deal, European countries agreed to pay Turkey to take back people who crossed to Greece while preventing others from making the journey. This agreement has been celebrated by politicians and political commentators across Europe, including in the UK. Yet, since the deal tens of thousands of women, men and children have been trapped in limbo in Greece. Turkey has descended rapidly into authoritarianism with an increasing risk that many of its citizens will need to flee the country. And other countries have followed Europe in excluding and evicting refugees. For all the political soundbites about how UK Government policy has been to keep refugees ""safe in the region"", the reality is that Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan have each been forcing Syrians back to conflict and terror while preventing others from escaping. But it doesn't end there. In her 2015 party conference speech, our current Prime Minister looked back to when - as she somewhat modestly put it - ""despite its many flaws and its criminal leadership, Libya was known as Europe's forward border"". The nostalgia for a time, in which British officials could work with a repressive Libyan regime to prevent people fleeing war and poverty from reaching Europe, was palpable. The UK Government, like others in Europe, is once again dealing with Libya to try to block migration. But there is no Libyan regime now. Rather there are disparate parties, tribes and militias vying for power, legitimacy and money. In this chaos, migrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation - whether they came to Libya to work or already hoping to reach Europe. Slavery, kidnapping for ransom, torture and rape are just some of the myriad abuses and atrocities refugees and other migrants suffer in Libya. Whether held in official detention centres or by gangs and militias, they are at risk. As highlighted by Amnesty's recent report ""Europe: A perfect storm"", supporting corrupt bodies in Libya such as the coastguard exposes people to these horrors. As European governments' assistance grows in trapping or returning people to Libya, they too will be complicit in human rights violations. Those vying for power - whether to run the country or control a neighbourhood - now see the chance of securing European money by promising to curb migration to Europe. While the cash flows, they may be content to shut down smuggling routes. If it dries up, they can reopen those routes - whatever pays best. And why would they ever completely close these routes? Simply ending migration would remove their hold over those governments willing to pay or provide political backing. Meanwhile, there are other opportunities to exploit people who need to get out of Libya. Two years on from a moment when public and politicians cried ""never again"", it is all too clear that our political leaders have not set out to end the death and suffering of people forced to flee, nor their mistreatment at the hands of armed gangs and corrupt officials. Rather, our leaders seem determined merely to keep as far away as possible the death and suffering of the children, women and men who - just like Alan Kurdi - have only smugglers and other abusers to turn to in their desperate search for safety. Out of sight, out of mind. Deals that may temporarily slow migration at the cost of prolonging violence and suffering or exacerbating the root causes of why people need to flee are cruel and shortsighted. Governments must prioritise saving lives by maintaining search and rescue at sea while extending resettlement, family reunion and other visas for refugees to reach safety. Over the longer term, they must address those root causes - conflict, repression and global inequality. Steve Valdez-Symonds is Amnesty UK's Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme Director",1

They wereset to cave in to fresh demands from Turkey for an extra (EURO)3bn in aid - double the previously agreed figure - to help prevent Syrian refugees leaving Turkish soil. The last-minute demands came as EU leaders met in Brussels to try and agree measures to halt the flow of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The aid would be provided until the end of 2018 to help Ankara shelter the estimated 2.5 million Syrians currently living in Turkey, rather than wave them on towards the EU. It is part of a package, negotiated with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, that comes with the promise of visa-free travel for Turks wishing to visit Europe by the end of June, at least four months earlier than planned, if Ankara agrees to introduce biometric passports.  Read more Turkey's argument on refugees is about pride - not just money It also includes plans for a resettlement scheme under which the EU would admit one Syrian refugee for every Syrian taken back by Turkey from the Greek islands. Turkey would also readmit all ""irregular"" migrants - those who do not qualify for refugee status - who cross into Greek islands from Turkey. Mr Davutoglu used the summit to push for an acceleration of talks on Turkish membership of the EU. ""Turkey is ready to work with the EU, and Turkey is ready to be a member of the EU as well,"" he said. He also said Turkey wanted the EU to help establish humanitarian safe zones inside Syria for refugees. The EU offer came after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused it of failing to live up to the (EURO)3bn deal agreed last November to help Turkey deal with its influx of refugees. ""It's been four months. They are yet to deliver,"" he said. ""My Prime Minister is currently in Brussels. I hope he will return with the money."" David Cameron said that Britain would not join a common asylum process in Europe (AFP) Mr Erdogan said Turkey had spent about (EURO)10bn on the Syrian refugees living in the camps since 2011, and was struggling to meet the needs of a growing number of refugees. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU should try to slash the flow of migrants entering illegally ""and not just for a few countries, but for all countries. That means for Greece too.""

The summit comes three days after the Turkish government's seizure of Zaman, the country's largest daily newspaper. But the EU was careful not to tie the crackdown with Ankara's demands. Prime Minister David Cameron raised concerns about press freedom with Mr Davutoglu during the summit, an official said, noting that he underlined the importance of protections for a free press and human rights.  French President François Hollande added that ""co-operation with Turkey doesn't mean accepting everything from Turkey"". While EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that Turkey must ""respect the highest standards when it comes to democracy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms"". EU leaders were also wrangling over plans to close the so-called Balkans route, which more than one million migrants have taken over the past year as they have travelled north from Greece to Germany. The route is now effectively closed after Macedonia - backed by Austria, Croatia, Slovenia and Hungary - limited border crossings, boxing in an estimated 14,000 refugees at Greece's northern frontier. Ms Merkel said she would block any agreement to permanently close borders. Meanwhile, Mr Cameron pledged that Britain would not take part in a planned common EU asylum policy. ""We have an absolutely rock solid opt-out from these things, so there's no prospect of Britain joining a common asylum process in Europe,"" he said.  The Prime Minister was speaking ahead of European Commission proposals - set to be unveiled next week - to take control of asylum claims.

As I stated, 'we should stop being so sentimental and we should actually be looking at what the best thing to do [is] for these families and children',"" she said. ""I admit this was not the best choice of words from me, and what I meant is that we should analyse the issue objectively to provide the most useful help and ensure the greatest level of safety for the children, not that we should not care.

More than 650,000 Syrians are registered as refugees in Jordan, according to the United Nations. Last year the Government of Jordan pledged to issue up to 200,000 works permits for Syrians to allow them to work legally alongside Jordanians.

2566,src_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,3/1/2014,1401 words,Independent Voices,Letters: We must open our door to Syrian refugees; These letters appear in the 4th January edition of the Independent,Broadsheet,"Your article ""Farage calls on Britain to admit Syrian war refugees"" (30 December) raised the issue that we have flatly refused to take in a single family fleeing Syria.  In seeking to hold the Coalition to account on this crucial matter, I have secured a debate and will be asking the Government to take action in conjunction with other EU member states to establish a European-wide evacuation and resettlement programme for those fleeing the conflict.  I hope colleagues from all parties (and none) will take up this opportunity (on 9 January) and contribute constructively to the debate. The UK can and must lead the EU in living out the true meaning of its creed and offer a safe haven for refugees fleeing such a dreadful war.  While I am proud that the Government has given financial assistance to NGOs working in Syria, and to Syria's neighbours who have taken on the burden of accepting so many seeking refuge, more must be done. We cannot fail the people of Syria. Rev Lord Roberts of Llandudno, President, Liberal Democrats for Seekers of Sanctuary, House of Lords, London SW1  Andy Turney (letter, 2 January) seems to believe that the West's lack of intervention in Syria in 2013 is something to be celebrated. I'm not sure it's time to reach for the bubbly just yet.  Not only is Assad continuing to butcher his own people, he has dragged his feet on the issue of chemical weapons and is getting even further into bed with Vladimir Putin.  The death toll in Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human rights, has just passed 130,000. There is a worrying trend at present for overlooking the deaths of innocents in far-off lands if those deaths have nothing to do with the West. Only if we are in some way involved do those killings appear to count in the minds of some.  There are plenty who are shrill when Western governments contemplate ways of trying to prevent bloodshed, but if the West steers clear of the killing fields you'll hear a deafening silence as bodies pile up.  The deaths of all innocent people count at all times. I'll leave the champagne on ice.  Phil Edwards, Godalming, Surrey I wonder how many of your readers would take issue with your leader ""Let them in - Britain has a moral duty to help Syria's refugees"" (26 December). Although alluded to in your news coverage, nowhere in your editorial is Britain's contribution of £500m of aid to Syria acknowledged.  The opposition, ready as usual to criticise the Government's reluctance to accept Syrian refugees, seems ready to forget - when convenient - that charity should begin at home, and more than ready to turn a blind eye to our overburdened infrastructure and social services. Common sense is often misconstrued as being mean-spirited or nothing more than a hurdle to be overcome.  Attempting to find a metaphor for what too often is labelled racism - but is nothing more than a sensible solution to overload - one could consider Samuel Plimsoll's controversial line upon seagoing vessels which was adopted as a warning that they were dangerously overloaded.  Common sense did prevail in that case. When will we, as a nation, be ready to recognise it in limiting the number of entrants to our shores until our resources have recovered from unregulated immigration and are once more fit for purpose? Peter Troy, Headington, Oxford Congratulations on your editorial calling on Britain to join the US, France and Germany in taking its share of Syrian refugees. The Green Party joins you in that call. Among the more than two million Syrians who have fled their country, about 800,000 are in Lebanon, 500,000 each in Jordan and Turkey, and about 8,000 across the entire EU.  Those who are particularly vulnerable need more than the basic protection these regional countries are able to offer, and the UK, as one of the world's richest countries, with a long and honourable history of providing asylum, has a responsibility to be again a place of refuge. Natalie Bennett, Green Party Leader, London NW1 NHS should be free when needed most One in three doctors is in favour of charging for A&E services (""Charge £10 to keep timewasters away from A&E, say GPs"", 3 January). This is a response to increasing attendances at A&E and is one of the Government's own design, having made it more and more difficult to get services from the local GP surgery or health centre.  If these A&E charges were ever enacted, it would end the principle that the NHS provides services free at the point of delivery. It will also increase still further the administrative burden on our overstretched health sector, which would have to judge whether a visit was necessary and issue the refunds to those ""deserving"" cases.  We currently all pay for the health of our citizens, proportionate to what we can afford, through general taxation. If we were to move to a society where people pay for the services that we use (or even deserve), should we be charging more tax for mountain climbers and skateboarders and less for childless couples? Should smokers and drinkers be penalised?  As a childless, non-smoking couple who do not participate in adventure sports, we could look forward to tax rebates, but we are daft enough to believe in the old-fashioned principle that we should pay our fair share towards the health of all of our citizens and that these services should be provided free when they are needed most.  Peter and Susan Rowberry, Saxmundham, Suffolk  There are those who want people to be charged for going to A&E. But what about those like me who neither keep spare cash nor have a credit card? We also live alone, so can't necessarily borrow the money from someone. Will we have to show a bank book or statement saying how much money we have before being seen to? If so, this is another step towards dismantling our NHS, as well as penalising the poorest. Tim Mickleburgh, Grimsby Another way to measure our progress Eighty years ago today, a report was presented to the US Senate which, by common consent, marks the birth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The brainchild of US economist Simon Kuznets, GDP was designed to provide information about economic activity during the Depression.  It has since assumed an almost unassailable authority as the de facto measure of a country's progress. However, as the world faces new economic and social challenges, we must all ask ourselves what more should be done do to measure progress. Last year, the Social Progress Index (SPI) was launched - an attempt to provide a more complete picture of nations' social progress, designed to complement GDP and help governments frame global, national and local responses to address societies' challenges. Unlike GDP, which measures the market value of goods and services, the SPI quantifies social output, assessing factors such as political freedoms, availability of quality healthcare, and measurements of citizens' personal safety. Today we celebrate Kuznets' achievement, but we hope that, in another 80 years, generations will look back to the start of the 21st century as the time when nations recognised the value of measuring social progress on a par with economic progress. Michael Green, Executive Director of the Social Progress Imperative, London SW1 A halo for Julian Assange? In his assessment of the P J Harvey edition of Today, Ian Burrell writes (3 January) that he ""didn't feel BBC editorial values were compromised"". Yet the programme contained a Thought for the Day from Julian Assange, who is the subject of a European arrest warrant. Assange used his slot to quote liberally from the Bible, creating something of a halo for himself. I can't see how his inclusion in the programme and his shameless use of his slot to sanctify himself does anything other than reflect badly on BBC editorial values.  David Head, Navenby, Lincolnshire  I concur with Ian Burrell's view that P J Harvey's editorship of Today was ""radical and refreshing"". There is a great need for uncensored, thoughtful news coverage which is not hedged about by dissimulation and toeing the party line.  More from left-leaning academicians and journalists such as John Pilger would present a more balanced, more believable and generally more thought-provoking programme, such as Harvey's surely was.

2607,src_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,23/2/2014,1450 words,WORDS by SARAH MORRISON INTERVIEWS by SAMMY HAMZE,"SYRIA'S DISPOSSESSED; REFUGEE CRISIS At least a million Syrian refugees are now living in Lebanon, almost half of them children. They are being put up in tents, shacks and nine to a room - but 'no one cares', says British photographer Ed Thompson, who spent six days moving among the camps",Broadsheet,"WHEN THE British photojournalist Ed Thompson arrived at a snowy Syrian refugee camp in Lebanon last December, he was greeted by a little boy who ran circles around him, making motorbike sounds. Thompson joined in and the subject of his new project was born. We do not know the name of the boy, or his story. That is partly because Thompson did not make the trip to Lebanon with an NGO or the UN. His visit was instigated by a chance encounter with Sammy Hamze, a 20-year-old Lebanese art student studying in London. They got talking in the pub about the number of Syrians living in Hamze's hometown and, within weeks, were in Lebanon, cameras and notepads in hand. They spent six days in Chhim, western Lebanon, interviewing refugees in camps, those taken in by Lebanese families and those forced to pay steep rent for squalid properties. Keen to break through the political soundbites - lamenting Syria as the ""greatest humanitarian tragedy of our times"" - Thompson wanted to personalise the crisis and draw attention to two startling statistics: that of the nearly one million (official) Syrian refugees displaced in Lebanon, almost half are children; and around one in five, according to Unicef, are less than five years old. We have heard the stories. Children at risk of dying from the cold in refugee camps; vulnerable to trafficking; begging on the side of the road; left orphaned and out of school; girls sold into marriage. But what shook Thompson most was that the children, although appearing older than their years, were still so young. ""They are innocent, completely innocent,"" he says now. ""One father told me to look at his family; he could barely feed his son. They had been through hell, walked through hell and got to hell. All they want to do is go home."" The conflict that has torn Syria apart has raged for almost three years, left more than 100,000 people dead in its wake and driven nine-and-a-half million from their homes. It took intense political pressure to get the British Government to agree to offer hundreds of the ""most needy people"" in Syrian refugee camps a home in this country. ""We live in the modern age - we can read what's going on in Syria; we've never had more information at our fingertips,"" says Thompson - ""but no one cares."" If anything can break through the apathy, it is his pictures. Lebanon must be close to capacity; a quarter of the country's population are now Syrian refugees, the equivalent of 15 million people arriving on Britain's shores. With ailing infrastructure and its own stretched public services, tensions between the Lebanese and the Syrians are said to be rising. Thompson is so worried about both the security of the people he photographed, and their families back at home, that he does not want to disclose their exact location. Their stories are what he wants told. Among them is Barja (not pictured), the mother of two young girls, eight and nine, with disabilities, who fled Syria when her house burnt down. Her husband - the girls' father - was shot and asked Barja to leave him behind. Living in a small rented room in Lebanon for more than a year-and-a-half, she does not know if her partner is alive or dead. ""What am I going to do with my life?"" she asks. ""I barely have money and I cannot afford to get treatment for the girls. Someone help us please."" Then there are the two orphan girls (page 17 - one of whom can be seen peeking through the curtain), whose parents were shot in Syria. A local sheik took them in. More people live under the mosque; some wounded, others scrabbling for food. Many recount what they lost. Wafaa (not pictured) has been living in a Lebanese family's house for a year-and-a-half with her children. She, too, does not know where her husband is and is worried about her sons. ""My sons' futures and education are gone. They were studying medicine and law in Syria. [Now] one works as a janitor in a hospital and he barely gets a good amount of money and my other son works as a labourer. It's sad to see a medical student and a law student doing these jobs; it breaks my heart. We are like everyone else. We are waiting, waiting to go back to Syria."" * At a mosque in Chhim Amer (father of girl on the magazine cover) ""One day my brother and I, our wives, the kids, my father, we decided to escape from our town in Homs. We were being attacked from every side, and as we got in a taxi, we got hit on the road. We managed to get out and run but then a second shell fell next to us and I was hit. When I recovered, we [escaped] to Lebanon. We decided to come to Chhim and thanks to the mosque, we have at least shelter. My brother registered us at the United Nations; they helped for two months but after that they stopped. Without surgery, they'll have to cut off [my leg]. Life has come to a stop for us."" Local sheik (left in picture, right) ""I am in charge of all the refugees here. [These] two [sisters, pictured right] showed up at the town one day; they were in agony, they were helpless. God knows how they found their way from Syria. They told me that their parents got shot, along with everyone from their family, and they escaped. They are so young, it's a miracle they are still alive. I did my best to take them in and help them. They are still in shock and are very depressed; they had nightmares and would run out screaming from the room. I don't know what to do with them except take care of them."" Syrian family living in a small room on the land of a Lebanese family, Chhim Ali (not pictured) ""I brought my family from Syria at the early stages of the war. We are a family of 10.

The United Nations are helping us and others as well. People have been generous to us. There are some issues with privacy: for example, if you wanted to have some alone time with your wife, it's a bit hard. We know nothing about our home or relatives in Syria. Originally we are farmers. I'm used to producing food from our land, but due to these hard situations, money does not stay for a long time. Also, I'm providing for my sister's family as well - her husband died. I wish for the best and to go back [to Syria] soon."" Ketermaya refugee camp, Chhim Abu Ahmad (neither he nor his family are pictured) ""I escaped from Syria under a hail of bullets, gunfire and bombs; it was horrible. I know nothing about my family, my home or my town. I was one of the first settlers who moved here. I was sleeping in a shack made from a carton and garbage. A few days later another family joined me. We had nothing, no money, no food or water. Nothing until one of the townsmen took pity on us. This piece of land we are on is owned by the landlord Ali. He started helping us, then other refugees started to come here , so we started to set up a camp and establish tents from whatever we could find and what was provided to us here by the people of this town. I have been living here for a year-and-a-half. There are 50 families living here with around 250 people. We have suffered from snakes and scorpions during the summer and now we are suffering from this harsh cold winter. No one is helping us from charities, not even the United Nations. They helped us for two months and then they cut us off."" Syrian refugees living in rented houses, Chhim Yaseen Abdulatif El Dos (right, with his children) ""We are living a very hard life; we have nothing. Soon I will have no money to support my family. The water is contaminated. Everything we have here in this room is from the garbage. We had a wonderful life in Syria. Nine people live here in one room and I'm paying $300 rent, and now that winter is here, we are very cold. There's nothing to keep us warm. There's one bathroom open to the kitchen and there is no door. Here's a joke: a rat came in one day and went into the house and he found out that there are Syrian refugees living here so he cursed his head off and left, because we were not Lebanese and had nothing to give him."" Ahmad Taher (pictured below right with his children) ""I live here in this cave under this building. Even the poor Lebanese won't live here. It's infested, it's dangerous and I have two children living here. I'm trying my best but conditions are very hard; eight people live in this room. Everything here is killing us slowly. We are poorer than the poor and everything we have here was donated by the townspeople. When we left from Qusair, Syria, we were shot at; my wife broke her leg as well. Somehow I managed to carry her and the kids to safety here. But what can I say? I don't know what to say any more.""",1

In this cartoon, published exclusively in The Independent, Ferzat, 63, draws stark attention to the plight of 3.7 million Syrian refugees as he accuses Britain of lacking ""the warmth of morals and humanity"" by allowing just 90 refugees from the conflict region to come to Britain. In a brazen act of defiance in 2011, his award-winning caricatures depicted President Assad as a broken dictator, sitting on a broken armchair over a broken country. The regime's response was rapid and brutal; he is now living in exile in Kuwait after masked gunmen, who he describes as ""Assad's thugs"", attempted to silence his sharp satire by pulling him out of his car, shattering his hands and leaving his fingers broken. Ferzat has not been silenced, and to mark the anniversary this week of the British decision to grant a limited number of Syrian refugees asylum, he has called on the UK to ""carry out its duties"" and live up to its promise of helping those affected by the ""biggest tragedy in the world"". Four years of conflict in Syria has created nearly four million refugees, and last January - following a campaign supported by The Independent - the Government committed to resettling 500 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees. However, that pledge was reduced to a commitment to resettle ""several hundred"" Syrians over three years. And to the dismay of aid agencies, just 90 Syrians have arrived under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme. Ferzat, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Peace in 2012 and named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine, said: ""I do not think that the West in general [has] carried out its duties towards Syrian refugees... It has used the policies of the three monkeys: I do not see, I do not hear and I do not talk."" In pictures: Global refugee crisis Ferzat is now working with Amnesty International UK and the London-based aid agency, Mosaic Syria, to bring attention to plight the 3.7 million Syrian refugees, some of whom are in their fourth winter in tented camps. Tomorrow is one year on from when Home Secretary Theresa May bowed to pressure from Labour and the Lib Dems to establish the VPR scheme and this anniversary will see Amnesty International call for rich countries to resettle 10 per cent of Syria's refugees by the end of 2016. In November, the charity joined a call by 30 relief agencies for Britain to resettle up 10,000 refugees in response to a call from the UN's Refugee Agency UNHCR. Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK's director, said: ""Given the scale of the crisis on Syria's borders, the UK's response to the refugee crisis has been pitiful... History will judge the UK's shameful lack of action on taking in refugees as unforgivable - we are talking about people for whom the chance of resettlement may be, literally, a matter of life or death."" Ferzat's call for action comes as faith leaders in Britain have called on David Cameron to act. In a letter published on The Independent website, Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders, have called on the PM urgently to increase the number of Syrians being resettled in the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said the UK has been at the ""forefront of the international response"" to the crisis and had pledged £700m in humanitarian aid. The spokesperson added: ""We have granted asylum or other forms of leave to over 3,400 Syrian nationals and dependants. In addition, through our Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme, we are working closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to identify those most at risk and bring them to the UK."" Arif's story: 'Life is better' When 12-year-old Arif came to Britain this summer he was in urgent need of medical care. With his parents and three siblings he'd fled Syria for Lebanon in 2011 as civil war tore his country apart. His parents, Nabil and Yara, said it was the ""feeling of impotency"" that forced them to flee from the ""risk of arrest"" and bombs that ""fell from all sides"". It was little better in Lebanon, where the family were forced to live in a room with no running water. An accident in the hut in October 2013 left Arif with terrible burns to his legs and, with little money, advanced medical care was hard to come by. It was only last spring, when the family were selected to be resettled in Britain under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme, that Arif finally got the treatment he needed. Now, his parents say, he's ""loving being back in school"" and, for one family at least, ""everything has changed for the better"".  To protect their identity, The Independent has changed the family's names and isn't revealing where in the UK they live ",1

Whatever grumblings and anxieties we are encouraged to express by some elements in the media, the fact is that most people in the UK know when a crisis demands generosity. They recognise that they are dealing not with distant statistical realities, but with families and children whose needs are like their own.  So the arrival of a small number of refugees from Syria under the Government's Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme is very much in tune with this tradition. The number may not be large, but it gives us an opportunity to register more clearly the scale of the humanitarian disaster that has overtaken not only Syria but the whole region. These are people who have suffered trauma, humiliation and fear that we cannot imagine, rape, torture and constant terror.  It is good that the Government- in accordance with the Foreign Secretary's declared concerns about victims of torture and gender-related violence - has opened the door to them, albeit after considerable pressure from the Refugee Council and others. We, the public, now need to promise our support for more humanitarian action, globally co-ordinated. It is not only Syria's problem. Neighbouring countries - Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt - have between them received nearly two and a half million refugees. They have had no choice in the matter. And these are countries ill-equipped to absorb such a level of need, given the instability, stress and stretched resources many of them are already living with. Plenty is being done on the ground by various agencies like Christian Aid and others; working with courageous groups within Syria who take the gravest risks for the sake of the care of vulnerable people in the country (two of those working with Christian Aid's local partner have been killed in recent months).  In pictures: Syria's escalating refugee crisis But there needs to be globally co-ordinated action - as the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has recently insisted, appealing for governments round the world to provide an additional 100,000 resettlement places to refugees from Syria in 2015 and 2016.  We have to keep up pressure in our own and other governments to stand together in this drive for a global resettlement strategy, along with pressure for a firm guarantee of humanitarian access to communities under siege. It may suit some to portray the arrival of refugees as another drain on our resources. Indeed, this has been said at every important point in the last century when Britain stepped up to shoulder its moral responsibilities to those at mortal risk. And at every point the compassionate and hospitable instinct of the British people triumphed over the negative voices and sour predictions.  We can hardly be happy that such help is needed, but we can reasonably be thankful that the UK is still able to honour its historic commitments to those who have been the victims of tyranny and atrocity. And we can hope that it will set the pace for the development of a global response to one of the most appalling humanitarian catastrophes of our era.",1

A lot, as Holly Williams finds out from a new documentary",Broadsheet,"'I have a scream I have to let out - I want the world to hear it."" So says Suad, a young Syrian woman who fled her homeland for Jordan. It's one of the most powerful moments in a new documentary, Queens of Syria, which follows a 2013 theatre project run with Syrian refugee women in the Jordanian capital, Amman, to stage a new version of Euripides's tragedy, The Trojan Women. The laments of the women of Troy, grieving for dead husbands and children and the destruction of their homes, may have been written in 415 BC - but we see how they ring all too-true to these modern victims of war, and how the women become passionate about using this ancient Greek text to tell their own stories. ""This is real ... it's not just in Troy,"" says one young woman, Maha, to the camera. ""This has happened for real. It has happened to us."" Yasmin Fedda's film follows rehearsals to the final performance, given in Amman in winter 2013. And Queens of Syria is now getting its London premiere, as part of the Shubbak: A Window on Contemporary Arab Culture festival. Almost four million people have fled Syria since the civil war began, and more than 600,000 of them have settled in Jordan. But despite such vast numbers, it can be a lonely, isolating experience - and for many who took part in the seven-week project, it was an invaluable way to meet others. Around 60 women initially showed up though only 25 saw the project through to the final weeks. For them, ""there was definitely [a growing] camaraderie and friendship,"" says Fedda, as they shared their stories and realised they were not alone in what they'd experienced. As well as being an Arabic translation, their version of The Trojan Women wove in the performers' accounts of their own experiences of war, which they spoke simply, sitting at a microphone under a spotlight. The women's encounters with the Assad regime or with violent militias are harrowing, and Fedda's film features the moments when women first share them in workshops - often breaking down at the memory. One woman tells how 15 armed, masked men burst into her house, and threatened her at gunpoint when her brother refused to go with them; later she heard he had been found shot dead. Another tells how her father was repeatedly detained; once, shortly after he'd had a prostate operation, they found him dumped on the roadside, catheters hanging out of him. Another tells how her father and two brothers were tied up, blindfolded and shot, before being thrown into a mass grave. The project was the idea of a British couple, film-makers Charlotte Eagar and William Stirling; both classicists, they saw the potential parallels between the Ancient Greek and real-life modern tragedies and the way in which the former might enable performers to discuss the latter. To facilitate this, Eagar and Stirling brought in Syrian theatre director Omar Abu Saada, as well as Nanda Mohammad, a soap star familiar to the amateur cast. Award-winning filmmaker Fedda, who is based in London but has lived in Syria where she still has family, was an obvious choice to document the process. Queens of Syria has already won Fedda the prize of best director from the Arab world at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival. Fedda says she very quickly became convinced of the merits of the theatrical project. ""From what I witnessed, it was definitely an important process - to share, and to feel the other people caring for you, and maybe to grieve if you need to."" For her, the film was more about documenting and celebrating this process than about the final performance. They also made a shorter TV cut for BBC Arabic, which has an audience of 36.2 million. Knowing their stories would be broadcast to so many was hugely empowering. Some participants felt the world wasn't hearing ordinary Syrians; Suad describes how a massacre on her street in which 400 died and her three brothers were injured attracted no reporting at all. But, on the flipside, the exposure was a terrifying prospect for many. Most long to go home to Syria, and several feared being recognised from the project. Others feared for the safety of loved ones still in Syria. ""If they seem to be saying something against the regime or against any particular group, that could have repercussions,"" acknowledges Fedda gravely. ""Militias or regimes will take close [family] members of known people as a form of torture. It can happen, it's not unimaginable."" But, she explains, the anxiety was often less specific than that: ""The fear is so deep inside that it isn't always easy to say 'I am scared because this direct thing will happen' - it's just, 'I am scared'. They grew up in a dictatorship which instils fear."" One of the beautiful things about the film, however, is watching the grip of that fear begin to slip: in early scenes, many women are nervous about the film, and ask that their faces not be shown, but by the final performance, only one woman is pixellated. Participants became used to the camera, and grew to trust Fedda; in the end, most were proud to go on record. There were also fears closer to home, however: acting was not always deemed appropriate behaviour by their husbands or family, and others feared that performing was immodest. ""Some found a way to make it acceptable - 'I'm not really acting, I'm sharing my story',"" explains Fedda. However, in the end, the reaction to the production was hugely positive. ""Everyone was crying, and all the husbands were so proud and so happy. A bunch of them even [recognised] that their wives had had nothing to do; [the project] gave them excitement, community, a reason to wake up - and I think when the woman feels that, the whole household gets a sense of energy."" If some women downplayed their theatrical ambitions, others embraced their inner diva: ""For some, it was very much 'I'm on stage - I'm an actress!'"" As well as revealing the hardships these women faced, the film gives us a glimpse of their humour and high spirits. To see Syrian women larking about - tickling each other, singing songs, putting on lipstick - makes you realise how rarely we see cheerful everyday portrayals of any Muslim women, let alone refugees. ""It was important to me to show they are just normal people,"" agrees Fedda. ""Even when things are terrible, people laugh, people produce art, they express themselves in all sorts of ways. It's important to show the lightness in the darkness."" 'Queens of Syria' screens at the Barbican on 15 July, with a Q&A with Yasmin Fedda; shubbak.co.uk",0

Abdullah Kurdi will use the platform to plead for ""a little bit of sympathy"" for those who are merely ""seeking peace and security"". The death of his son, Aylan, in September inspired a media outcry which is credited with transforming public opinion on refugees fleeing the crisis in Syria. The Independent put the haunting picture of the drowned toddler on its front page and the tragedy became the subject of a social media storm. Researchers at Sheffield University found that pictures of Aylan - taken by a Turkish press photographer, Nilufer Demir - were the subject of 53,000 tweets per hour on Twitter, appearing on 20 million phone and computer screens around the world in a 12-hour period. Politicians were moved to act. David Cameron announced that the UK would take ""thousands"" more Syrian refugees and that further aid would be provided to camps in Syria, Turkey, Jordan and the Lebanon. In his Channel 4 address, Mr Abdullah - who also lost his wife, Rehanna, and five-year-old son, Galeb, as the family tried to reach Greece on an overcrowded inflatable craft which capsized - will appeal for the world to do much more. ""We Syrians leave our country due to war. We all are afraid for our children, for our honour. There are barrel bombs, explosions and also Daesh [Isis]. We have hundreds of thousands of problems,"" he says. ""My message is I'd like the whole world to open its doors to Syrians. If a person shuts a door in someone's face, this is very difficult.

2850,src_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,21/9/2015,975 words,Robert Fisk,"In Canada, Harper's Conservatives seem to have forgotten a cherished tradition",Broadsheet,"Europe's refugee epic reached as far as the frozen heights of the Rockies yesterday, in a gentle, very Canadian way. At an international economics conference in the grand old town of Banff - snow already dusting the slopes of Mount Rundle far above us - Dr Tom Thompson of Olds College, the largest agricultural school in Alberta, came up to ask me how he might bring Syrian refugees to his university. ""It is our Canadian tradition, to help refugee families,"" he told me. ""I'd love to help."" I put him in touch by phone with international agricultural advisers in the Arab world, including Beirut. He meant what he said. Just as, on the other side of the mountains on squeaky-clean Vancouver Island, the leader of Canada's Green Party - two MPs in Ottawa, perhaps another 10 after the 19 October national elections - wants to help the Arab refugees streaming up the landmass of Europe. Elizabeth May was herself once a refugee lawyer (she used to help ship-jumpers in Halifax port) and wants Canada to shine in its response to something her country has always cherished: helping the world's poor and oppressed. Canada took in the huddled masses of Vietnamese boat people - 55,000 of them - in the 1970s. So why not the Syrians, and Iraqis, and Afghans, today? But here, alas, we must report a sordid and bigoted tale deep within a country famous for its multiculturalism. Stephen Harper's weird Conservative government - its security laws fear-mongering their way through a population normally famous for its generosity - is even more reluctant than our own beloved David Cameron's Cabinet to take in the families fighting their way from the death-pits of the Middle East. Harper's been talking oddly of ""old-stock Canadians"" - effectively excluding hundreds of thousands of Canada's new Muslim population from the country's modern history, and virtually second-tiering their citizenship. His immigration minister, Chris Alexander - desperately trying to claw back any shred of the Canadian Conservative Party's principals - has been talking these past few hours of taking in more than an earlier figure of 20,000. This was also an attempt to clean up his own reputation after scolding a television journalist and the media in general for not paying attention to the crisis - when he had himself been refusing all interviews on the subject. Canada has made plenty of offers of help to Christian, Yazidi and other minority groups fleeing Isis territory over the past year, but precious few for the latest and far more formidable exodus, on grounds that are perfectly clear to millions of Canadians: they are Sunni Muslims. Right-wing newspapers and ministers have tried - without any evidence - to suggest that Isis has hidden its agents among the refugees, thus presenting the suffering of these people not as a humanitarian concern but as security problem. These snide attempts to smear hundreds of thousands of people as terrorists have reached proportions which would be comical if they were not so immoral. Harper's Defence Minister, Jason Kenney, has blathered on about meeting refugees in Middle East camps whose relatives were fighting a ""jihad"" against the Syrian regime - something the West has been encouraging Syrians to do for three years - and thus security must ""take precedence"" over receiving those fleeing the battlefields. His grotesque sympathy for the refugees makes cringing reading, for he damns them even as he claims to agree with their innocence. ""I do not mean to suggest for a moment that all or most of the people in the camps are connected to terrorist organisations or contribute a security risk but it is plainly evident that some do. It would be imprudent in the extreme to pretend otherwise."" Not for a moment, indeed??? And note the ""all or most"" bit: if all or most of the refugees are not ""terrorists"" then presumably an awful lot are: that's the wretched man's message! As the Toronto Star columnist Haroun Siddiqui commented, Harper's government is ""pandering to the dangerous stereotype that all Muslims are potential terrorists"". And not only the government. In a particularly frightening article in the right-wing National Post, Father Raymond J De Souza, a Canadian university chaplain as well as a parish priest, says that refugee camps are home to ""Sunni Muslims, not a few of which look kindly towards Isil [Isis]"" and that ""it would be foolish to bring to Canada extremist elements that may be useful in making trouble for Assad but would also be troublesome in Canada"". Individual church groups are trying to help, but somehow the good father's message seems a little different from what Christ would have said. Sure, a new opinion poll suggests that 38 per cent of Canadians still believe Harper's lads and lassies would ""make the best decision for Canada on the Syrian refugee situation"", but at least Canada's ex-military men - usually the most flatulent of crusty old generals - have had the guts to walk a little taller than the politicians. The country's former military commander Rick Hillier is suggesting that Canada's armed forces themselves could bring in 50,000 Syrian refugees by Christmas. Roméo Dallaire, the UN's commander in the Rwanda bloodbath, a fine man deeply troubled by what he was forced to witness in Africa, has talked of bringing up to 90,000 Syrian refugees to Canada who would be an ""asset"" to the country. Security is a smokescreen, he says. ""I think Canada and its decision so far in regards to refugees is nothing less than atrocious and totally foreign to what and who we are."" Back in the 1970s, Canadian politicians sowed the same ""security"" rubbish about the Vietnamese boat people - they might be ""communist"" was the tag-line then, though not one turned out to be. But the Harper gang probably haven't read that far back in their country's history. Be sure that Dr Thompson has.",0

""That attack on children... had a big effect on me,"" Trump said in a press conference on Wednesday. ""My attitude towards Syria and Assad has changed very much."" Suddenly, Trump feels a ""responsibility"" to the Syrian people, and the media is lauding his change of heart. It's tempting to believe that the President of the United States is a decent human being, moved by pictures of dead children and compelled to act by breeches of international law and human rights.Yet nothing about Trump's long, well documented career indicates that he's capable of compassion, let alone towards persecuted Muslims. I don't buy Trump's false conversion. He has routinely tweeted that the President needs congressional approval to use military force, something he didn't seek. He has, until now, demonstrated isolationist instincts that preclude America acting in its traditional role of world police. He has banned Syrian refugees from entering the US and demonised Muslims on the campaign trail. Considering literally everything Trump has said and done over the past several years, forgive me if it's hard to fathom that he's acting entirely altruistically. US air strikes in Syria: How the world reacted It's a truism in American politics that military action can improve a president's poll numbers and Trump needs Americans to forget his disastrous defeat on Obamacare repeal, which showed that the deal maker couldn't even deal with his own party. It cast serious doubton his ability as a leader and made him look politically weak. There's no better way to remind the world you're president than bombing another country. Anyone who questioned his leadership ability on healthcare will suddenly see the President doing the most presidential thing he can do - exercising American military might. This is also a great way of distracting from the probe into Trump's ties with Russia. It seems every other day a new secret meeting between a Trump campaign operative and a Russian official is uncovered, and it's looking increasingly like there was some nefarious collusion between Trump and the Russians in the 2016 election. Trump desperately needs to shirk the label of Siberian candidate. There are few better ways to demonstrate you aren't in Putin's pocket than to bomb his only Middle Eastern ally over his protestations. The President needs a win. His poll numbers are historically low; no president has ever polled so badly so early in his term. By virtually every account this has been a disastrous first 100 days. Trump recognises that he needs to change the news cycle and generate some positive coverage. This is a tried-and-true way of doing just that. This isn't meant to be a criticism of Trump's actions, but of his motives. We must do something in Syria, and it's high time we took out Assad's airfields. But if Trump really wanted to help the Syrian people, especially the children he saw gassed to death, he'd drop this abhorrent Muslim ban and open American borders to thousands of Syrian refugees. He would, like British Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott advocated on last night's BBC  Question Time , push for international sanctions on Russia until they stopped propping up the Assad regime. He would spearhead an international effort to remove Assad and defeat the so-called Islamic State by means of a UN resolution and military effort. Trump doesn't care about the Syrian people, he cares about ratings - and right now his ratings suck. Instead of congratulating him on making the right decision for the wrong reasons, we should continue pressuring him to do more to alleviate this humanitarian crisis, and that's going to take more than air strikes. Until that happens, it's hard not to view these air strikes as nothing more than a political gambit.",0

But instead of heading for a refugee camp or the ferry terminal, Khebez Dawle started chatting with the tourists basking on the beach outside the Aphrodite Hotel. ""We said hello. We were happy faces having fun. ... Usually they see scared people, sad faces, children landing,"" said lead singer Anas Maghrebi. ""It was surreal for us and for them, and we wanted to make it more surreal so we whipped out the copies of the CDs from our bags and we started distributing the CDs on the beach."" Read more Why the world's refugees should be given international passports From the moment the boys in the band set foot in Europe, they have been trying to change what people think when they hear the words ""Syrian refugees."" They had another chance Wednesday night in Zagreb, where they were invited to play a gig that capped their 1,700-kilometer (1,050-mile) trek to Croatia. Hundreds came to listen. ""We have a voice. Maybe other Syrian people don't have a voice to tell their story,"" Maghrebi told the Associated Press before the concert. ""It's our responsibility to tell our story and their story. Syrian people are civilized people. They have a heritage. It's a developed nation. Most of us are educated."" The band's story begins in Damascus in 2010 when Maghrebi, now 25, and his friends started listening to groups like like Pink Floyd while at university. They dreamed rocker dreams. They rehearsed in a basement, but never dared to ask permission to perform in public. That would have required approval from the authorities, and the police wouldn't have liked their lyrics. ""You killed me, then you blamed me because I spoke,"" the band sings in one of the tracks on their CD. Then came the Arab Spring in 2011. Band members sided with demonstrators calling for more freedom of expression, and one of their members became very involved. ""He was really active,"" Maghrebi said. ""He believed in it."" In May 2012, the drummer was found dead.

They fled to Lebanon with many of their countrymen. Most refugees aren't allowed to work in Lebanon, but the band got help from a leading local artist. They cut a record, performed in clubs. But like many other Syrians, they realized they couldn't stay - their lives might slip away while they waited for the war to end. They sold equipment in Lebanon to earn the money for passage to Europe. After traveling overland from Damascus to the Turkish coast, they paid a smuggler $1,200 each for a place in the inflatable dinghy that carried them 10 kilometers (six miles) to Lesbos and the European Union. They packed clothes and CDs in their backpacks and bought two small instruments, a harmonica and a melodica, for the journey. They left the guitars behind. They counted themselves lucky to have only 16 people in their dinghy. So many others get overcrowded with dozens of people, and sink. In Lesbos, the indie rockers charmed the sunbathers with their music, but it was time to move on. They started walking, through Greece, Macedonia and Serbia. As tensions rose along the Serbian-Hungarian border, they decided to try an alternate route through Croatia - even though few were taking that path at the time. They walked through vineyards in the dark, not realizing that there were still landmines in the area as a result of the war between Croatia and Serbia in the 1990s. At the border town of Ilok, they were detained by perplexed police officers who had never seen a group of Syrians before. ""We got really friendly with them,"" said Maghrebi as he chain-smoked. ""There was a lot of interesting and intense (conversation) inside the police station about music and how it unites people. ... One of them was a rocker. He used to play drums."" Now they are in Zagreb, performing, spreading the word. Most important they are sharing the journey of their people, the hundreds who traveled alongside them. ""This journey. It's one of a kind. You may have it once in a lifetime,"" Maghrebi told The Associated Press before their gig. ""We decided to go through what our people are going through. We're not different."" Rock fans seemed to respond to the experience, too. At the Mocvara Club gig, people came even though they had never heard of them. The Arabic lyrics were a mystery, but the anti-oppression, anti-dictatorship message was embraced by the crowd, with a bit of explanation before the songs. Some 200 people came to offer support, particularly given Croatia's recent experience with war. ""We have a lot of empathy for refugees,"" said Robert Bernat, 33, who just wanted to be there out of sympathy for those suffering in the war in Syria. The band has been overwhelmed by the generosity of people. Volunteers who had no stake in their journey have given them places to stay. The club in Zagreb lent them its drum set. And on and on. ""You learn a lot about humans, about borders. You lose your faith in papers and passports and ID cards and border and nationalities,"" Maghrebi said. ""Your belief in humans grows stronger -way stronger."" The concept of sharing is also embedded in their name. Khebez Dawle means state bread, a reference to the subsidized bread that is a symbol of people's dependence on state power in Syria. The band took the name to show that man does not live on bread alone; that a stable government must also permit freedom of expression and social engagement. ""We are the bread that builds the government, not this loaf in our hands,"" Maghrebi said. ""This was a big discovery actually."" Maghrebi wants to share what he's learned. He wants to live the moment, pass it on. ""Mainly, I hope we can speak for the people who have no voice in Syria,"" he said. ""They are still there between Assad bombs ... and ISIS knives, peaceful people in the middle of an international battlefield. ""Syria is an international battlefield."" Associated Press",1

Cem Isik, Turkey's deputy ambassador to Britain, said the country being barred from the EU had contributed to the international migration problems. The country has been an official candidate for EU membership since 1999, with negotiations about accession launched in 2005 - but progress has been very slow. ""Turkey joining the European Union is a strategic objective - it's being going on for decades,"" Mr Isik told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""For years the EU was reluctant to take on Turkey as a member state because it didn't want problems relating to Iraq and Syria at its border - now you can see how short-sighted that was."" Mr Isik was asked whether Turkey was blackmailing Europe into letting it join the EU. He said: ""Turkey is not blackmailing Europe but it's disheartening to see that Europe only remembered Turkey after the migrant crisis last summer."" Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan has been accused of having authoritarian tendencies Millions of refugees and migrants are passing through Turkey, which has opened its southern border with Syria for humanitarian purposes. Turkey has allowed refugees to transit through its territory to move towards Europe - with president Erdogan last month threatening to use buses to send more people to the EU. Sitting on the edge of the Syrian conflict zone, the country home to three million refuges but says aid promised by the EU to help care for them has not yet materialised. The latest call to join comes amid an outcry in Europe over a crackdown on press freedom by the country's Government which is expected to delay accession even further. This weekend the European Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said Turkey was jepordising its future in the EU with the authoritarian policy. Martin Schulz, the European Parliament President, also warned that the Government takeover of the Zaman opposition newspaper was ""yet another blow to press freedom"" in the region. The deputy ambassador however defended his Government's actions. ""When you look at who is in prison for whatever purposes you will see there are people in there for murder, people in there for espionage,"" he said. A map showing the movement of refugees from Syria towards Turkey's border Long-standing roadblocks to Turkey's accession include refusing to recognise the Republic of Cyprus, which is an EU member state, poor relations with Greece, and the consistent opposition of Germany. The strong role the army plays in the country's constitution and the fact most of the country is in Asia has also been subject a subject of concern. Britain has however long supported Turkey accession to the EU. In 2010 David Cameron said he was ""angry"" at the slow pace of negotiations. ""A European Union without Turkey at its heart is not stronger but weaker... not more secure but less... not richer but poorer,"" he said at the time. The previous Labour government also backed Turkish accession. Turkey has a fast growing population of 75 million, making it almost as large as Germany and bigger than Britain or France. It would be the second largest EU member state and likely shift the balance of power in Europe.",1

Read more Russia and Norway in battle to repeatedly reject the same refugees Ministers are now under mounting pressure to reform the rules, potentially opening the doors to thousands more vulnerable Syrians. Labour's Yvette Cooper and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron are among MPs backing an amendment to the Government's Immigration Bill, which goes before MPs on 1 December, which would see the right of reunion extended to successful asylum seekers' dependent parents and grandparents, children over 18 and in some cases siblings. MPs backing the amendment have pointed to harrowing cases, highlighted by the British Red Cross, of families torn apart by existing asylum rules. In one case two Syrian brothers have been unable to bring their mother to the UK, leaving her alone and without any family support in a refugee camp in Iraq. Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour's refugee taskforce, backs the amendment to the Immigration Bill (Getty) In another, a family with three daughters have had to leave the eldest, who is 19, behind in Syria at the mercy of trafficking gangs and with no legal route to join her family. Although it is thought unlikely to pass in the Commons tomorrow, there are hopes the amendment to the Immigration Bill could succeed in the House of Lords, where the Government lacks a majority. If the amendment is passed, it could potentially open the doors to thousands more Syrian refugees, above and beyond the 20,000 the Government has pledged to resettle by 2020. However, the Home Office declined to speculate on the Government's response to any change in the law ahead of the debate on 1 December. The 20,000 Syrians currently due to arrive includes family members of original applicants who are permitted to join them under the current rules.  Ms Cooper, chair of Labour's refugee taskforce, said that asylum rules in both Britain and Europe were not working.

""We should be doing more to allow families who have been driven from their homes by war, violence and persecution to be reunited in a place of sanctuary. ""As the winter closes in and we start turning our attention to Christmas, I hope the Government will take action to support those refugee families who have been torn apart by conflict to be reunited.""

The president's order banned travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. However, Syrian refugees would be barred indefinitely. Three appellate judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco considered the fate of Trump's temporary travel ban, four days after it was blocked by a federal judge in Seattle. The three judges presiding over the case are William C Canby Jr, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland who was appointed by President Barack Obama. In one exchange, Judge Friedland asked Justice Department lawyer August Flentje if the government could provided any evidence connecting the seven banned countries to terrorism. He responded by saying, ""these proceedingshave been moving very fast.""

3023,src_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,8/3/2016,602 words,DEAN KIRBY,Young migrants with legal right to be in the UK 'face fear and hostility'; Refugee crisis,Broadsheet,"The reality faced by young migrant men arriving in the UK, often after arduous journeys of thousands of miles, is that Britain in 2016 is a far cry from the land of their dreams. A study by experts at the University of Manchester which forms part of a European Commission report on migration has found that the hopes of young migrants arriving here are all too quickly shattered. While new arrivals want to work hard, start a family, play sport and lead an active social life, many face exclusion and hostility at work, in sports grounds and nightclubs, and also find themselves being unfairly treated by the public and the authorities. Researchers are now calling for a national effort to help integrate these men into British society so that they no longer feel like second class citizens and can start reaching their full potential for the benefit of the UK economy. ""The majority of the young men we spoke to said they felt fear of victimisation or racism because they feel like second class citizens,"" said Jon Spencer, from the university's Centre for Criminology and Criminal Justice, who led the study. ""When interviewed, they told us that a lot of their social interactions were awkward and made them feel insecure or had the potential to cause conflict or in some cases violence."" More than one in 10 people in Britain are estimated to be foreign-born, with India, Poland, Pakistan and Ireland traditionally among the biggest sources of new arrivals. The Syrian refugee crisis has focused the public's minds on immigration, with David Cameron announcing this week that Royal Navy warships will join Nato forces in intercepting people trying to reach Europe from Turkey. Immigration is also a key battleground at the heart of the EU referendum, with John Whittingdale, the culture secretary, warning Mr Cameron that he must release the figures showing the ""true number"" of EU migrants in Britain, amid claims that public services are ""creaking at the seams"". Researchers believe that a negative portrayal of migrants by politicians and the media could be making it difficult for those with legitimate rights of residence to settle, with many feeling they are constantly having to justify their status. The European Commission study involved in-depth interviews with more than 280 migrants aged 16 to 27 in seven countries across Europe, including the UK. ""The young men we interviewed had a right of residence and aren't illegal immigrants, yet society in general isn't making them feel welcome,"" Mr Spencer said. ""They feel they are constantly having to justify their status and are made to feel like they don't belong here. Many we spoke to told us that they feel as if they are on the wrong side of the law, even if they've done nothing wrong. ""The perception seems to be that these young men are automatically seen at risk of engaging in criminal activity."" The researchers say it is vital that national policies are drawn up to help these men to belong and play a part in society and the economy. ""Feeling accepted and part of society is crucial to a young man's sense of wellbeing and can determine the quality of their present and future outlook,"" Mr Simpson said. ""There needs to be a national effort to help integrate these men and give them a sense of security. If people can feel they are members of society, it builds citizenship. ""It should be driven nationally and delivered locally, with migrant community organisations involved in creating educational strategies and developing language skills. ""These are young men who have an absolute right to be here and want to work, but they don't feel part of society.""",1

Our Government can only talk in numbers, so too most of the media, including the BBC. Until yesterday, when Yvette Cooper finally acknowledged the Syrian refugee crisis, leading Labour figures were cowardly too, staying silent. Social psychopathy is the result. Thousands perish as they try to get into Europe; asylum-seeking women miscarry on the streets; children are starving and traumatised; young men look trapped and emasculated. Those who have decided not to care will not be moved. (Millions do care and do what little they can, but this is a humanitarian disaster which requires a pan-European response). Maybe this is the moment, the image which breaks through the emotional and political fortresses. Remember that little naked, burning girl in the Vietnam war running away from bomb attacks? That single picture turned American public opinion against that terrible war. Or the first photographs of young Malala Yousafzai after she was shot on a school bus? Until then most Pakistanis were in denial about the Taliban in their country. After the shooting they had nowhere to hide. Look at the picture of the washed up toddler if you can bear to. He is a little person, an innocent, who died before he could grow. Think of the chances his parents took and why they felt they had no other choice. How frightened they must have been when they got on to the packed, unsafe boat. Did they drown too? They might have seen their child sink. Imagine that. If they survived, they must wish they hadn't. We don't know their names. Maybe we never will. But this is our child now, whoever we are. Even those who support hardline anti-immigration policies, must, I think, feel pity and some urge to help.

But when he saw men with bushy long beards at a mosque near his current home in Cologne last November, he was worried. The men's appearance reminded him of Jaish al-Islam, the Islamist rebels who took over his hometown near Damascus, said Salam, 36, who wears a moustache but no beard. One of them told Salam that ""good Muslims grow beards, not moustaches,"" he recalled - a centuries-old idea that he dismisses. ""Everything about this mosque made me feel uneasy,"" he said. Syrians in Germany say many of the country's Arab mosques are more conservative than those at home. Over two months, a dozen Syrians in six places of worship in three cities told Reuters they were uncomfortable with very conservative messages in Arabic-speaking mosques. People have criticised the way the newcomers dress and practise their religion, they said. Some insisted the Koran be interpreted word-for-word. Muslims bow their headsduring Friday prayers at the Turkish Kuba Camii mosque(Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters) It is a highly contentious issue in a country where Europe's migrant influx is already having deep political and social consequences. In Germany this year Alternative for Germany, a populist party that says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, has gained ground. There have been several attacks by militant Muslims. Syrians and others say the mosque problem is adding to mistrust. In Germany, other different faiths are traditionally supported by the state. But most of the country's four million Muslims originally came from Turkey and attend Turkish-speaking mosques which are partly funded by Ankara. Last year around 890,000 asylum-seekers, more than 70 percent of them Muslims, entered the country. Around a third came from Syria. Many of them do not want to go to Turkish mosques because they do not understand the sermons. They prefer to worship where people speak Arabic.

They are often short of funds, or else supported by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Some back ultra-conservative or highly literal interpretations of Islam, such as Wahhabism or Salafism. ""Unfortunately it is true that a large majority of Arabic-speaking mosques are more conservative than Turkish mosques,"" said Professor Mouhannad Khorchide, who heads the Centre for Islamic Theology at Muenster University. That poses problems for integrating those who are less conservative. ""How can one absorb these people if they are interested in their religion?"" said Khorchide. ""When there is a shortage of offers the Salafists try to fill the gap."" In Cologne, Salam said that 75 Syrians live in the same hotel as his family. Of them, only one veiled woman prays at the nearest Arabic mosque. ""One time when I was there, a Salafist asked a young Arab man to leave because he was wearing shorts,"" he added. ""At the Turkish mosque no one cares what you're wearing.""

They had interrupted the sermon, which he said was forbidden. ""Your Friday is gone!"" he told them, lifting his hands toward his face and pressing his fingers together to emphasise that their actions had made their prayers void. The imam who led the prayers said the community is not political or violent. Asked about the Syrians who felt uncomfortable at mosques like his, he said: ""It's an honour to be called a Salafist. We are only interested in giving members of our community pure Islamic teachings."" Even though Salam can't understand the sermons in Turkish, he said he has started going to a Turkish mosque instead. A 2008 survey of Muslims and Christians in Europe by the state-funded WZB Berlin Social Science Centre found fundamentalist attitudes were less prevalent among German Muslims than elsewhere in Europe, but still quite widespread: For example, nearly half the Muslims it surveyed in Germany felt religious law to be more important than secular law. Germany's domestic intelligence agency has recorded more than 320 attempts by Salafist Muslims to contact refugees last year, often by offering food, clothes, free copies of the Koran and help with German to asylum seekers living in shelters. Earlier this month, a Syrian committed suicide in prison after he was arrested on suspicion of planning to bomb an airport. His brother and friends in Germany have said he was ""brainwashed"" by ultra-conservative imams in Berlin. The intelligence agency has advised local authorities against housing asylum-seekers near Salafist or Wahhabi mosques. ""We know of at least 90 Islamist mosques where activities aimed at refugees are taking place. These mosques are largely Arab-dominated and influenced by Salafism,"" said Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the agency. At the al-Nur mosque in Berlin, which is run by Wahhabis, Syrian Abed al-Hafian said he was alarmed by a strict interpretation of the Koran and Hadith, a collection of sayings of the prophet. He recalled a sentence from Hadith that the preacher quoted on his first Friday: 'Every novelty (in religion) is innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance leads to the hellfire.' ""I had never heard that sentence in Syria,"" said the 42-year-old father of three, who arrived in 2014. ""The message is clear and is directed at us Muslims: 'Don't you dare interpret your religion. Take the Koran word for word.' It's a problem."" He said he decided to take what he wants from the sermons and ""ignore the rest."" Even though officials accept that not all Salafists are violent, some Syrians worry that if they go to Arabic-speaking mosques, they may be seen as radicals. In Hamburg, Syrian Kurd Abu Mohammad said he has avoided going to a mosque since he arrived in Germany two years ago because his parents, who came here a decade ago, told him it could only bring trouble. ""The government is obviously monitoring Salafists,"" said the 32-year-old father of six, using a nickname because he said he fears for his safety and that of relatives still living in Damascus. ""I have a two-year visa and the last thing I want is trouble."" The problem may be rooted in the schisms in Islam, but it is made worse by the structure of religious funding in Germany. Since the start of the 20th century Germany has had a system of collecting taxes for worship, which are then paid out to religious groups like Catholics, Protestants and Jews. Muslims cannot benefit from this, because the four main organisations that represent Muslims in Germany can't agree to merge into one religious body, a requirement to receive taxes. ""Most communities can't even afford a proper mosque ... And most can't pay a well-educated imam to serve their community,"" said Daniel Abdin, co-chairman of the Shura Council in Hamburg, an umbrella organisation for the city's Muslim community. ""So you end up with a situation where people with little or no knowledge of modern theology are serving as imams."" Five years ago, the government set up five Islamic theology centres to train imams and Islamic educators with a 20-million-euro ($22 million) grant from the Education Ministry. The strategy has been partly successful: Islamic studies are taught to Muslim pupils in many schools. But few of the more than 1,800 students who have graduated from the theology centres have gone on to serve as local imams. Nonetheless, Khorchide and other Islam experts are hopeful that the influx of Muslim asylum-seekers with an open approach to religion is an opportunity to promote a more ""moderate"" Islam in the Arabic-speaking mosques. In Hamburg, Abu Mohammad says he has stopped attending mosque at all. ""I pray at home,"" he said. ""I'm sure Allah listens."" Reuters",0

In the summer of 2011, there were 5,000 refugees in Lebanon. Most had moved in with family members, some were staying in mosques or abandoned schools. That their stay would be temporary was unquestionable at the time. But it was not to be. At al-Ibna school in Wadi Khaled, where 85 people were living, the sign outside had the word ""refugees"" scribbled out with a key and replaced with ""visitors"". Now Lebanon is hosting over a million refugees. By the end of the year, the UN expects the number to hit 1.6 million. That means Lebanon's population of four million will have swelled by almost 40 per cent. Three years after the start of the conflict, there are more than nine million people; almost half of Syria's population, on the move. More than 2.5 million Syrians have streamed across Syria's borders into Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. The UN predicts that if the conflict continues, Syrians will become the largest refugee population in the world. A map of Lebanon that uses red dots to indicate where Syrian refugees have settled down is a sea of red. And Lebanon's infrastructure was already straining to supply water and electricity before the tidal wave of refugees hit. Official camps are still banned; the myriad of tents along the roads are referred to as informal tented settlements. The refugees often live in cramped conditions, with up to a dozen people sharing a single room or tent. Medical concerns are rife. The first suspected case of polio among refugees in Lebanon was detected this week. Many new arrivals have been displaced multiple times within Syria before deciding to leave. ""We were displaced four times before we came here,"" says Abu Uday, a soldier who defected and moved his family to Lebanon last month. Every time they would move, the bombing would follow them. The family of five now live in a brightly coloured container, part of a new informal settlement in the no-man's-land between Syria and Lebanon, outside of Arsal. That border town has tripled in size because of the refugees and is full. ""I don't know who is right anymore, the regime or the rebels,"" his wife says. Throughout the region, Syrians are streaming across the border. In Jordan, Zaatari camp with its 100,000 inhabitants is the second-largest refugee camp in the world and the kingdom's de facto fourth-biggest city. ""It's a temporary city,"" says its ""mayor"", UNHCR's Kilian Kleinschmidt, of the sprawling construction in the desert. But how temporary, nobody knows. The camp started out as just tents; now longer-term residents live in containers and people have even built gardens with fountains. The main shopping street is called the Champs-Élysées ; there are over 2,500 shops in the camp, including cafés, wedding-dress rental shops and even a nightclub. Although Jordan has curtailed its borders, more refugees keep coming. Azraq camp, which will able to accommodate 130,000 people, will open on 30 April. The site, situated in the middle of the desert 60 miles east of Amman, has newly paved roads, a police station, two schools and a hospital and families will live in containers. The UN has called the opening ""timely"" as 600 Syrians are entering Jordan daily. The country is already hosting almost 585,000 refugees; 80 per cent live outside of the camps, mostly in urban areas throughout the country. In Iraq, which is experiencing its own uptick in violence, there are 225,000 Syrian refugees. Turkey, where the government has taken sole responsibility for the camps, has more than 630,000. Most refugees settle in an urban environment. The work that is available to them is mostly of the manual, badly paid kind. Professionals often find themselves barred from practising their profession. For example, the medical syndicate in Lebanon has closed ranks and charges an admission fee of over £200,000 to Syrians. As the conflict continues and their savings run out, a growing number of refugees are forced to rely on aid for their survival. But the regional Syria appeal, which at over £2.5bn is the largest in UN history, has only been funded 14 per cent for 2014. UNHCR has had to cut off a third of its beneficiaries in Lebanon over the past year, at least in part due to funding constraints. Yet over the past three years, refugees from across the country have been united in one thing. Their dream is to return to Syria, no matter how little remains of the life they used to lead there.",1

Syria's richer Gulf neighbours have been accused of not doing their fair share in the humanitarian crisis, with Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the UAE also keeping their doors firmly shut to asylum-seekers. According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which quoted a report in the Lebanese newspaper Al Diyar, Saudi Arabia would build one mosque for every 100 refugees who entered Germany in extraordinary numbers last weekend. It would be unfair to suggest that the Gulf Arab states have done nothing to help the estimated four million Syrians who have fled their country since the start of the conflict in 2011. Just this week, the al Hayat newspaper reported that 500,000 Syrians had found homes in Saudi Arabia since the civil war began - as workers, not refugees. There have also been significant contributions from rich individuals towards the upkeep of refugee camps round the Syrian border, estimated by the BBC to total around $900 million (£600 million). The refugee crisis - in pictures But amid a history of competition between the Gulf states and Iranian-allied nations, there is a deep fear that allowing an influx of Syrian refugees could also let in Syrians loyal to Bashar al-Assad. There also exists a more general concern about demographic change, leaving the states opposed to the idea of welcoming refugees.

Russia said its latest wave of raids targeted fighters associated with Isis in Idlib and Aleppo provinces, although the group has little presence in those areas. Russia's defence ministry had claimed on Friday to have killed 100 fighters, including two Isisfield commanders, in a strike on an ammunition depot near Aleppo.

Earlier today, the Prime Minister insisted the Government was doing enough already to help refugees, but indicated that the number due to be accepted by Britain was ""under review"". Signalling that an announcement was imminent, a Number 10 spokeswoman told The Independent: ""When we say we're keeping the situation under review, you can take that to mean there will be action."" The refugee crisis - in pictures An announcement - possibly involving Britain accepting more than a thousand refugees from UNHCR camps on the border of Syria - is expected within the next 24 hours. The details will be closely scrutinised by refugee charities which have urged the UK to welcome tens of thousands of homeless Syrians. It is understood that the Government is concerned that accepting a large number of Syrian refugees who are already in Europe would make the crisis worse, by encouraging more people to make the dangerous journey from the Middle East to the continent.  The Independent can also reveal that the British Red Cross is launching a major appeal for donations, after it was inundated with offers of support from members of the public desperate appalled by the images of the tiny body of Aylan Kurdi. Aylan was drowned at sea along with his five-year-old brother Galip and mother Rihan. Their dinghy capsized on route to the Greek island of Kos, where they were trying to find safety after fleeing the war-torn Syrian city of Kobani. Mass demonstrations are planned across the country this weekend and thousands of people have posted images on social media of themselves holding a ""refugees welcome"" placard. Boris Johnson said it was Britain's ""moral responsibility"" to take those fleeing persecution while significant number of backbench MPs came out to criticise the Government's stance. Privately some ministers said they had been lobbying behind the scenes to get the Prime Minister to change his mind. The Government has faced criticism from other European capitals over its failure to accept Britain's ""fair share"" of up to 160,000 refugees who are set to be re-settled under an emergency EU scheme. Ministers have also refused to join a UN programme for resettling the most vulnerable refugees, instead setting up its own programme that has admitted just 216 vulnerable Syrians over the past year. By contrast, Germany has accepted 35,000 Syrians through the UN programme, Canada more than 10,000, Australia 5,600 and Switzerland 3,500. Nils Muinieks, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, said: ""I am seriously concerned by the British Prime Minister's position that the UK should not provide protection to more refugees from the Middle East,"" he said ""The truth is that at the moment the UK is doing much less than other European countries."" European Council president Donald Tusk, seen as an ally of Mr Cameron, upped the pressure by arguing that ""all EU members"" needed to take their share of refugees. Reports from Brussels suggested that, under a proposed new EU-wide new deal, any members states that refused to accept their fair share of refugees would have to make a financial contribution. Chancellor George Osborne was sent out to say the that number of refugees Britain takes is ""under review"". Earlier Mr Cameron himself refused to say whether Britain would increase the number of refugees, saying that he ""deeply moved"" by the images of Aylan Kurdi and that Britain would fulfil its ""moral responsibilities."" A significant number of Mr Cameron's own backbenchers came out to implicitly criticise his response so far. Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative MP who sits on the Downing Street policy board, said the image of a dead three-year-old being washed up on European shores was a source of ""shame"". Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman said that Britain should be willing to accommodate up to 10,000 refugees. Writing on The Independent's website Jeremy Corbyn, the frontrunner in the Labour leadership race, accused Mr Cameron of ""cowardice"". ""The politicians who pander to prejudice by warning of being 'swamped' or of the coming 'swarm' offer no solutions,"" he wrote.

The full horror of the human tragedy unfolding on the shore of Europe prompted a groundswell of public pressure and grassroots offers of help, ranging from spare rooms from grandmothers in the West Country to volunteers taking essential humanitarian supplies to Calais. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of Save the Children, said: ""The Independent's campaign is a timely and important intervention. Britain has a proud history of welcoming refugees in the most desperate times and we need to do so again now."" Save the Children has called for Government to back its ""five point plan"" to avert further tragedies. It calls for a regional response to the tragedy, a major search and rescue operation by the Royal Navy, more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers into Europe, proper reception centres to sort asylum seekers from economic migrants and a major Europe-wide resettlement programme.

3292,src_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,1/12/2015,428 words,CHARLIE COOPER WHITEHALL CORRESPONDENT,Coalition of MPs want relatives of refugees to get asylum; EXCLUSIVE,Broadsheet,"Thousands more elderly relatives, grown-up children and brothers and sisters of refugees resettled in the UK could be granted the right to rejoin their families under a proposed change to the law backed by a cross-party coalition of MPs. Asylum rules on family reunion currently mean refugees who are granted asylum can only bring children under 18 and spouses with them, and will affect the 20,000 Syrian refugees due to arrive in the UK in the next five years. Ministers are now under mounting pressure to reform the rules, potentially opening the doors to thousands more vulnerable Syrians. Labour's Yvette Cooper and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron are among MPs backing an amendment to the Government's Immigration Bill, which goes before MPs today, which would see the right of reunion extended to successful asylum-seekers' dependent parents and grandparents, children over 18 and, in some cases, siblings. MPs backing the amendment have pointed to harrowing cases, highlighted by the British Red Cross, of families torn apart by existing asylum rules. In one case, two Syrian brothers have been unable to bring their mother to the UK, leaving her alone in a refugee camp in Iraq. In another, a family with three daughters have had to leave the eldest, who is 19, behind in Syria at the mercy of trafficking gangs and with no legal route to join her family. Although it is thought unlikely to pass in the Commons vote, there are hopes the amendment to the Immigration Bill could succeed in the House of Lords, where the Government's peers are not in the majority. However, the Home Office declined to speculate on the Government's response to any change in the law ahead of today's debate. The 20,000 Syrians currently due to arrive between now and 2020 includes family members of original applicants who are permitted to join them under the current rules. Ms Cooper, chair of Labour's refugee taskforce, said: ""As the winter closes in and we start turning our attention to Christmas, I hope the Government will take action to support those refugee families, who have been torn apart by conflict, to be reunited."" Mr Farron said existing reunion rules were ""far too narrow"" and called on Conservative MPs to back the amendment, which is also supported by the SNP and the Green Party. ""When you are fleeing for your life and making a journey to safety you can become separated from your family."" Mr Farron added: ""The Government recognises that families who find themselves in this situation deserve to be reunited, which is why there are reunion rules already in place.""",1

However his choice of photos drew a divided response from Twitter users. Some appreciated the All Black's efforts to raise awareness and show ""relevant and important"" pictures, while others criticised him for not including a trigger warning and reminded him young people can access Twitter. Additionally, a spokesperson for Unicef - the organisation who Williams accompanied on his recent trip - also criticised the sharing of the photos.

Turkey is home to 2.2 million refugees. The agreement requires Turkey to crack down on people smugglers and co-operate with the EU on the return of migrants who do not qualify as refugees. The money is intended to raise the living standards of Syrian refugees in Turkey, and so persuade more of them to stay put rather than attempt perilous crossings to the EU via the Greek islands. The final offer of ""an initial"" (EURO)3 billion represents a compromise between the EU, which offered that sum over two years, andTurkey, which wanted it every year. Now the money, as French President Francois Hollande said, will be paid out bit by bit as conditions are met, leaving the total payout unclear. ""AsTurkeyis making an effort to take in refugees -- who will not come to Europe -- it's reasonable thatTurkeyreceive help from Europe to accommodate those refugees,"" Hollande told reporters.

The schools said the ban threatened their ability to attract international students and academics they needed to ""meet their goals of educating tomorrow's leaders from around the world"".

The order stopped Syrian refugees from entering the country indefinitely and immediately halted the US Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days. Following widespread outrage, the government amended the order to allow citizens to enter if they possessed a green card. The universities wrote in ajoint statement: ""By prohibiting persons from freely travelling to and from this country, the executive order divides students and their families, impairs the ability of American universities to draw the finest international talent, and inhibits the free exchange of ideas."" On Thursday, US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's ruling blocking enforcement of the order. The Trump administration has indicated it will fight the decision. Despite the block on the travel ban, the schools said it hadalready had a negative effect and argued the potential for harm continued. ""While the Executive Order is currently limited to seven countries, its damaging effects have already been widely felt by American universities,"" the schools said in their friend-of-the-court brief.

The club was officially founded in 1910 when land was leased by to the pond for people to bathe nude or partially clothed, before it expanded in the 20s with larger grounds, shelters and sports facilities.

But as attitudes have hardened following the Cologne New Year's Eve attacks and other reported assaults, support has risen for populist parties and far-right groups including the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Reports of sexual harassment and attacks by asylum seekers at swimming pools have generated controversy across Europe, sparking a ban on male migrants at one pool in Germany and ""vigilante"" patrols in Sweden.

The clean energy is due to be expanded to the 36,000 refugees living in the camp in Jordan's barren northern desert by early next year. For the past two and a half years, refugees living in Azraq were reliant on portable solar lanterns to light their homesand had no means of preserving food or cooling their shelters in the extreme desert heat. Electricity was first introduced in January and changed the way of lifein the camp. Fatima, a 52-year-old single mother from rural Damascus, who has lived in the camp since 2015 with her two adult sons, said electricity in the camp had enabled her family to preserveleftover food, have a cold glass of water and continue daily activities after sunset. ""In Syria we were used to a particular lifestyle, and then we were disconnected from it when we became refugees. For someone who is used to having electricity, you cannot imagine how difficult it is to live without it,"" she said.

Soon, however, President Erdogan delivered a live FaceTime address to the nation, calling on people to take to the streets to overturn the coup and defend democracy. The result left 265 dead, 1,440 wounded and the return of Erdogan's democratically-elected government. This reads like a people's success story: unlike the jubilant crowds that met the tanks in Turkey's 1960, 1971and 1980 coups, this time, the Turkish public responded with a firm ""no"". Turkey's opposition parties - usually vehemently opposed to Erdogan's AK Party - hurriedly rallied to denounce the coup attempt and state their commitment to democracy on Saturday. Many international heads of state, the UN, and NATO called for the continuation of Turkey'sdemocratically elected government. The people's will had triumphed over militarism. But while the Turkish government congratulates itself and its loyal 51 per cent for a historical night of defending democracy, this feels far from a victory for Turkey's secular and minority groups.

Ithas now long been the case in Turkey that, when the word ""democracy"" is used by the state, the calling card is coming out: it directly means their sustained electoral majority, and this justifies whatever is next to come. Democracy has become shorthand for a majority with homogenous values having the right to decide the fate of a diverse and increasingly demoralised minority. Yesterday's show of democracy was therefore not only questionable in label, but its aftermath looks set to be, too. The government's heavy-handed clampdown has already begun. A remarkable 2,839 army members, and 2,745 judges and prosecutors have been detained within 24 hours: assuming all arrests are based on solid impartial evidence, it is an intelligence feat of astounding accuracy and speed, which Turkey's recent failures to detect terrorist plots suggests unlikely. The sheer numbers bear the hallmarks of a purge, as any unlawful arrests fall through the cracks. Erdogan has also regained some international sympathy, while bolstering a domestic support base that had temporarily waned due to tensions about Syrian refugees. The frightening violence of Erdogan's supporters in their so-called care-taking of democracy on Friday night; the rhetoric of democracy and majoritarianism that Erdogan uses interchangeably with no qualms; and the pursuit of vengeance over mercy in the aftermath marks this failed coup as the start of darker days for Turkish democracy.",0

Police said on Thursday they had arrested Amedeo Mancini, 38, on suspicion of murder motivated by racism. The suspect's lawyer told AGI news agency the circumstances of the incident had not been fully established. Friends of Mancini claim he was forced to fight back becauseEmmanuel Chidi tried to attack him after his wife was insulted, according to some Italian news reports.

The former Formula 1 champion is currently fighting for his life in hospital in France, where he lies in a medically-induced coma after suffering a critical head injury following a skiing accident.

See the images from that below. Moving scenes as fans hold silent vigil for Michael Schumacher's 45th birthday Needless to say, these comments are likely to be about as popular as... Being a member of the BNP must be.

Griffin himself declared today a ""good day"", as his status as officially bankrupt has washed away all his debt concerns. Darby went on to praise Griffin for being ""brave"" and for taking it all ""on the chin for the party"". Griffin racked up towering debts after a dispute with a legal firm over professional negligence. And professional negligence today reminds us again of one person, Simon Darby, who blew his own metaphorical trumpet for the tough morning of fielding press calls he recently endured.

The attorneys-general of Washington and Minnesota have claimed Mr Trump acted in ""bad faith in an effort to target Muslims"" in signing his executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. During an hour of oral arguments, they pulled quotes from his December 2015 call for a ""total and complete shutdown"" on Muslims entering the US as well as an interview he gave to a Christian network when he said he wanted to give priority to Christians in Syria.

It comes after former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani revealed that Mr Trump had asked him to investigate ""the right way"" to legally construct a ""Muslim ban"".In an interview with Fox News, Mr Giuliani, currently the White House cyber security advisor, added: ""We focused on-instead of religion-danger. The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis.Perfectly legal. Perfectly sensible."" The administration's legal team said Washington and Minnesota were asking the court to ""take the extraordinary step of second-guessing a formal national security judgement made by the President himself"". Mr Trump has criticised what he has labelled the ""so-called"" judge who ruled the ban unlawful. Hesaid the decision ""takes law enforcement away from our country"" and would allow ""many very bad and dangerous people"" into the US. The President's order banned travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days. However, Syrian refugees would be barred indefinitely. Three appellate judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco considered the fate of the banon Tuesday, four days after it was blocked by a federal judge in Seattle. The three judges presiding over the case are William C Canby Jr, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, who was appointed by President George W Bush; and Judge Michelle Taryn Friedland who was appointed by President Barack Obama.

But for the Syrians who have escaped the country - the 2.7 million in Turkey, more than one million each to Lebanon and Europe and beyond - the turmoil and human tragedy will continue. For to be associated with the revolution in any way, as aid worker, teacher, doctor, activist, or journalist, means you can never go home. Refugees fleeing Isis rule can no more go back to government areas than vice versa, and so goes the muddy complexity of this horrific civil war. What would refugees be going back to? Much of eastern Aleppo (and Homs) has been reduced to acres and acres of rubble lying in piles and piles of dust. Reports of children stuck alive under rubble, and of 82 men and women shot in their houses by government forces, are yet more war crimes to add to a long list with a UN spokesman calling it a ""complete meltdown of humanity"". ""My name is on a list,"" has become a frequent refrain of Syrian refugees in Turkey, and given as the main reason they cannot go back - most often a government blacklist, but of course there are also Isis and al-Qaida linked-Jabhat al-Nusra (now rebranded Jabhat Fateh al-Sham) lists too. Nouriman, from Douma on the outskirts of Damascus, said she saw her house bombed in front of her eyes. She managed to salvage her cooking pots from the wreckage of her kitchen. The 46-year-old then risked her life to go back to rescue her nephews, who had been orphaned. Her son-in-law had been a photographer, and her brothers also active in the revolution. ""I could only flash my face at them,"" she told me from her sitting room in Reyhanli, on the Syrian-Turkish border, describing how she travelled with the rebels in convoys and then by bus through Syrian government checkpoints, terrified she would be recognised and arrested. Others fled with their children after defecting from the army. Mustafa Hilaq left Damascus with his children for rebel held areas and now looks forward to taking his son to school and playing badminton with him in Turkey. Radwan, 24, fled after his friend was arrested for helping internally displaced people under government controlled Aleppo - he knew he was next. He has settled and opened a computer repair shop on the Turkish border - the calm where he sees a therapist to deal with his severe anxiety. The long term consequences of integrating 2.7 million refugees in Turkey are dire, and expensive - the seemingly enormous Euro 3bn (£2.5bn) promised by the EU pales in comparison to the near Euro 20bn Turkey plans to spend annually in the coming three years on providing vital assistance. But integrating a seriously traumatised population goes far beyond basic care. The vast majority have some sort of post-traumatic stress disorder; others have lost legs or eyes, need physiotherapy or complex healthcare to treat cancer, epilepsy or diabetes. NGOs active in the area, such as the International Medical Corps - who are supported by the European Union Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (Echo) - are vital to help provide for these long-term and endemic needs. Refugees in Turkey have long known that, should Assad prevail, they cannot go home.

Ms Cox, a former aid worker, campaigned tirelessly for Syrian refugees and was a vocal supporter of the European Union and the benefits of multicultural immigration. Read more Man arrested over Labour MP killing named locally The Southern Poverty Law Centre, an established US civil rights group, has produced receipts and invoices bearing Mr Mair's name that it says are from the neo-Nazi National Alliance group. The receipts suggest Mr Mair bought $670 USD in printed material from the white supremacist group, which was until 2013 was one of the largest neo-Nazi organisations in the US. He also appears to have purchased a handbook on building improvised weapons, explosives, and incendiaries, according to the records. The documents, which date from between 1999 and 2003 show Mr Mair's name and an address in Batley, in Ms Cox's constituency. (Southern Poverty Law Centre) The Independent  reported yesterday that Mr Mair may have also had links to the ""Springbok Club"", an organisation which has defended the white supremacist apartheid regime in South Africa. That group, which says it is ""pro-free market capitalism and patriotism and anti-political correctness"", has also campaigned against the European Union.The group has condemned Ms Cox's killing. Jo Cox in the Commons, June 2015 Speculation has raged about the motive for the attack after a number of separate eyewitnesses said Ms Cox's attacker shouted ""Britain first"" - a longstanding far-right slogan - during the assault. ""Britain First"" is also the name of a far-right organisation in Britain which recently publicly advocated ""direct action"" against Muslim elected officials. The group says it condemns Ms Cox's killing. (Southern Poverty Law Centre) The attacker was also said by eyewitnesses to have used a gun of antique appearance. Eyewitnesses say Ms Cox was shot either two or three times outside her constituency advice surgery in Birstall Library. She was left lying in a pool of blood and then taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary, where she died. Eyewitness accounts from the scene paint a confused picture of events, with some reports suggesting Ms Cox intervened in a fight between two men. Others say she was directly targeted by her attacker.There has been speculation over whether Mr Mair had a history of mental health problems.

Other critics ridiculed the minister's attempt to empathise with refugees, with one quipping: ""Tonight I'll sleep with the window open to feel what it's like to be homeless."" Twitter users were also largely unimpressed by Ms Listhaug's experiment, calling it ""shameless"" and ""embarrassing"". The boat that rescued her was deployed in the Aegean last year by the Norwegian government as part of the Operation Poseidon mission run by the Frontex border agency. Describing her trip to Lesbos, the immigration minister said she also visited detention centresimplemented on the island as part of the EU-Turkey deal and met refugees. ""The conditions there are difficult and Norway is contributing as best we can to improve them,"" Ms Listhaug wrote. ""We must keep a warm heart and a cool head,"" she added, calling for a sustainable asylum policy as European nations continue to close their borders to refugees.  The Pope and Angelina Jolie are among other high profile visitors to Lesbos, which has seen the most arrivals out of any island in Europe during the refugee crisis. Under new rules implemented last month, anyone arriving clandestinely is detained and will be returned to Turkey unless they successfully apply for asylum in Greece.

The Home Secretary has been urged to rethink a £35,000 pay threshold for skilled migrant workers that could see tens of thousands of teachers, charity workers, NHS staff and tech entrepreneurs deported from Britain if they fail to make enough money. The debate was held in Westminster Hall on Monday after more than 100,000 people signed an online petition expressing anger at the measure, which Labour has called ""ill-considered, destructive and discriminatory"".

Monday's debate represented the first time MPs were given the chance to scrutinise the £35,000 threshold for non-EU workers, which was pushed through without a Commons vote as part of a raft of changes to immigration rules in 2012. If uncontested, it will come into effect next month - and campaigners say it could cost the Treasury more than £500 million in lost economic contributions.

As British MPs prepare to debate later this month whether or not the US presidential hopeful should be refused permission, Mr Trump has said any restrictions on his movement to Britain would see him withdraw millions of pounds of investment from golfing projects in Scotland. The debate in parliament comes after the billionaire presidential candidatecalled for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US. It was scheduled after more than half a million people signed a government petition. Donald Trump plans to investment hundreds of millions of dollars in resorts in Scotland In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Trump Organisation said its plans to invest a total of £700m in the billionaire's two Scottish golf resorts - Trump Turnberry in south Ayrshire and the Trump International Golf Links near Aberdeen - would be suspended if any such measure was taken. ""Any action to restrict travel would force The Trump Organisation to immediately end these and all future investments we are currently contemplating in the United Kingdom,"" it said. ""Westminster would create a dangerous precedent and send a terrible message to the world that the United Kingdom opposes free speech and has no interest in attracting inward investment.""

It added: ""Many people now agree with Mr Trump that there is a serious problem that must be resolved. This can only be achieved if we are willing to discuss these tough issues openly and honestly."" Home Secretary Theresa May will make the ultimate decision about Mr Trump Mr Trump prompted widespread condemnation last month when he suggested there should be a ""total and complete"" shutdown on Muslims entering the US to prevent terrorist attacks. He spoke out after a Muslim couple, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, attacked a health facility in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead and wounded more than 20. A poll taken at the time suggested that up to a third of Americans supported Mr Trump's proposals. More than 30 US states - the majority run by Republican governors - said they would do everything in their power to block the settlement of up to 15,000 Syrian refugees, that President Barack Obama wants to bring to the US. In the wake of the comments, David Cameron described his comments as ""divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong"" but said the billionaire should not be banned from Britain.

Very little beyond its title, which you know already (The Six Thatchers) and that John and Mary Watson (Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington) welcome their new baby daughter into the world, just as real-life partners Freeman and Abbington have let slip the news of their separation. Otherwise it's mum's the word, but Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss's juggernaut Conan Doyle reboot isn't the only crime drama returning this coming week. Here, in descending order, are the TV detectives who aren't Benedict Cumberbatch. No Offence, created and written (this opening episode at least) by Shameless's Paul Abbott, is almost as quip-heavy as Sherlock, although sadly it's difficult to see the fabulous Joanna Scanlan inspiring the sort of besotted fan-worship that follows Cumberbatch around like a cloud of pheromones. And the rest of the cast has Happy New Year written all over it - with Elaine Cassidy, Alexandra Roach, Will Mellor, Paul Ritter and, now, Sarah Solemani, all well up to the demands of Abbott's blackly humorous script. But it's Scanlan who reigns supreme as DI Vivienne Deering, the sort of lady cop who, on emerging from a shower, is quite happy to towel her lady parts while continuing a conversation with a superior officer. That commanding officer is played by Solemani - the 'her' in Him & Her - who has been introduced as a stern, by-the-book foil to Deering, as the Manchester coppers investigate a bombing at a crematorium that unearths body parts and inspires the line (from Ritter's forensics technician), that it's ""an Hieronymous Bosch job"". Better than Moffat that, I'd say. Unforgotten sees the re-teaming of Nicola Walker (Last Tango in Halifax) and Sanjeev Bhaskar (Goodness Gracious Me) as cold-case detectives DCI Cassie Stuart and DS Sunil ""Sunny"" Khan, the sort of inspired pairing that says this particular casting director deserved his or her fee. Chris Lang's creation is Waking the Dead meets Broadchurch, with one whodunit spread over six episodes, as the perfectly preserved remains of a middle-aged man are fished out of the River Lee in Essex - while, as with the first series, the investigation links various suspects who would appear to have nothing in common. Once again the support cast is a cut or two above average, including Mark Bonar, Rosie Cavaliero, Douglas Hodge and Wendy Craig. Yes, Wendy Craig. As the least likely killer, my money is on her. Silent Witness returns with a two-part storyline that is bang up to date, featuring Syrian refugees and people traffickers in Calais, but which I found a little hard to follow. If Emilia Fox's Dr Nikki Alexander barely ever cracks a smile, then that's perfectly understandable given that she spends her life poking around in chest cavities - but she could do with a bit more of Vivienne Deering's black humour. Peoplewhose jobs mean spending a lot of time with dead people tend to be on the earthy side. Those who prefer to combine murder with sunny escapism, then Death in Paradise also returns with yet another guest cast full of actors who must have looked at the rain splattering their kitchen window, peered at the shooting schedule and thought 'A few weeks in the Caribbean, flights and accommodation paid... why not?'. Death in Paradise is a joint Anglo-French production which is why, I suppose, Kris Marshall's DI Humphrey Goodman is the sort of Englishman you might find in Midsomer Norton (the French adore Midsomer Murders) - a bit woolly, a bit posh and a bit sexless. The plot involves a seismologist who dies halfway up a volcano, but I wouldn't worry yourself too much about that. Just feel the tropical breeze and dream of escape.

Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, confirmed the agreement was made unanimously on Friday afternoon. After less than an hour of discussions, the prime ministers of Finland and the Czech Republic tweeted from inside the European Council negotiations to announce that the 28 leaders had given their approval to the arrangement, which must be signed off by the Turkish Prime Minister before being implemented. UN says EU-Turkey refugee deal would violate law Authorities reported a surge in boats being sent towards the island of Lesbos as talks entered their final stages as smuggling traffic appeared to spike ahead of the expected crackdown. Mustafa Nazmi Sezgin, the governor of Dikili district, told Reuters he knew of around 300 people who had been detained in his district alone and officials in Ankara said the total number detained was around 3,000. Under the scheme drawn up by Mr Tusk and Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish Prime Minister, any migrant arriving in Greece after 20 March would be given a swift individual interview to determine whether they will be allowed to remain or sent back to Turkey. Responding to heavy criticism from international humanitarian organisations, a spokesperson for European Council President Donald Tusk said that the agreement ensured that any removals would have to be ""in full compliance with international and EU law"" and that there would be no ""collective expulsions"". The EU has agreed to safely resettle one Syrian refugee from camps in Turkey for each irregular migrant returned to the country, in a move aimed to discourage asylum seekers from paying huge sums to smugglers for treacherous sea crossings. Turkey will also be sent billions of euros and is pushing for visa liberalisation for its 75 million citizens visiting Europe, as the EU ""re-energises"" accession talks. Human Rights Watch condemned the situation as a ""new low"" and said the proposed conditions put the ""very principle of international protection for those fleeing war and persecution at stake"". The plan has also been heavily criticised for singling out Syrian refugees, who make up roughly 40 per cent of arrivals in Europe, over Iraqis, Afghans and other groups needing protection. Save the Children said that almost 90 per cent of Syrians and 80 per centof Iraqis have theirasylum application granted, making any division on the basis of nationality ""arbitrary and illegal"". The UN raised similar concerns, saying ""blanket returns"" would not be consistent with international or European law. Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen, said: ""This is a dark day for the Refugee Convention, a dark day for Europe and a dark day for humanity. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and France's President Francois Hollande attend a meeting during a European Union leaders summit on migration in Brussels, Belgium ""It's absolutely shameful to see leaders seeking to abandon their legal obligations. Forcing refugees back into the hands of the very smugglers they just came from so they can have another go at exploiting them is obviously madness. ""There's no way anyone should herald this as a solution."" The Overseas Development Institute, which has conducted research on why refugees choose to migrate, warned that the deal is ""unlikely to work"" to stop the crisis. Marta Foresti, the think-tank's Director of Governance and Security, said: ""Our research shows refugees and migrants do not make the decision to leave their home lightly, are willing to take significant risks and will not be deterred by the policies and restrictions of EU countries. ""Those excluded from the deal will continue to try different, more dangerous routes if the border between Turkey and Greece is shut to them. ""The EU has failed to provide a humane or pragmatic response to the crisis, what is now needed is leadership at the global level."" Additional reporting by agencies",1

""A woman lost her baby and her husband, another woman saw her three- or four-year-old child die and her other child rushed to hospital."" She said there had been a massive queue of rescued people - ""everyone soaked, freezing and traumatised. There are hundreds of people currently in the sea. ""Swimmers and the coastguard are out.

""We have to take responsibility to hold them to account."" Lesbos, which lies less than six miles from the Turkish coast in the north Aegean Sea, has been a primary gateway for thousands of refugees and migrants entering the European Union's outermost border this year. Well over half a million refugees, fleeing war, violence and extreme poverty, have arrived in Greece so far this year in what has become the biggest humanitarian crisis on the continent in decades. At a summit last Sunday, EU leaders agreed to co-operate further in handling the crisis and to provide United Nations-aided housing for 100,000 people, half of them in Greece. Aid organisations said that barely addressed the problem of ensuring safe and legal routes for people to seek refuge. ""What we don't need in the wake of this tragedy is another 'extraordinary' meeting that leads to a dead end. What would be truly out of the ordinary - but completely necessary - is real and concerted action,"" said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International's deputy director for Europe.",1

Far from driving a wedge between Russia and Turkey, this assassination will bind them closer together and the embarrassment of such a security lapse in Ankara can only serve Putin's game plan in Syria. ""A crime has been committed and it was without doubt a provocation aimed at spoiling the normalisation of Russo-Turkish relations and spoiling the Syrian peace process which is being actively pushed by Russia, Turkey, Iran and others,"" President Putin said in a televised address. ""There can only be one response - stepping up the fight against terrorism. The bandits will feel this happening,"" he added.

His identity, his motivations and connections,if any,will predictably be the source of countless conspiracy theories. But embarrassing questions as to how either a jihadi or a Gulenist gunman managed to evade intelligence forces and gain such close proximity to the Russian Ambassador will leave Turkey on the backfoot. Since June, President Erdogan has sought to make nice with Putin,finally issuing an apology for the shooting down of Russian aircraft over Syria - blaming it on internal ""Gulenist terrorists"" in an attempt to absolve the Turkish state. The Turkish pro-government press were quick to decry the assassin part of the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation (Feto),the movement led by US-based cleric Fetullah Gulen,who Ankara also blames for the 15Julyattempted coup. ""Great Sabotage"" reads the front page of pro-government newspaper  Yeni Safak , which proclaimed the assassination a CIA and Feto plot aimed at bringing down Russian-Turkish relations - the immediate narrative also pursued by President Putin. Ironically, it could be US relations that suffer as it refuses to deport Gulen from his Pennsylvania home despite repeated requests from Turkey to do so. Turkish politicians took to Twitter to blame the murder on ""dark forces"", also calling it a ""provocation"" meant to destabilise Turkish-Russian relations. It is neither in Russia nor Turkey's interest to elevate this assassination - Russia immediately confirmed that the planned talks on Syria, set for today, will go ahead.

Some ministers admit the migration crisis in Europe could make it harder to convince the public to vote to remain in the 28-nation bloc. They are worried that another wave of refugees arriving in EU countries next summer could dominate the campaign ahead of an in/out referendum held in September -until recently seen as the most likely date.

We would like to get it done as soon as we can, but of course it lies at least partly in the hands of our partners Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary One problem is that other EU leaders have not focused on Britain's negotiation because they have been handling the debt crisis which almost forced Greece out of the Eurozone and then the migration issue. Some other leaders have complained that Mr Cameron has not yet set out his demands. Officially, the Government insists that the migration issue has made other EU member states more open to the reforms being pushed by Mr Cameron. His aides say he will not make a decision on the timing of a referendum until he judges the progress made by December, when EU leaders will discuss ""the British question"" at a summit. Business leaders will urge the Prime Minister not to delay the EU vote. The Institute of Directors (IoD) will warn that putting it back until 2017 would turn it into ""a chance to whack the political elite"" in a mid-term judgement on the Government's spending cuts over the next two years.

He will say: ""I hope this Government will not drag out the referendum process any longer than necessary. While our members believe some uncertainty is a price worth paying to resolve EU membership, delay puts a brake on decision-making, investment and the vigour of their businesses.

Disability organisations from across the country have accused ministersof ignoring questions put to it earlier this year by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, leaving disabled people to face ""serious discrimination"" in educational, employment and social opportunities. The poor supply of accessible housing, the rise in the number of children educated in special schools and cuts to health and social care services, among other issues, place the UK in breach of the Convention on the Rights of Disabled People, according to evidence submitted to the committee.

In a recent report that will be submitted to the committee, UK organisation Disability Rights UK accused the Government of ""dismissing"" the findings and recommendations of the disability committee's report, describing it as a ""dismissal of the lived experiences, views and interests of Disabled people in the UK"". Sue Bott, deputy CEO for Disability Rights UK and co-author of the report, told  The Independent she and other researchers met disabled people across the UK as part of their evidence gathering and found that the UK was ""going backwards"" on disability rights.

Read more Losing EU care staff 'could force disabled people from their homes' In another case, a young woman was unable to meet with researchers from Disability Rights UK because her care package had been cut and she wasn't able to pay a carer to bring her, she said. ""The Government will claim we're world leaders in disability rights, but actually, things have gone rapidly backwards in the last 10 years. We are a developed, rich country and here we are regressing on disability rights,"" said Ms Bott. ""We're hoping that we can engage with Government and get things back on track again, so that we really can be a leader in disability rights. There are things that we feel Government could do which could really improve lives."" The disability organisations will highlight the lack of accessible housing, the decline in disabled children ineducation, cuts tohealth and social services, the rapidly growing use of compulsory detention and forced treatment powers contained in mental health legislation andplans to cap funding for support that allows disabled people to work. It will also raiseconcerns about the level of hate speech and hate crime directed towards thedisabled community. In an initial response to the report, the Government claimed it had a ""long tradition of respecting human rights and continues to promote the social model of disability"". The response continued: ""The UK Government maintains its understanding of emerging ideas about disability through regular engagement with disabled people and their organisations and the sharing of information internationally."" But referring to the Government's submission for the latest investigation, Kamran Mallick, chief executive of Disability Rights UK, said: ""Many of the Government's answers have a tone of complacency at best and high-handed evasion at worst. ""The Government produced no evidence or detail to show how it is supporting people to lead independent lives; something it committed to when it signed the convention in 2009.

""Discussions continue into the early evening, as technical issues are worked out between the two teams."" It was the fourth such meeting between the top Russian and American diplomats in two weeks as the world strains to see whether there might at last be a formula for bringing a halt to five years of fighting that has already claimed 500,000 lives and triggered a refugee crisis. The US official added that the two sides were, ""making progress ... towards advancing proposals that would lead to a nationwide cessation of hostilities in Syria, as well as sustained and unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance for communities most in need"". Not propitious are the circumstances on the ground, however, with fighting reaching new levels of ferociousness in and around the divided city of Aleppo, the most populous in Syria and once a key commercial hub. As part of any deal, the Russians would be expected to persuade the regime of President Bashar al-Assad to end its military actions against rebel forces many of which receive US support. At the same time, however, the Americans would have to demonstrate their ability to detach the rebels groups from extremist terror networks including al-Qaida. Separately, Turkey on Friday renewed its appeals for the creation of a no-fly-zone over northern Syria, a step it says is vital to allow the return of thousands of Syrian refugees to their homeland and for the training of local groups to fight Isis. ""For the people to return home, ensuring ground safety alone would not be sufficient, it would need to be supported by a no-fly zone so that there are no attacks from the air,"" Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters after talks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Istanbul.  Civilian Deaths in Syria Since 2015 | Graphiq  Human rights groups report that the escalating conflict in Aleppo has claimed more than 700 civilian livesin just the last forty days, including 165 children. Aside from the political challenges, the proposed deal would be replete with tangled detail, for instance stating how far troops of all sides would have to fall back from demilitarised zones and the weaponry they would be allowed to keep. Establishing access for humanitarian aid was also a priority. Just on Friday, the UN said that the Syria government had stopped aid convoys to Aleppo earlier this month and the city was on the brink of running out of fuel. And events on the ground in Syria never stop evolving. The Pentagon said on Friday that the US had not been responsible for an air strike that killed Abu Omar Saraqeb, who led the former Nusra Front. ""It was not a U.S. strike,"" Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said.""Whatever happened there, it was not something that the US military did."" Indeed, Pentagon officials say that American forces have stayed away from the fighting in Aleppo itself because it is not an area where Isis has any presence. Not helping are all the simmering tensions between the US and Russia, many stemming from the Syrian crisis itself. Trust between Washington and Moscow remains an elusive commodity.

""On the UNHCR's recommendation, the scheme will not solely target unaccompanied children, but will also extend to vulnerable 'children at risk', such as those threatened with child labour, child marriage and other forms of abuse or exploitation,"" a spokesperson said. Unlike previous British and European initiatives, the scheme is open to refugees of all nationalities, but it excludes those who have already reached Europe. The caveat will come as a disappointmentto charities and MPs who have been campaigning for months for the UK to take in children who have already risked their lives in boat crossings to reach the continent. MPs on the International Development Committee (IDC)approved the move earlier this yearfollowing warnings from humanitarian organisations that thousands of unaccompanied children were left vulnerable to exploitation and violence while living in appalling conditions. An amendment to the Immigration Bill to let 3,000 refugee children already in Europe come to Britain was adopted in the House of Lords last month. The changes are due to be considered by the House of Commons on Monday. Save the Children said 3,000 unaccompanied minors would represent Britain's ""fair share"" of more than 26,000 estimated to have entered Europe. The Refugee Council council said the latest plan was ""not good enough"" when borders remainclosed to refugees and drownings continue in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. Maurice Wren, the charity's chief executive,said: ""This announcement is life-changing, if not life-saving news for the small group of children and their families who will benefit. ""However, it's also grim news for the majority of other refugees who are desperately trying to escape conflict and persecution who the Government is try to contain in Turkey and other, poorer countries.  ""It's not good enough to offer a lifeline to one group of refugees while colluding to close off the escape routes of everyone else -all refugees need to be able to reach a place of safety."" Syrian refugees ask for water in Akcakale at the Turkish border near the Syrian town of Tal Abyad James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, said the Government was committed to helping vulnerable children who had been ""unjustly impacted"" by the humanitarian crisis. ""We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members,"" he added. ""However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK. ""We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made."" The inclusion of refugee camps in North Africa is notable, as the region is the departure point for refugees fleeing war and persecution in Nigeria, Gambia, Senegal, Mali and other African nations who have been excluded by previous schemes.

Humanitarian organisations have already raised concern about the ""huge"" numbers and their implications as border controls continue to tighten on the long route to western Europe and the political will to welcome asylum seekers wanes. Governments and aid agencies hoped that winter weather would slow the tide of flimsy smugglers' boats being sent from Turkey to Greek islands but Greece alone has received more than 97,000 arrivals since the start of 2016, according to International Organisation for Migration (IOM) figures. More than 410 migrants and refugees have died during the same period, mostly in the stretch of the Aegean where Alan Kurdi drowned last year. Syrian refugees make up almost half of those arriving in Greece, while a quarter are from Afghanistan, 17 per cent from Iraq and others from Iran, Pakistan, Morocco, Bangladesh, Somalia and other countries of origin. Meanwhile, smugglers are continuing to abandon large boats off the coast of north Africa, which was the dominant route used in the early part of last year. Following several days with no arrivals mainly due to rough seas, a total of 940 migrants were rescued on Monday off the coast of Sicily, most of whom had fled violence in Sub-Saharan Africa and Libya. Flavio Di Giacomo, the IOM's spokesperson for Italy, said: ""We are still registering the arrival of many vulnerable migrants, who are often in very bad condition, having been subjected to violence by smugglers in Libya. ""We are also still seeing many women victims of trafficking - an alarming trend already registered in 2015."" A spokesperson for the IOM told the  Independent  it was difficult to predict how numbers would develop through the year but said the increase on January and February was ""concerning"". Last year, the number of arrivals grew through the spring and summer to peak in October, before slowly dropping off as winter set in and ending the year at a total of 1.015 million. Save the Children, which is helping the youngest and most vulnerable refugees arriving in Europe, cautioned that the ""unprecedented nature of the crisis"" was making it difficult to plan a response. Refugees use their sleeping blankets to keep warm as they walk along snow covered fields after crossing the Macedonian border into Serbia, near the village of Miratovac Caroline Anning, a spokesperson for the charity, said: ""Based on previous trends, we had thought the numbers of people arriving would drop to a small amount in winter, as cold temperatures and dangerous seas make the journey even more difficult. ""The numbers have gone down, but thousands of people are still arriving every day. ""Their determination in the face of winter storms and increasingly strict European border controls demonstrates how desperate families are to flee the brutal conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, where most refugees are arriving from."" In addition to the freezing winter temperatures on the well-trodden Balkan route, border controls and immigration crackdowns are stranding hundreds of thousands of refugees along the way to destination countries.  New restrictions in Macedonia are preventing Afghans being allowed through, despite the fact they make up around a quarter of arrivals and the fact that around half are women and children. Macedonian policemen stand in front of a gate over rail tracks as migrants wait behind at the Greek-Macedonian border, after additional passage restrictions imposed by Macedonian authorities left hundreds of them stranded near the village of Idomeni, Greece. More than 5,000 people are now trapped at the border, Save the Children estimate, with resources to provide water, food and shelter quickly running out. Meanwhile, French authorities are planning to evict asylum seekers from part of the ""jungle"" camp in Calais, and Austria's decision to cap arrivals was having a knock-on effect along the route. Greece and Italy have long complained at being left to shoulder the bulk of the strain the refugee crisis is putting on Europe and fear restrictions will worsen the situation at arrival points. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said there was also concern about continued deaths at sea, with 340 children having died since the world was shocked by photos of Alan Kurdi's body in August. ""There is still no solution for families like the Kurdis whose lives are in danger ,"" a spokesperson told the  Independent . ""What is needed is safe and legal channels to seek safety in the EU so people aren't forced to take these journeys and put their lives and their children's lives at risk.""",1

Bashar al-Assad's forces and allies from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah are estimated to have seized 60 per cent of territory formerly controlled by the opposition in a bloody campaign marred by allegations of war crimes on both sides. ""We are immediately ready to send out military experts, and diplomats to Geneva in order to agree mutual actions with our American colleagues to ensure the pullout of all the rebels without exclusion from eastern Aleppo,"" said Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister. The United Nations and humanitarian groups have demanded safe passage for civilians to leave opposition areas amid fierce fighting and bombardment, with hundreds reportedly killed since the regime's offensive started last month. At least 45 Syrian refugees killed by regime missile while trying to flee Aleppo Russia has demanded all ""terrorists"" - a term used by Syria to refer to all rebels - withdraw and calls by the UN for jihadi groups to separate themselves from more moderate elements have failed. Read more Children killed while trying to escape eastern Aleppo Clown of Aleppo 'dies in air strike' as Syrian government closes in Aleppo risks becoming 'one giant graveyard' A statement published by an alliance calling itself the Opposition Council for Aleppo on Saturday denied making any agreement with the Syrian government or ""other parties"" and vowed to fight on. Zakaria Malahifji, from the Fastaqim rebel group, told  Reuters : ""I asked the factions, they said 'we will not surrender'. ""The military commanders in Aleppo said 'we will not leave the city. There is no problem with corridors for civilians to leave, but we will not leave the city'."" Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, said some rebel groups had been preventing civilians leaving their territory and told the Security Council he hoped a ""formula for stability"" could be found to end the violence. He has called for the departure of any groups falling until the UN's definition of terrorists but days after a range of moderate, Turkmen, Islamist and jihadi groups pledged to unite against Assad's forces, that prospect looked less likely than ever. Speaking at a conference in Rome, Mr de Mistura predicted eastern Aleppo could fall by the end of the year, saying: ""Aleppo is not going to stay that long."" ""I was feeling it would be a terrible battle ending up by Christmas/New Year. I hope the battle will not take place, that there will be some type of formula,"" he said, alluding to ""informal negotiations"". Almost 30,000 people have been displaced by the fighting, 18,000 of them moving to government-held areas and a further 8,500 going to the Kurdish-controlled neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsoud. Tens of thousands are believed to remain in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, under heavy bombardment and with supplies of food, fuel and healthcare critically low after several hospitals were destroyed. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least three people were killed and 10 injured by air strikes in the al-Shaar neighbourhood on Saturday, leaving several people in a critical condition. A general view taken from the government-held side of Aleppo shows smoke billowing during fighting between Syrian regime forces and rebel fighters in east Aleppo, on December 3, 2016. (AFP/Getty Images) The White Helmets volunteer group said a gathering of displaced people had been struck and put the death toll at more than six, while Syrian state media said four civilians were killed in regime-held areas by rebel rocket attacks and shelling. Around 310 civilians have been killed in the government's assaultsince 15 November, the Observatory said, with at least69 civilians killed in the same period by rebel fire on regime-held west Aleppo. The Tariq al-Bab district was the main focus of fighting overnight, with rebels claiming they had repelled a government assault but photos showing soldiers flashing victory signs in its rubble-strewn streets. Regaining control of Aleppo, formerly Syria's most populous city, would be a symbolic victory for President Assad's government in the fifth year of the civil war. The government has gained ground elsewhere by reaching numerous local agreements with rebels in besieged areas, giving them safe passage to the insurgent-held province of Idlib in exchange for their surrender. Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, warned that Aleppo's fall would not end the war in Syria, where Isis, the former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, Kurdish groups and numerous rebel factions are competing for territory. ""This will only make things worse and, by the way, I am convinced the fall of Aleppo will not end the war,"" she said. ""We will have other military escalations. So if a call to stop has to be made, it has to be made now, not tomorrow or in a week's time.""",0

We don't know, but here are some possibilities",Broadsheet,"The Nobel Prize for Peace will be announced Friday in Oslo. It's awarded by a committee of five appointed by the Norwegian parliament. There's no shoo-in candidate this year, but a think tank in Norway has issued a shortlist of front-runners. Here are the top five candidates, according to Kristian Berg Harpviken, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. The White Helmets In besieged rebel-held areas of Syria, an all-volunteer team known as the Syrian Civil Defense is on the front lines rescuing and treating civilians trapped within the country's many battlefields. By some counts, the group, better known by their nickname ""White Helmets,"" saved up to 60,000 people, often at tremendous risk to themselves. Their heroism has earned plaudits overseas and is even the subject of new documentary available on Netflix. Detractors say that the group is too cozy with foreign powers and some Islamist factions. For many Syrians, though, they are the only difference between life and death. Syrian civil defence volunteers, known as the White Helmets, walk amidst the debris following a reported air strike by Syrian government forces in the rebel-held neighbourhood of Sukkari in the northern city of Aleppo (Getty) Svetlana Gannushkina The Russian mathematician and human rights activist has been a perennial contender for almost a decade - she's a champion of migrant rights, an advocate for a Russian reckoning with the evils of the Soviet past, and a defender of justice and the rule of law. Gannushkina, 74, is Harpviken's top pick this year. Jeanne  Nacatche Banyere , Jeannette Kahindo Bindu and  Dr.  Denis Mukwege The fractious conflicts that have roiled Congo for years have seen the hideous use of rape as a tactic of war. Through their church group, ""Mama"" Jeanne and ""Mama"" Jeannette have sought out the many survivors of rape, built a network of support for victims, and provided medical treatment and other assistance. Mukwege, a leading gynecologist, has aided thousands of victims of rape and played a key role in publicizing the brutality of the violence to the outside world. ""By awarding the trio's local, grass-roots and on-the-ground actions with a Nobel Prize,"" Harpviken notes, ""the Nobel committee has a chance to strengthen the visibility of sexual violence in war as a global problem."" Ernest Moniz and Ali Akbar Salehi Harpviken believes that among all the politicians and diplomats involved in negotiating Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, the U.S. secretary of energy and the head of the Iranian atomic agency perhaps deserve the greatest recognition. They played lead roles as negotiators over the pact that has quieted fears over Iran's nuclear capabilities. Harpviken refers to their collaboration as a ""fine example of science diplomacy - the activation of scholarly competence to build bridges between people and nations."" Edward Snowden The former National Security Agency whistleblower may be a bête noire in Washington, but he commands tremendous respect around the world. His nomination by a pair of Norwegian academics this year triggered fevered speculation over whether Russia, his current host-in-exile, would let him leave to receive the award - and what would happen once he lands in Norway. Pope Francis: The pontiff has made waves on countless fronts since assuming the papal seat, speaking out forcefully on a host of issues from the rights of migrants and refugees to the dangers of economic inequality and climate change. Could he be the first pope to win the prize? The Aegean Islanders: The inhabitants of Greek islands close to Turkey, from whose coast countless migrants and refugees have set sail to Europe, have been caught up in a global maelstrom. No matter the policy paralysis on the international stage, fishermen and locals on islands such as Lesbos have rescued drowning refugees, helped those who reach the shore and welcomed many more into their homes. ""Let's hope they do win,"" Nikos Xydakis, Greece's deputy foreign minister for European affairs, told the Guardian. ""What we saw was ordinary people, with no order from above, respecting tradition and acting out of sheer hospitality and solidarity. What they did shows the best of humanity in the simplest way."" Angela Merkel: The German chancellor was all the rage in 2015, when Time magazine named her Person of the Year, in part for her resolute championing of the plight of Syrian refugees. But the past year has somewhat unraveled her position, with a populist backlash against migrants threatening her political future and prompting her to voice regrets over her policies. Juan Manuel Santos and Timochenko: Sunday's shock referendum results in Colombia, where voters delivered a surprising ""no"" verdict to a proposed peace process between the state and the leftist FARC rebels, was a jarring halt to a historic moment: the end of one the world's longest, most brutal insurgencies and the prospect of political reconciliation. After the referendum, though, there are fears that a cease-fire may collapse. Santos, the Colombian president, and the FARC leader, Rodrigo Londono, known by the nom de guerre Timochenko, had been widely tipped as potential joint Nobel Prize winners. Their chances for the award - not unlike Colombia's hopes for peace - may have just gone up in smoke.",0

We're yet to hear whether he also can't be sexist because his mum is a woman and he loves his mum",Broadsheet,"Jeremy Corbyn has inspired many people across the country, including me, by saying what he means and meaning what he says. Owen Smith sometimes also says what he means and means what he says -and that's when the problems arise. Or perhaps it's all just ""banter"". Read more I'm a reluctant Corbyn voter because Smith will kill Labour off Most people would be entirely willing to forgive a single gaffe or an honest mistake. But Owen Smith's gaffes don't seem like gaffes anymore. There's only so many times that a mistake can be made before it goes from being a mistake to symptomatic of a long-held belief. In the past, Smith has opposed all-women shortlists and has made an inappropriate domestic violence analogy about the coalition government. He's told one party leader that she's only offered time onTV because she's a woman. He's threatened to ""smash Theresa May back on her heels""and implied that misogyny has only been a problem since Jeremy Corbyn became leader -as if Labour women hadn't experienced structural barriers or abuse prior to September 2015. He also told Leanne Wood that she probably only got invited on TV because of her ""gender"". Kay Burley says Owen Smith 'is toast'in live TV interview And this week, Smith shared a photo of a gobstopper saying he'd found the ""perfect present""for Nicola Sturgeon. When people criticised him for his ""Calm down, dear""stance on women being vocal in politics, he then retorted that it was ""just banter"", because apparently he's applying for a job at the Lad Bible rather than attempting to leader a political party into a general election. He added that he couldn't possibly be accused of sexism given that there were women working on his campaign -we're yet to hear whether he also can't be sexist because his mum is a woman and he loves his mum. Smith seems to be acting more like the candidate for leadership of a university rugby club, rather than the leadership of our party and our country. And he's as ignorant on issues of race as he is on gender. He has said that there are too many immigrants in parts of Britain, and that Syrian refugees were putting pressure on local schools in Wales. But in Smith's area, just 2.1 per cent of locals were born outside of the UK and only 16 refugees - yes, 16 -have settled there in the last few months. The numbers don't exactly back him up. Smith promises investment and support for the controversial Prevent strategy, while utterly ignoring the concerns of minorities, senior police officers and academics about its fitness for purpose. The policy has seen a Muslim student arrested for reading a book about terrorism for his studies, an eight-year-old referred over a T-shirt wrongly assumed to be ""extremist"", and countless other examples of racial profiling which have alienated minority communities. We know all too well what happens when Labour takes its eye off the ball on these issues: in 2011 the former Labour immigration minister was rightly barred from office over a campaign apparently aimed at ""getting the white vote angry"" at the ""mad Muslims"", while in the early days of New Labour leaflets read: ""Labour are on your side, the Lib Dems are on the side of failed asylum seekers.""We can't afford to slip backwards under Owen Smith; we have to move on from this painful past. Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn clash at latest leadership debate The sponsored silence undertaken by Labour MPs about Smith's sexist and racist words has spoken volumes. Those supporting Smith's campaign have had very little to say. It is a shame to see that MPs previously committed to standing up for equality have now become far more committed to breaking Jeremy Corbyn and the movement around him. Meanwhile, in Corbyn we have a candidate who has built his political life around fighting for justice and equality, whether as a trade union officer fighting for equal pay for women or an MP arrested for protesting against apartheid. This election campaign has seen him transform his passion for equality into a bold and credible set of policies. This election has become a choice between the negative, damaging campaign being offered by Owen Smith that seeks to drag Labour back to the past and a positive project that looks to transform and rebuild Labour's future being offered by Jeremy Corbyn. Smith's rhetoric on women and minorities has no place in that future.",0

Here, she talks to Jamie Milton aboutreflecting our lives back at us and forging magic out of madness",Broadsheet," Kate Tempest takes a particular interest in other people's lives. The former Mercury Prize nomineeand judgeconcerns herself with characters: their nine-to-fivejobs; their idiosyncrasies and worst habits; the ways they punch the clock. Several of these strangers make up her new album  Let Them Eat Chaos , a collection of songs centred around an apocalyptic storm that, while wreaking havoc, manages to bring seven lost souls together. ""There's a real problem if you're not thinking about where other people have been or where they're going,"" she says, sitting on a bench outside Deptford market in south-east London in the blazing, late September sun. This happens to be the perfect place to people-watch, and many passers-by -unaware of Tempest's celebrated status -make quick conversation with the musician, poet, screenplay writer and author. It's moments like these where London shows itself to be brilliantly alive, a source of endless fascination. ""If you live in a big city, the impact that will have on you is pretty relentless,"" Tempest says, to the soundtrack of blaring traffic and buzzing market stalls. ""I understand the kind of toll it takes on people to be so surrounded by life. And obviously the coping mechanism is to exclude as much as you can from your field of vision, so you can focus on the things that you've got todo. But I think it's making people pretty unwell.Just look again. Remember that all of these people are human beings, they've been through a hell of a lot that day, that week, that month, that year. Reinvest yourself with a sense of empathy that extends beyond your exhaustion, your particular panic."" Read more Kate Tempest announces new album Let Them Eat Chaos Let Them Eat Chaos centres around one specific time and place -a near-silent London street at 4.18am, with all but seven strangers fast asleep. The restless ones are caught up in their own personal turmoil. Pete is chasing a paycheque, spending it on booze, ending up more broke than the previous month. Pious can't discover love and finds himself hooked on one night stands. Zoe is packing her life into cardboard boxes, wondering where she goes next. All of these characters are in a lonely rut. With their stories unfolding, the album then finds Tempest painting a picture of the world today. She captures the confusion of a modern world, stampeding over harsh realities using dagger-sharp lyricism and equally tight, abrupt production from Dan Carey. One lyric, on the sprawling ""Europe Is Lost"", is especially eye-opening. ""Massacres, massacres, massacres/New shoes,"" she chants, instantly distracted from tragedies thousands of miles from home. ""That is the reality,"" she says, when asked to unravel that line. ""It's a fleeting concern for the loss of life, if it's on a grand enough scale that pricks your attention. And then there's a much more pressing concern. 'I saw these shoes. They're so nice.' It's just reality for people."" There area dozen harsh lessons in each of these songs, but Tempest doesn't want to come across as judgemental. ""I hope it doesn't feel like there's any blame in it. It's just a description of what's happening,"" she claims. ""It's just f**king hysteria. We are living in this absolute madness. Absolute f**king madness. No wonder everyone's feeling so mental. The conversations that I've had with people, they're saying this is always the way it's been. People have always felt terrified about where the world is heading. In the Cold War, people were living with the very real threat of the end of the world. And I do understand that. But in terms of where we're heading, with the daily advancements and the impossibility of seeing anything as a whole -I'm talking about economics, technological advancements, humans fusing with cyborgs, nano-robots that cure and detect diseases, international relations -nobody can see where we're heading."" Tempest makes writing music sound like a primal process: something that just happens (Neil Gavin) Beyond an end-times sense of impending doom, her new album has one silver lining. When a storm breaks, Let Them Eat Chaos 'sseven strangers are forced to flee their homes. ""They all realise they're part of something much bigger than themselves,"" she sums up. ""In that moment, there's something beautiful. That's the redemption."" There's similar optimism to be sourced from the real world's state of disarray, she says. ""It's really helpfuland amazingto have music, literature, poetry at these times."" And it's true that Tempest isn't the only musician to be casting an eye on what's going on today. A wave of young musicians are expressing concern, anguish and protest without being strictly classed as ""political"" songwriters. They wrestle with gender, identity and race in ways that help make more sense of the world. Tempest is right up there with the best of them in forging magic out of madness, which is why  Let Them Eat Chaos  is her first release to be met with anticipation on such a big scale. Writing music with a sharp moral compass isn't something she strives for, however. ""When the idea comes, it doesn't come from you,"" she says. ""So all you can do is equip yourself to express these things adequately, and then realise that you'll never get it right and you'll always have to keep trying."" Fans stop Tempest in the street to thank her for being a 'big inspiration' (Neil Gavin) For Tempest, the downside to capturing so much anger and frustration in this kind of vivid detail is having to explain it further in interviews. The way she describes making music, it sounds like a primal process,something that just happens. Looking back on these songs, tracing steps and delving deeper is far from her idea of fun, to say the least. A couple of times, when pressed to explain the meaning behind one thought or the other, she seizes up. ""It's so useless me even talking about this,"" she quips, midway through describing people's reaction to the Syrian refugee crisis. It's not that she's being hostile, more that she's pointedly aware of how broad statements could be taken out of context. ""People - especially journalists -seem to be hankeringafter a political statement or stance. But if you've just made a whole album that expresses some quite nuanced views on a given situation, the last thing you want todo is sum that up in a couple of sentences that will come nowhere near to expressing the scope and the complexities of how things feel at the minute."" She ends on a cutting, bleak note. ""To be even more frank, it's too late. It's too late now. It's gone beyond somebody being right and somebody being wrong. It's far too late. We're in the middle of a massive humanitarian crisis. The planet's on its way out. Well, we are. It's too late to be tip-toeing around."" At this moment, a fan recognises her in the street and thanks her for being such a ""big inspiration"". Whether she chose to become one or not, Kate Tempest is one of the country's most vital songwriters. We've experienced a year where very little makes sense and tomorrow's problems are even more frightening, but this only goes to further establish the importance of musicians who can at least attempt to make sense of what's happening.

Ticketmaster should be fitted with a breathalyser; Grace Dent realises there's nothing rock'n'roll about watching a toddler bounce up and down at the O2,Broadsheet,"We were waiting for Bono to appear - with his bouffant and his Cuban heels - at The O2 Greenwich. Ticket prices for me and some friends, I'll admit, had been idiotically expensive. They would not merely have fed a boat of Syrian refugees, they would have paid for a small seaworthy ferry and an engineful of diesel too. Nevertheless, I bought U2 tickets seven months ago. Three Old Fashioned cocktails and an earnest revisit of The Unforgettable Fire album had led me to believe this wouldn't just be a great night out, but more akin to a noble, life-enhancing quest. Plus, I've always had a soft spot for them. It was immensely funny watching wazzocks trying to remove the free U2 download from their Apple devices last year in order to virtue-signal displeasure at Bono's tax affairs. But how many tours do U2 still have in them? I plod ever closer to death and so do they. Imagine if I don't buy U2 tickets and then The Edge hangs up that mottled woollen beanie hat for good? But that's how stadium ticket-buying gets you, each and every time. Madonna - God love her - has flogged tickets for her previous three globe-trekking enormodome tours via the sheer power of sentimentality and fan FOMO alone. (That's Fear of Missing Out for my readers who missed out on FOMO.) Not from anyone's desire to see ""True Blue"" noodled through on an acoustic guitar. Nevertheless, I've shunned Madonna's new Rebel Heart tour. I can't say this has been easy. Like all the behemoths of rock and pop, she seems oddly important to my existential inner workings. Madge and her conical tits made me who I am, therefore, part of me feels duty-bound to give her £165 three times a decade to endure an a capella ""Papa Don't Preach"" and ""Dress You Up"" performed solely on cowbells. The Ticketmaster website, I now realise, should probably be fitted with a breathalyser. Or at least a benevolent, motherly sounding lady who will telephone me at 2am from a Sunderland call centre to say, ""Oh hello Miss Dent! Now can I call you Gracie? Ah, Gracie, we see you've just spent £388 on two tickets to see Tom Petty. Now, have you been drinking gin and tonics and watching his 1981 duet with Stevie Nicks on YouTube? Oh we thought so."" ""Yes,"" I'd mumble sheepishly. ""Now,"" she'd say, ""We'd like you to name six tracks off Tom's 13th studio album Hypnotic Eye before we can process this transaction."" But this hasn't happened yet. So there I was at U2 waiting for Bono, whom I still quite fancy - as I did in 1982 when he looked smoking in a black singlet and black denims, with a sexy home-streaked mullet. This was before 1988 and the Rattle and Hum period when they all began dressing like actors in a Disney theme park Spaghetti Western experience.

I can't see very much of 2015 Bono because a very tall man in the row in front of me, dressed in a shiny suit like a regional bank manager, is filming the stage on an iPhone 6. His wife and seven-year-old child are standing beside him thrusting identical iphone 6s in the air, documenting similar fuzzy, unwatchable bragging-rights dirge to delight no one. Little Jonty - they're always called Jonty - is standing on his £183 seat. I'm guessing the man's family are there via blackmail. Something like, ""Of course you can go to your noisy rock concert! As long as you take us! We can make an evening of it! We can go to Chiquitos for a nacho platter beforehand. And we can leave before the end if Jonty gets sleepy!"" There is nothing rock'n'roll about stadium rock: the pre-show Wagamama Yaki Udon and the All Bar One Pino Grigio stampede; the U2 merchandise coffee mug stall; the public transport back-log and the official council authorised busker; the rush before the final encore to avoid the snarl up on the M25 and bored children who should have been left with baby-sitters. Predictably, after four songs, Jonty made a nest of coats, snuggled down and attempted to insulate himself against Bono's monologue about his mother Iris's fatal aneurysm in 1974. This was followed by a20-minute-long, multi-media bombardment of Bono's feelings on the refugee crisis. This was - I para-phrase - ""Let's get rid of borders, man, and love each other!"" I could have done with ""Bad"" or ""New Year's Day"" or ""Lemon"" during this bit. Finally, Noel Gallagher appeared to jam through ""All You Need Is Love"". I'm not entirely sure this is true. I have tried living on love and it gets old very quickly. Living on money is lovelier. Clearly Bono agrees with me at some level. That's why it was £183 a ticket.  @gracedent ",0

Outbreaks of the disease, known as leishmaniasis, have been reported repeatedly over the past year. More recently, the head of the Kurdish Red Crescent was reported to have said the problem was made worse by the actions of Islamic State leaving bodies to rot in the streets. But while leishmaniasis is a serious problem in Syria, this picture of a flesh-eating disease spread by terrorists isn't entirely accurate. What is leishmaniasis? Leishmaniasis has actually been endemic to Syria for centuries and was once commonly known as ""Aleppo evil"". This cutaneous (skin-affecting) form of the disease isn't strictly ""flesh eating"", although another form found in Brazil and some other parts of South America can be. It is caused by the  Leishmania  parasite, which is carried by sandflies. If you're bitten by a fly, the parasites can enter your blood and invade the macrophage immune cells that normally kill bugs, causing causing horrible open sores close to the bite. Read more  Europe's leaders urged to open their hearts to Syrian refugees   Photos 'confirm deaths of 7,000 in Syrian prisons during civil war'   Conditions in Syria are getting worse, warns UN humanitarian chief   Syrian refugee couple thrown surprise wedding reception in Canada  In other places, in particular India, a different form of the parasite spreads to the liver and spleen and causes death as those vital visceral organs break down. In the Brazilian form, the parasites cause macrophages to migrate to the mucosal surfaces around the mouth and nose. Here the immune system attacks the parasites but ends up causing substantial damage to surrounding tissue, eating away the flesh in these areas, leading to gross disfigurements. Sandflies actually don't eat rotting bodies on the street, they suck blood from living people, so the reports about Islamic State spreading the disease aren't strictly true. However, the political events in Syria - including the rise of Islamic State - have caused the collapse of the country's health systems, along with every other part of the social structure there. So inevitably, the disease has been spreading more widely. The Leishmania parasite Shutterstock Can it be treated? Today, around 1.3m people are infected with leishmaniasis every year across the tropics and sub-tropics. Most sufferers have the cutaneous form, as found in Syria, while the visceral form can be fatal. But because it is typically found among the world's poorest people, it receives little attention in terms of developing new drugs or vaccines and is considered a neglected tropical disease. However, treatments do exist and in a functioning health system drugs can be used to cure the disease. Scientists are still debating the best treatment for the cutaneous disease but at present we have four different drugs that can be used. The best medicine for visceral leishmaniasis is called amphotericin B and when injected it is very efficient at curing the disease. Just a few injections of the drug can be enough to cure the disease, but it does carry the risk of side effects such as fever, headaches and vomiting. Older drugs have to be given for several weeks to show an effect. For example, when TV adventurer Ben Fogle caught the cutaneous disease in Peru a few years ago he was treated with a rather toxic antimony-based drug, which made him feel very ill and lose large amounts of weight but eventually cured him. Could it spread more widely? In addition to the increasing incidence of the disease in Syria itself, some refugees fleeing the country will carry parasites with them. This could be used by those who oppose taking in refugees by suggesting they will spread disease. But countries receiving refugees need not worry about its introduction. It is sandflies, not people, that transmit the disease and though they are found throughout the tropics and subtropics, they can't survive in colder climates. The visceral form of leishmaniasis is already endemic in parts of southern Europe including Spain, Italy and the south of France, but the disease tends to only manifest itself in people with weak immune systems such as those infected with HIV. This highlights the fact that people in prosperous regions where nutrition and general health are good are at limited risk. It is also important to understand that different species of sandfly are responsible for transmission of different  Leishmania  parasites. Those that transmit the cutaneous disease found in Syria are less common in southern Europe so the chances of increasing transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis are small. Although Turkey might be at risk of increased incidence of the cutaneous disease due to the flow of refugees from Syria, again it is worth highlighting that people with access to good nutrition and in generally good health are less vulnerable. Concerns about imported germs, of course, are nothing new. Just last year, European airports were decorated with posters warning of Ebola, and those coming from West Africa were subjected to mandatory tests for signs of fever. But we should be careful of warnings of diseases spreading to developed countries, where healthcare systems and levels of public health are much more capable of preventing and treating infectious condition, even in instances where those diseases could spread. Plus the wider availability of treatments in Europe creates an opportunity to provide healthcare to incoming sick refugees. Given that leishmaniasis cannot be spread to colder countries and is limited by good healthcare, the particular suggestion that it could be carried by refugees holds no force.

Four decades on, the diplomats' bravery has finally been recognised",Broadsheet,"There was little room for doubt as the corpse of a murdered dissident was thrown into the walled garden of the embassy. Italian diplomats knew then, if they had not before, that they had gained the attention - and opprobrium - of Augusto Pinochet, the supposed friend of the British government whose regime terrorised Chile for 17 years. The naked body was that of left-wing activist Lumi Videla, one of thousands tortured to death as the US-backed dictator squeezed the life out of any political resistance after seizing power in 1973. The bodies began to mount up. The dead included students, the homeless and trade union members. But hundreds more fortunate Chileans were able to seek refuge in foreign embassies, and now, the government of Chile has recognised the outstanding role played by Italy in providing a diplomatic lifeline for those under threat. Read more Chilean ex-soldier charged with murder after confessing on live radio Chile's current ambassador to Rome, Fernando Ayala, presented Diplomas of Honour to Rome's diplomats in Santiago in the early 1970s, who saved the lives of up to 750 Chileans with their own ""Schindler's List"", hiding them in the Embassy grounds and escorting many out of the country with specially prepared diplomatic passes. Mr Ayala said that the awards, given to five senior Italian officials, were ""a symbolic act, an acknowledgement to the great generosity of all Italians to the Chileans persecuted by the dictatorship in the Seventies"". He added: ""I want to thank again in the name of the government of Chile all the Italian governments... that never once failed to condemn the military dictatorship of Pinochet, and allowed hundreds of Chilean families into Italy to start new lives."" ""We didn't plan to do anything at the beginning,"" said Roberto Toscano, second secretary to Rome's Ambassador in Santiago during the first two blood-soaked years after General Pinochet came to power. ""It just happened. The first to arrive after the coup were Chilean-Italians, who we had to protect. Then many others who jumped over the wall and took refuge in the residence."" (In red, then left to right) Anna Sofia de Vergottini, the widow of the former ambassador, diplomats Elena Piaciotti, Roberto Toscano, Emilio Barbarani and other officials are honoured by Chile in Rome Mr Toscano, then an inexperienced second secretary and his superior Piero de Masi, the chargé d'affaires, were in charge in the absence of Italy's ambassador, Tomaso de Vergottini, who had not been allowed back into Chile after Italy refused to recognise the legitimacy of the Pinochet regime. ""In some periods there were up to 250 refugees in the Embassy at the same time. There were only five or six bathrooms available and it formed a long line just to wash and shave,"" Mr Toscano told  La Repubblica . Then came the incident of Ms Videla's body being thrown into the Embassy grounds in November 1974. The Pinochet-controlled press declared she had been tortured and killed during an orgy in the embassy involving left-wing dissidents. The regime sought to use this as an excuse to force its way into the embassy and clear out the political refugees. Read more Chilean exile wins landmark compensation for torture under Pinochet With the Pinochet regime's patience finally wearing thin, Mr Toscano was declared ""persona-non grata"" and forced to leave Chile by the end of 1974. He went on to become Italy's ambassador in India and Iran. Other opponents of the dictatorship to hide out in the Italian embassy included Silvano Girotto, also known as ""Brother Mitra"", a former Franciscan monk and leftist militant, who later became familiar in Italy after collaborating with Italian authorities in the capture of the Red Brigades' terrorist leader Renato Curcio. Mr Girotto had come from Bolivia to Chile to aid the fight against the Pinochet dictatorship. ""He had a shoulder injury,"" said Mr Toscano, ""We treated him and then he left for Italy."" The Italian diplomat recalled how the Franciscan resistance fighter left a large gun in the embassy, hidden in a sack of powdered milk. Mr Ayala said other countries, some in Latin American, helped dissidents during ""the darkest period in Chilean history""; among the European embassies most active in saving Chileans were the Swedish and Italian embassies. The embassy of the US, which engineered Pinochet's brutal coup against the far-left, democratically elected government of Salvador Allende was not much help. But neither was the British Embassy, said Mr Toscano. Britain's indifference to the crimes of Pinochet appeared to have passed when it agreed to a request by Spanish magistrates to arrest the dictator in October 1998, while he was visiting the UK for medical treatment. But the first seizure of a former head of state travelling on a diplomatic passport on British soil, also provoked the wrath of senior Conservative politicians, including Margaret Thatcher and Norman Lamont. They were dubbed ""Tories for Torture"" by the leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Nonetheless, a campaign to free the dictator saw him return to Chile 18 months later. Pinochet finally made way for a return to democratic government in 1988. La Repubblica  called the actions of Italian diplomats in Santiago in the early 1970s, ""one of the most beautiful and moving pages in the history of our international solidarity"". ""When I accompanied the persecuted Chileans to the airport safe and sound,"" Mr Toscano said, ""I thought being a diplomat was the best job in the world."" He also compared, unfavourably, his country's generosity then with Europe's current attitude to Syrian refugees. ""Our indifference is shocking,"" he said. ""I think it's because politics is dead and we live in the time of fear. The story of the solidaritywe saw in the years of the Pinochet coup gives us some idea of how much we've changed today.""",0

The incoming president,  in an interview with Michael Gove published in The  Times , also discussed the future of the EU, his stance on Russia and a new trade deal with the UK. Here are the 10most important things he said: 1.Brexit 'a great thing' ""I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing,"" Mr Trump told the newspaper. He added: ""The fact that your pound sterling has gone down? Great. Because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the UK."" 2. The EU will break up US President-elect Donald Trump on recent allegations The President-elect predicted the EU would continue to break apart as European countries react to an influx of refugees threatening each nations identity. ""People, countries, want their own identity and the UK wanted its own identity,"" he told the newspaper. He said if EU countries hadn't been ""forced to take in all of the refugees"" that ""you wouldn't have a Brexit."" He added: ""I do think keeping it together is not gonna be as easy as a lot of people think. ""And I think this, if refugees keep pouring into different parts of Europe... I think it's gonna be very hard to keep it together because people are angry about it."" 3.Nato is 'obsolete' US soldiers arrive to  Zagan , Poland as part of  Nato  deployment ( Zbigniew Janicki / Agencja Gazeta /Reuters) While saying he is committed to the defence of Europe and the West, Mr Trump told The Times he is concerned Nato has not reformed to meet the main threat of Islamist terrorism. He called the North American Treaty Organisation ""obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror"" and said member organisations are not paying their ""fair share"". ""I said a long time ago that Nato had problems. Number one it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago. Number two the countries aren't paying what they're supposed to pay."" He added: ""A lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States. With that being said, Nato is very important to me."" 4. Trade deal with the UK Mr Trump said he would move ""very quickly"" to make a new trade deal with the UK. ""I'm a big fan of the UK, we're gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly,"" he said. ""Good for both sides."" 5. Angela Merkel German Chancellor Angela  Merkel  came under political pressure following the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin (Reuters) Criticising German chancellor Angela Merkel's immigration policies, he said she made ""one catastrophic mistake"" by welcoming an unlimited number of Syrian refugees, which he referred to as ""all these illegals"". He also suggested the December Christmas market attack by a Tunisian man was one effect of Ms Merkel's policies. 6. Russia Mr Trump wants a new arms control agreement with Russian President Vladimir  Putin (MIKHAIL  KLIMENTIEV /AFP/ Getty  Images) The President-elect said he will consider reviewing US sanctions on Russia if President Vladimir Putin is prepared to move away from confrontation. ""For one thing, I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, that's part of it,"" he said. ""But Russia's hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit."" 7. Syria Russian President Vladimir  Putin  greets his Syrian counterpart  Bashar al-Assad  upon his arrival for a meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow ( Getty ) Mr Trump criticised President Barack Obama for failing to take action on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and for allowing Russia to take control of the course of the civil war. He said ""nothing happened"" when the US ""had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand."" ""​Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town - they can't even walk and they're shooting 'em - it almost looks like they're shooting 'em for sport - ah no, that's...a terrible situation."" 8.

4157,src_theindependent_raw5.docx,The Independent,30/7/2016,1052 words,DAVID USBORNE IN PHILADELPHIA,A tale of two conventions: Trump and Clinton offered utterly opposing visions,Broadsheet,"They both made history. They both struggled to project visions of perfect unity. They both used fear and grief to motivate their troops as they prepare to square off in the general election. The back-to-back Republican and Democratic hullabaloos in Cleveland and Philadelphia echoed each other in other ways too. The kids of the candidates got starring roles to soften the edges of their images. Retired military brass were deployed, rather, to apply a layer of tungsten. Neither were in the least bit dull, which can often be the case with these stage-managed affairs. As America sighs in relief and returns to normal programming, how does one tell them apart, even for those of us who were at both? Where was it that, unprompted, a delegate turned to this reporter and let loose a blaze of vitriol about the dishonest, biased liberal media? It was in Philadelphia. Which party threw a convention 75 per cent of Americans saw as ""positive""? The Republicans. Suddenly, it all seems a blur. Exposing the brain to protracted blasts of very hot air can do that to a person. I know Hillary Clinton was in dazzling white. And I am thinking Ivanka Trump was also. Correct me if I'm wrong. I am no longer sure. Although, you know what, who cares? Except, of course, we do. Step back and recover your faculties and you are reminded that while they deployed a few of the same tricks, from the balloon drops to the casting of minor and major celebrities - the Republicans had to settle for minor ones, whose names also escape me for now - in all ways that matter these conventions were negative images of one another. And so it should be, perhaps. What would be the point of an election if there was no telling the candidates and their parties apart? The Venn diagram of partisan America is different now. There is scant overlap between the two camps anymore and it showed at the conventions. It's why when Ms Clinton declared the country was approaching a ""day of reckoning"" she had it exactly right. Does America want a Cleveland future or a Philadelphia future? One option looks a whole lot darker than the other. There were moments in Cleveland when this reporter's jaw hit the floor. Rudy Giuliani ranting about extremist Islamic terror made me wonder if he'd jumped the rails. Governor Chris Christie playing a sort of charades pretending to be a Nuremberg prosecutor listing the reasons Ms Clinton must be punished. ""Guilty or not guilty?"" he asked of each charge. ""Guilty!"" the delegates roared. When retired Army general Michael Flynn prompted one of numerous rounds of chants of ""lock her up"", he scanned the faces of his own party and replied, ""There's nothing wrong with that."" The Republican convention made history because of the depth of its fury and the odious spread of its vitriol. That 'positive' GOP convention poll is hard to fathom, isn't it? It was done for CNN. Those people must have been watching the Cleveland convention with blindfolds on. And earplugs in. The utterly opposing tones - ethical codes even - of the two campaigns was perhaps best displayed on Thursday night. In Philadelphia the Muslim father of a Muslim son, Army Capt. Human S.M. Khan, who was killed while fighting for America in Iraq in 2004, took to the stage and brandished the US constitution to chide Mr Trump. ""Look for the words liberty and equal protection under the law"", he told the Republican nominee wondering if he had ever actually read it. The delegates in the room erupted into chants of, ""USA, USA, USA!"" Several hundred miles west in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Mr Trump was in the midst of a rally perfectly encapsulating what the father of that soldier was talking about. He essentially equated all Syrian refugees with terrorists and rehearsed his pledge to bring back waterboarding. Ms Clinton wants to open the refugee floodgates, he opined, he would sent them back. ""You know what they do? They put them all over the country. Nobody even knows where they're being put, so we don't even know what's going to happen - but all we know is we watch these people with the slashings and the throat cuttings and the cutting off of the heads and the drowning in steel cages,"" Mr Trump declared. ""These are people, they have to be stopped,"" the man who may be president went on. ""They have to be stopped. And they have to be stopped very, very strongly and very viciously, if we have to."" And his supporters in the room roared back, ""USA, USA, USA!"" Like the campaigns themselves, the two conventions were addressing two entirely different audiences in a land cleaved down the middle over where they want it to go next. Ms Clinton summed up that division the best. Her campaign is about bringing Americans together to chart the best course forward, she said, while her opponent is asking permission to rule all on his own. ""Don't believe anyone who says: 'I alone can fix it'"", she said. ""Those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. Really? 'I alone can fix it?'"" When she was done and just before her balloon drop, delegates in the hall held coloured cards before their faces that spelled what has become the slogan of her campaign: 'Stronger Together'. Mr Trump had used Cleveland to instill fear about a country that he claimed has already spun out of control, and is threatened by violence and mayhem from all quarters. Ms Clinton's vision of America is that it is actually great - already. The fear she was talking about was the fear of how things would be if Mr Trump is allowed to take the wheel, have his finger on the nuclear codes and his hands on the drawings for a wall along America's southern border. More people tuned into her convention than his by a few million each night. While seats were empty most nights in Cleveland, in Philadelphia it was standing room only four nights in a row. While Cleveland often felt flat even as it felt angry, in Philadelphia the electricity in the hall was palpable, even if at times some of it was generated by supporters of Bernie Sanders still smarting that she was the one accepting the nomination and not him. If those are the measures by which we judge the success or failure of a party convention, the Democrats can feel more confident than the Republicans. But the fun, music, treacly video biographies and comic turns are all over now. Let hand-to-hand combat begin.",0

He executed something of a retreat by not proposing an immediate, single round up of all 11 million people living illegally, and ejecting them en masse, as he has in the past. But in all other respects it was the tough, fear-mongering Trump of old who showed up in Phoenix.

But if it made an impact it was also because of its tone. Once more, Mr Trump drew a dystopian, nightmarish picture of a country that would dissolve into chaos and violence if his plans for border control are not enforced. It was also an aggressive, sometimes fiery speech that repeatedly sought to demonise the entire community of undocumented residents in America by zeroing in on the few criminals among them. That included bringing to the stage a contingent of grieving parents whose children had perished at the hands of people who should not have been in the country. His panoply of notions for a safer nation behind tighter borders may have thrilled his base - mostly white, non-college educated men - but surely did little to help the candidate broaden his base of support to include moderate Republicans and independents or Hispanics generally. -That wall: He vowed to build it and he said again that Mexico would pay for it.

They, he vowed, would be subject to deportation the first day that he is in office. ""Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone,"" he said. He would create a ""deportation task force"" to make it happen. -Amnesty: He said there would be none of it for even those who have lived productively in the US and committed no crimes. The only path to becoming legalised, Mr Trump said, would be for every one of these people to return to their home countries and then apply under his new, strengthened system to come back in. ""Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation,"" he said. ""There will be no amnesty."" ""Our message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. People will know you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalised,"" -If they simply stay? That is the nub of the problem that has vexed politicians of both parties for years. He would not grant amnesty or a path to legal citizenship for those undocumented residents who are law abiding, but what would Trump then do about them? He confessed he didn't know, saying he would address it once his broader border protection plan is in place.

By executive order, Mr Obama temporarily sheltered them from the threat of deportation. Mr Trump said he would reverse the order. -Sanctuary cities: Mr Trump said he would withhold federal funds from those American cities that do not permit the authorities to try to identify and arrest people simply for being undocumented. But there is barely a large metropolis in America that would not fit into this category. -Stop 'catch and release' : This is not fishing.

Among them, that they would have to earn ""ideological certification"" before being given a visa to make sure ""that those we are are admitting our country share our values an love our people"". He added that this vetting would include getting questions right about honour killings, women, gay people and radical Islam. -Country blacklist: Once inaugurated, Trump would form a panel of experts to study which regions or countries in the world he would suspend immigration from, saying Syria and Libya would be high on his list. This is his variation on the original plan articulated last year to impose a ban on Muslims entering the country. -Refugee 'safe zones': Trump once more slammed Obama and Hillary Clinton for allowing Syrian refugees to settle in the US and proposed the building of 'safe zones' in the Middle East where, he claimed, there would be no assimilation problems for them, and would cost the US less. -Welfare abuse: While he did explain how strictly this would be applied, Mr Trump said anyone in the US illegally who was benefiting from welfare payments, including food stamps, would be ""prioritised for immediate removal"" from the country.",0

In the second of our three-part series on the geopolitically crucial nation, LAURA PITEL in Diyarbakir finds anger on the streets Crisis in Turkey",Broadsheet,"Mehmet Mutlu was not the brightest of boys - likeable enough, but with little interest in learning. There was a sense of inevitability for his teacher when he learnt, last month, that his 16-year-old pupil had been killed in clashes between Kurdish youths and Turkish security forces. But it was still a shock. ""He was lying on the ground, his face in a pool of blood,"" he recalled with sadness. ""He was my student."" For 30 years the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has engaged in armed struggle against the Turkish state. Now the collapse of a ceasefire last summer has plunged the mainly Kurdish south-east of the country into the bloodiest bout of violence since the 1990s. With a struggling economy, a population of more than two million Syrian refugees and a volatile border with Syria and Iraq, Turkey can ill afford a long-running internal conflict. Yet its litany of death shows no sign of ending; yesterday, three policemen were killed and four more were wounded in a suspected PKK attack in the province of Sirnak. While previous flare-ups were characterised by tit-for-tat strikes on Turkish army posts and PKK training camps, much of the fighting is now taking place in cities. These urban clashes are being fought by teenagers and 20-somethings under the banner of the recently formed Patriotic Revolutionary Youth Movement. Announced in February 2013, shortly before the PKK declared a ceasefire, its stated aims included tackling drugs and prostitution as well as protecting communities from what it termed ""the tyranny and persecution"" of the police. Known by the initials YDG-H, the youth movement has formed armed branches across the south-east. When the conflict reignited last July, its members dug trenches among homes and shops and threw up barricades. It declared ""autonomous zones"", daring the state to force it out. Mehmet Mutlu's story is typical of the tales told by friends, relatives and neighbours of the children of the 1990s who are fighting street to street in the Sur district of Diyarbakir. Mehmet's teacher, who asked for his name and subject to be withheld for fear of losing his job, said that his pupil's father was imprisoned for about 14 years ""for political reasons"". His older brother, he said, had gone to fight in Rojava, the Kurds' name for the territory they hold in northern Syria. ""This kind of child, whose dad was in prison for 13, 14 years, they have a feeling of hate towards those who did this,"" he said. Chain smoking as he spoke, the teacher, whose school is in the middle of the embattled Sur area, painted a picture of classrooms filled with poor but politicised students. The south-east has unemployment rates of up to 24 per cent and after-school jobs left little time to study, he said. Having grown up using Kurdish at home, many spoke poor, accented Turkish. Despite some reforms by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), many students felt alienated, the teacher claimed, by an educational system that denied them their distinct ethnic and cultural identity. ""On Monday and Friday we have to sing the national anthem and... most of them don't sing it,"" he said. ""We play it, but they don't sing. When it's not loud enough, they have to do it again."" Many young people have spent spells in prison for hurling stones or Molotov cocktails. Mesut Simeksek, 25, who was killed in December, served three years in jail before joining the fighting in Diyarbakir, according to his older sister, Guler Sevikek. Their family took refuge in Sur after fleeing the small town of Lice in the 1990s. Like Mehmet, Mesut had a brother fighting in Syria and was traumatised by the state's treatment of his father and brother. His sister recalled: ""They were forced to lie on the street and were surrounded by dogs. Mesut used to say: 'How can I ever forget that image?'"" Those fighting in Diyarbakir are no angels. Mesut's sister admits that he was armed, though she disputes claims by pro-government media that he was among the most dangerous terrorists in Diyarbakir. Mehmet's teacher, too, believes he carried a weapon, though he is alarmed by claims on pro-Kurdish news sites that Mehmet was shot while his hands were cuffed behind his back. The decision by these young men to fight in urban areas has forced thousands of families to flee their homes and left others trapped. Ahmad Yasar, a father of seven who runs a restaurant just inside the old city walls, was part of a delegation that pleaded with them not to entrench themselves in the middle of their city. ""A group of us, shopkeepers and tradesmen, went to those streets and said: this is wrong,"" he said. ""Of course they didn't listen to us. They didn't care what we said."" But there is also sympathy for their circumstances. Umit, an artist whose old basalt house has been damaged by the clashes, said that the youths had no other prospects. ""Those streets are the only thing in their hands,"" he said. ""It's about their very existence."" Though it supports the PKK's stated aim of greater Kurdish autonomy, it is unclear to what extent the YDG-H youth movement is controlled by older, more established insurgents. In November, the PKK leader Cemil Bayik denied that the two organisations were linked. But, just months before the group was formed, Murat Karayilan, head of a PKK umbrella group, called for a ""youth revolution"" against state policies in the south-east. Bill Park, a visiting scholar at Tobb Etu University in Ankara, said that, while ""nothing happens in the south-east without the PKK"", the youth campaign appeared to be at least partly ""improvised"". He added: ""I'm sure that the PKK is not in full control."" The agenda for a meeting between David Cameron and his Turkish counterpart Ahmet Davutoglu yesterday was due to include Turkey's role in the battle against Isis and efforts to stem the refugee crisis. Given the scale of those two tasks alone, Britain and Turkey's other Western allies are anxious for the Kurdish conflict to be halted as soon as possible. The stories told on the streets of Diyarbakir offer worrying signs about the prospects for long-lasting peace. ""Our generation is the one that you can talk with, hold negotiations with,"" said Mr Yasar, the weary restaurant owner. ""This new generation is more radical. They feel that they have no link with this country.""",0

Under plans being discussed by officials in Brussels, legal responsibility for deporting people deemed to be economic migrants would pass from the member states to the European Union. The proposal - which would have legal force - will be discussed at the meeting of EU interior and justice ministers later this month. Read more: Europe is treating refugees like convicted criminals6 charts and a map that show where refugees are coming fromVolunteers join convoy to take asylum seekers to Austria At the same time the Commission will draw up a list of ""safe countries of origin"". Migrants from these countries would be returned, because the EU considers them to be sufficiently stable. The list is expected to include all the Balkan States, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Senegal and a number of other African countries. The plan would mean that Frontex - the EU agency that currently acts as the liaison point for individual member states' border controls - would take on new legal responsibilities. It would be able to arrange the deportation of people deemed to be economic migrants from across the EU as well as possibly managing the relocation of refugees across Europe. On 9 September, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, will present a plan to relocate 120,000 Syrians, Iraqis and Eritreans who have already entered the EU to states across the union. This is in addition to the relocation of 40,000 asylum-seekers previously proposed. Britain is not expected to take part in the relocation programme as it has an opt-out on EU justice and home affairs issues under the Lisbon Treaty. David Cameron has pledged that the UK would welcome ""thousands"" of Syrian refugees under a separate scheme. The EU plan will need to overcome the opposition of Spain and several East European countries which have previously opposed the redistribution of refugees. Two months ago EU leaders rejected Commission plans for a similar compulsory quota scheme and agreed to share out only 32,000 asylum-seekers - short of the original 40,000 target. Mr Juncker's address is expected to kick off a move to agree a new plan ahead of an emergency meeting of EU justice and home affairs ministers on 14 September. Frontex was established in 2004 to reinforce and streamline co-operation between national border authorities. But under the new plan its responsibilities and powers would be hugely extended, which would bring closer the reality of a single European border force. It could still run into difficulties as the plan would need approval not just from member states but also the European Parliament. However it is likely to be welcomed by some member states including the Hungarians, who are keen for a tougher line on immigration across the Continent. ""If we don't discuss the real issue, which is the border control, we can divert the discussion in the wrong direction,"" said Viktor Orban, the Hungarian Prime Minister. ""Without providing strict border control, just to speak about a quota system - it's an invitation for those who would like to come. That's a problem."" The political tensions undermining the EU's response to the refugee crisis were exposed at the start of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on 4 September. Countries such as Germany and Italy called for the EU rapidly to put in place a common asylum system or face the collapse of its cherished right to free movement. ""If we have learnt anything from the last three, four weeks it's that we won't overcome this crisis if we keep pointing fingers at each other,"" said Germany's Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. He urged countries to back the joint push by France and Germany for a binding quota system for handling refugees.

""The problem is not so much about quotas,"" he said. ""The real problem is that we need a common right of asylum."" Current EU rules - known as the Dublin Regulation - which make refugees the responsibility of the first EU country they reach do not work any more, Mr Gentiloni said. ""Those fleeing wars or bloody dictatorships don't want to stay in the first country they reach. They want to come to Europe. ""If we go on with this conflict of everyone against the other we risk jeopardising free movement,"" he said, adding that ""it is not by building walls that countries can stay out of this process"".  Juncker to propose increase in refugee quotas  The European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, is to propose an increased quota system next week for the relocation of refugees. The new figure is expected to be 160,000 - up from the 40,000 previously agreed by a number of nations - with the burden distributed among the member states to ease the problems faced by Greece, Italy and Hungary. The Refugee Council has called for the British Government to consider accepting tens of thousands of refugees ""in order to make a significant difference to those struggling to survive in the region"". Refugees march from Hungary to Austria The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees suggested that the number accepted by Britain could be around 4,000, before withdrawing the number and saying a firm figure was yet to be communicated. The UNHCR has said that more than 300,000 refugees and migrants have used the sea route across the Mediterranean so far this year with almost 200,000 of them landing in Greece and a further 110,000 in Italy. The Italian government established the search-and-rescue operation Mare Nostrum in the Mediterranean in October 2013 but this was replaced last year by a smaller EU operation which largely ceased search-and-rescue missions. Italy's Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, and his ministers back the creation of an EU-wide immigration policy and an EU asylum law to ease the burden on countries on the front line.

ISABEL HUNTER reports from the Turkish border overlooking Kobani",Broadsheet,"The plumes of thick smoke seem to rise in slow motion as hundreds of Kurds train their binoculars on their city of Kobani. A black Isis flag waves on the far left of a mound to the east of the city, marking the militants' position. Overhead, the droning of unseen aircraft teases the onlookers, who will them to strike and help the Kurds in their battle for Kobani. Shellfire from Isis tanks is intermingled with Kurdish victories as the fighting moves closer towards the centre of the city. Clashes between protesters and police means that the smoke from the explosions in Kobani are seen through a haze of tear gas in Turkey. Near the border post, a group of men wait in a dusty orange field - as close as the Turkish forces will allow them to get to their homes. The desperate men say their families are in Kobani, but the Turkish guards won't let them pass into Syria. ""I had to leave my children in Kobani,"" said 60-year-old Daboye Evdo, a bag of groceries in each hand. ""There's no food there, so I had to come to get something to feed my family."" Daboye said he crossed into Turkey illegally on Sunday night. ""We ran across as fast as we could. One of the guys was shot in his foot and they took him to the Turkish hospital,"" he said. His 80-year-old uncle Hamki was not so lucky, and died of a heart attack while trying to cross three days ago. The shots of the border patrol scared him to death, Daboye said. On the other side of the barbed wire, men, women and children wait with the cows in a makeshift car park. Clouds of dust whirl at the border fence as several cars make a break for Turkey, swiftly followed by the Jandarma armoured vehicle. Most get away, but one gets stuck - its owner running away on foot. The Turkish authorities haven't allowed cars to cross, despite protests from their Kurdish owners. ""We just don't know what's in them,"" a Turkish soldier told The Independent. ""That's a big problem for us."" The border opened for two hours on Monday allowing about 400 refugees through. Most estimates put the remaining amount of civilians in Kobani at 3,000 - a number of whom are women, children, and the elderly. Turkish soldiers guard what was last week a bustling humanitarian hub and the main refugee crossing - kitted out by Turkish relief organisations, and the UN - is now barren. The processing and registration pen is empty. It seems Turkey has given up on the small town on its border, which is set to become its third occupied by Isis - alongside Jarabulus to the west and Tell Abyad to the east. ""The problem of Isis... cannot be solved via air bombardment,"" the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said during a visit to a camp for Syrian refugees. ""Right now... Kobani is about to fall."" In the Turkish town of Aligor, on the outskirts of Suruc, Sinan Kandil, 40, is surrounded by family and friends. He left Kobani and the Kurdish front line on Saturday, leaving his sons, 18 and 19, to continue the fight. His left eye is clouded, damaged by bullet that ricocheted off a door while he was fighting Isis three months ago. As the city nears devastation, its former citizens and fighters alike bemoan the lack of effectiveness of the coalition air strikes. ""We hit the tanks and then they hit the same place,"" complains Sinan. ""It's evil not to help us - Isis and the whole world are evil. Maybe if we started cutting people's heads off the world would give us weapons."" Sinan is convinced Kurdish fighters will continue to the end however, citing the force's female suicide bomber, Arin Mirkan, as the first of many. ""So many people are prepared to sacrifice themselves as a last resort,"" he said. However, while leaders defiantly insist their fighters will stay until the finish, others have fled - less than impressed with what they found. ""It was nothing like what they said on TV,"" one 26-year-old fighter, a Kurdish student from Diyarbakir, told The Independent, just two hours after he crossed back into Turkey. He said he was unable to leave his house during the day for fear of arrest by Turkish authorities for fighting with the PKK-affiliated YPG, and shamed by the Kurdish community for abandoning Kobani. ""I watched the videos on Facebook, but it's just a statistic - 10 people wounded, 10 people died. It's like TV but you can't change the channel,"" he said. Like many Turkish Kurdish fighters, he felt urged to join the battle to defend Kobani for his ""national pride"", and managed to run across the border two weeks ago. Once he arrived he said, he registered with the YPG central office and underwent three days of military training, which resulted mostly in stacking sandbags and preparing for urban warfare. ""I was told there is a big resistance force in the centre of Kobani, but there's not. Nobody is there."" KOBANI A BRIEF HISTORY Kobani started out in 1912 as a stop on the Konya-Baghdad railway and was populated by Armenian refugees fleeing the forces of the Ottoman Empire in 1915. The name ""Kobani"" may be a corruption of the word ""company"", although in Arabic the town is called Ayn al-Arab or ""the spring of the Arabs"". Kurds and other groups also moved into the town, which was developed under French rule in Syria after the end of the Ottoman Empire. Most of the population was Kurdish but also included Turkmen, Arabs and Armenians. The 2004 census gave Kobani's population as 45,000, but the outlying districts were home to hundreds of thousands of people in villages. In 2012, Kurdish People's Protection Units took over control of the own and other Kurdish areas from the Damascus government, in what was seen as a deal between Kurds and the Assad regime. As the war continued, Kobani became a haven for those escaping the fighting. Some reports say 160,000 people have left Kobani for Turkey recently.",0
4213,src_theindependent_raw6.docx,The Independent,6/7/2014,1000 words,Charlotte McDonald-Gibson,"Italian navy pleads for help saving migrant boats, saying it 'does not want a sea of death'; The rescue operation is costing £6m a month. Charlotte McDonald-Gibson reports from inside the marine control centre in Rome",Broadsheet,"Sailing in a straight line on a calm day, it would take a well-equipped boat about 10 hours to get from the Libyan coast to Lampedusa, the remote Italian island which has become a beacon for tens of thousands of desperate people seeking refuge from war or poverty. Few of these migrant boats actually make it in that time, however. With just a magnetic compass to guide them, the people packed on rubber dinghies often make dangerous diversions into choppy waters. For much of those perilous journeys, the men, women and children travel unseen among the merchant ships and fishing fleets which criss-cross the Mediterranean. Eventually they are spotted, perhaps by a fishing boat, radar system, commercial vessel or Italian naval ship. That is when their boat finally appears as a yellow dot on the screens of the Mare Nostrum control centre just outside Rome, and every minute counts as air and sea craft are dispatched to prevent another tragedy. The Italian navy launched the Mare Nostrum operation in October 2013 after 366 people died in a shipwreck off Lampedusa, in one of the worst migrant boat disasters. So far, 73,686 people have been plucked from the sea in an operation costing the Italian navy up to (EURO)8m (£6m) a month. The operation was meant to last only a few months, says Vice Admiral Filippo Maria Foffi, commander in chief of the Italian fleet. But the number of people setting sail for Europe in rickety vessels just keeps climbing, and the Italians have been left with little choice but to keep channelling resources to saving their lives, with pleas for more help from the EU largely ignored. The anti-immigrant Northern League in Italy has called for the suspension of Mare Nostrum (Our Sea), but the government is well aware that the humanitarian consequences would be immense. ""When children are put on board a boat and set adrift, no civilised nation can just watch. We need to save those children,"" says Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Italy and other Mediterranean nations argue that the migrants arriving on their shores are hoping to travel to the wealthier northern European nations. Therefore, the cost of saving them and the responsibility for rehousing them should be shared across the EU. It is an argument falling on deaf ears at a time when political parities across the bloc are still smarting from a surge in support for anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic parties at European Parliament elections in May. EU heads of state meeting in Brussels late last month were meant to discuss opening up new legal channels for economic migrants and refugees to apply to live in Europe, thus reducing the chance that they will risk their lives at sea. The EU's home affairs chief, Cecilia Malmstrom, told The Independent on Sunday in an interview ahead of the summit that she hoped more nations would come forward and offer sanctuary to Syrian refugees, calling the response so far ""pathetic"". None of these things happened; the issue was pushed off the agenda by a row over who should be the next president of the European Commission. A few days later, 100 more people were lost at sea in two separate incidents off the Italian coast. ""The reluctance of other EU member states to support Mare Nostrum and show solidarity to Italy raises worrying questions about the sustainability of this vital rescue operation,"" says Benjamin Ward, deputy Europe director for Human Rights Watch, warning that ""lives are at stake"" unless more financial and material support was forthcoming. The Italian government has not given up hope - it has just taken over the rotating six-month presidency of the EU, and Prime Minister Renzi is using this opportunity to steer his counterparts towards a more collective approach. ""The Mediterranean sea is not an Italian sea. It is the heart of Europe: that is why we need a European policy for the Mediterranean,"" he said at a press conference at the weekend, urging more investment from other member states. There is little sign so far of a sudden surge in funding from other European governments. Frontex, which monitors and helps to patrol the EU land and sea borders, has actually had its budget slightly reduced this year, despite the numbers trying to reach Europe expected to reach a record high. The agency recorded a 48 per cent jump in migrant arrivals between 2012 and 2013, the numbers surging because of the civil war in Syria and the political chaos in Libya, which has allowed the human smuggling networks to flourish. In the first four months of this year, 42,000 people entered the EU illegally - most of them in Italy - up from 12,400 in the same period last year. Mr Renzi thinks that helping to stabilise Libya and sending teams from the UN refugee agency to the country to asses asylum applications on the ground would be a crucial first step to stopping the dangerous journeys. But that is unlikely to happen before the end of summer, when the calm waters bring a surge in crossing attempts. Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, has appealed for other EU nations to provide frigates or planes, but for now the burden remains on Italy and its five naval ships which constantly patrol the Mediterranean. The Rome control room collates data from these ships and other governments and commercial entities, always on the lookout for anomalies which could signal a boat in distress. On a clear day, an average of 10 migrant boats are detected in the Mediterranean, with the navy picking up around 270 people every 24 hours. The passengers are then transferred to an Italian vessel for medical and security screening. It is just the first step in an arduous journey through overcrowded migrant processing centres and lengthy asylum procedures, but at least they are safe from drowning. ""We have to transform the Mediterranean Sea - we do not want a sea of death,"" says Rear Admiral Michele Saponaro, who oversees the operations at the naval command centre. ""I'm convinced Mare Nostrum helped to bring about this transformation.""",1
4224,src_theindependent_raw6.docx,The Independent,6/3/2014,1071 words,JOHN LICHFIELD IN PARIS AND NIGEL MORRIS DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR,"Urgent talks, angry words, but still no coherent plan to end Crimea's crisis; Crisis in Ukraine",Broadsheet,"Russia last night rebuffed western efforts to engineer a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis by refusing to enter direct talks with the new Kiev authorities in Paris. The Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had earlier also refused a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in the wings of a conference in the Elysée Palace. He had, however, shown some willingness to enter ""contact"" talks with Ukrainian officials, possibly through intermediaries. French, British and German foreign ministers had hoped that a direct meeting between Mr Lavrov and Andriy Deshchytsia, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, would signal a willingness by Moscow to scale down the confrontation in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Last night, the US Secretary of State John Kerry said he had held ""zero expectation"" that the two parties would speak directly. He said the ""intense discussions"" would continue towards a ""de-escalation"" of the crisis. ""Russia made a choice. And we have clearly stated that we believe it is the wrong choice to move troops into Crimea. Russia can now make the right choice,"" Mr Kerry said. ""We cannot and will not allow the integrity and sovereignty of the country of Ukraine to be violated."" French officials said that Mr Lavrov had refused to recognise Mr Deshchytsia's legitimacy as a representative of the Ukrainian people - sticking to Moscow's line that the change of government in Kiev last month was an ""illegal"" coup. Earlier, Mr Lavrov had also rejected Western calls for Russian forces within the Ukrainian province of Crimea to end their blockade of Ukrainian military bases. He denied that troops ringing the bases were Russian, saying they were local Russian-speaking ""self-defence forces"". A French official at the conference, originally convened to discuss Syrian refugees, said that the Russian approach was ""not helping"" to break the impasse. ""They deny that they have invaded Crimea and they do not recognise the interim Ukrainian government,"" the official said. Last night, Nato said it was suspending contacts with Russia, including planning for a joint mission on Syrian chemical weapons. The Nato Secretary-General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said officials would be stepping up engagement with Ukraine's civilian and military leadership. ""We have also decided that no staff-level civilian or military meetings with Russia will take place for now,"" he said. Yesterday's talks had been intended to lay the groundwork for an emergency summit of EU heads of state in Brussels today. EU leaders will try to agree a package of political and economic sanctions against Russia which would take effect if Moscow fails to ease its stranglehold on Ukrainian military bases in the Crimea. Officials warned last night, however, of deep fissures between EU governments, with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel reluctant to commit herself to economic punishment of Moscow which might rebound against European economies. The EU yesterday offered a Euro 15bn (£12bn) aid package to Ukraine. Brussels also announced plans to freeze the assets in European banks of 18 Ukrainian politicians and business leaders who are suspected of stealing billions in state funds. David Cameron will meet Chancellor Merkel and the French President François Hollande ahead of today's European summit. It will also be attended by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Ukraine's Prime Minister. Amid signs of strains between EU members over how to tackle the crisis, Mr Cameron told MPs yesterday that it was important the meeting showed ""unity of purpose"". He added: ""When we look at the diplomatic, economic and political steps we can take, nothing should be off the table."" British sources said Chancellor Merkel was cautious over taking action because of Germany's reliance on gas imports from Russia. One government source said: ""Unless we act together, Putin could just shrug his shoulders."" The French Foreign Minister, Laurent Fabius, said that Paris and Berlin had put forward ""building blocks"" for a possible diplomatic solution. This would involve a return to the agreement negotiated by EU foreign ministers - with broad Russian approval - on 21 February. There should, Mr Fabius said, be a ""government of union"" in Kiev and the dissolution of the extreme nationalist, right-wing militias which have allowed Moscow to paint the Ukrainian insurrection as ""fascist"". In return, Russian forces within Crimea would cease to block Ukrainian military facilities. ""The 2004 constitution [giving guarantees to Russian speakers and other linguistic minorities] would apply,"" Mr Fabius said. ""We would move towards a presidential election."" The Foreign Secretary William Hague said a key demand was for Russia's military to pull back to its Black Sea bases to show its willingness to de-escalate the crisis. Earlier in Madrid, Mr Lavrov said, when asked whether Moscow would order forces in Crimea back to their bases: ""If you mean the self-defence units created by the inhabitants of Crimea, they take no orders from us. As for the military personnel of the Black Sea Fleet, they are in their deployment sites. We will do everything not to allow any bloodshed."" Mr Hague and Mr Kerry had earlier met the Ukrainian Foreign Minister in Paris to discuss the ""Budapest memorandum"" of 1994, in which the US, Britain and Russian jointly guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty. Mr Lavrov refused to attend that meeting. ""Ukraine voluntarily surrendered the world's third-largest nuclear weapons arsenal in exchange for these assurances,"" Mr Hague and Mr Kerry said in a joint statement. ""The three governments treat these assurances with utmost seriousness, and expect Russia to [do so] as well. Russia has chosen to act unilaterally and militarily. The UK and US will continue to support Ukraine's sovereignty and we commend the new Ukrainian government for not taking actions that might escalate the situation."" Officials said the last point referred to repeated Western advice to Kiev to avoid any military action which would give Moscow an excuse to tighten its grip on Crimea or invade eastern Ukraine. Mr Deshchytsia said: ""We want to keep neighbourly relations with the Russian people. We want to settle this peacefully."" On the flight to Paris, he saidUkraine was not willing to go to war to prevent Russia from annexing Crimea but said he did not think military action would be necessary. He said Moscow would back down rather than suffer economic penalties and diplomatic isolation.",0

Halfway around the world, those terrible images of 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh moved another child, about the same age, to write a heartfelt letter to President Obama. ""Remember the boy who was picked up by the ambulance in Syria?"" 6-year-old Alex Myteberi wrote. ""Can you please go get him and bring him to our home?"" Young Alex left the president clear instructions: Obama could park in his family's driveway or on the street in front of their home in Scarsdale, N.Y., and the Myteberis would be waiting with flags, flowers and balloons. Alex already had a friend at school who was from Syria himself; he promised he would introduce him to Omran. They would play and go to birthday parties together, and Omran could teach Alex a new language. Since Omran likely wouldn't be coming with toys, Alex and his little sister, Catherine, offered to share theirs. ""We will give him a family, and he will be our brother,"" he wrote. Obama was so touched by Alex's handwritten letter that he read it out loud at a United Nations summit on refugees in September. A White House video about Alex's message went viral, with many praising the child's compassion and innocence in the face of such atrocity. ""Those are the words of a 6-year-old boy,"" Obama said at the summit, to applause. ""He teaches us a lot. The humanity that a young child can display, who hasn't learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people, because of where they're from, or how they look, or how they pray. We can all learn from Alex."" More than two months later, Alex and Obama met in person, after the White House speechwriting team invited the Myteberi family for a visit. Video of the Nov. 10 meeting, which the White House released last week, showed Obama speaking to Alex about the impact of his words. ""I liked your letter so much that I ended up reading it to everybody, and so everybody heard what you said,"" Obama said in their Oval Office meeting. ""You being so nice and kind hopefully makes other people think the same way. So I was very proud of you."" According to Alex's family, there was barely a dry eye in the house. Copyright Washington Post ""Can't even describe it in words,"" Alex's mother, Valbona Myteberi, said in an email to The Washington Post. ""When the President shook my hand and thanked us for raising compassionate kids my eyes teared up and I was trying very hard not to cry. We were pleasantly overwhelmed by the feeling of pride, respect and gratitude that we received throughout the visit."" The opportunity to meet with Obama had been a surprise, Myteberi said. The speechwriting team's invitation had come in September, but they had settled on Nov. 10 because it fit the family's schedule. The visit was to include a tour of the White House and meetings with some of the West Wing staff - but an audience with the president was never guaranteed. After all, it was two days after the election, and Obama had a packed agenda - including his first meeting with President-elect Donald Trump that morning and a South Lawn gathering with the NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers that afternoon. ""Prior to the visit we were focused on adjusting his expectations that he would probably not see the president,"" Myteberi wrote in her email. ""He had asked 'Will we meet the President? Will he be in the White House when we are there?' And we had explained that the President is a very busy man and even though he could not meet with us, this was to be a very special day, meeting with important people who work hard for our country in this very important place called the White House."" ['We will give him a family': A 6-year-old boy writes Obama about having a refugee 'brother'] Their priorities as parents, Myteberi added, were to ensure that their children were on their best behavior in the White House - and that they not stain their clothes with cookies or snacks. The adults shouldn't have worried, it turned out. ""They not only made us proud, but also had a ton of fun, playing and being themselves in the halls and offices of the West Wing, building some of the best memories that we as parents will cherish forever,"" she said. They met with White House staff for more than an hour. Even Bo and Sunny, the Obamas' two Portuguese water dogs, made an appearance in the West Wing, to the children's delight. ""Everyone wanted to meet Alex,"" Myteberi said. ""We met with a wonderful woman volunteer who had been the first to open and read Alex's letter. She was tearing and I was tearing - happy tears, of course."" And then staff told the family that Obama would be able to see them after all. It was some time after the president's meeting with Trump. ""We never thought we would meet the president,"" Myteberi said. "" . . . You can imagine what a wonderful surprise this was for us as parents and certainly for Alex and Catherine. A great honor."" Video of the meeting showed Alex appearing star-struck and at a loss for words as Obama shook his hand. ""It's so nice to meet you! How have you been?"" the president told him. ""You look very nice in your suit."" ""Thank you,"" Alex said quietly, smiling. He confirmed to Obama it was a new suit.

Their meeting with Obama lasted maybe 10 minutes. Alex - who loves cars and aircraft - asked the president a question about his helicopter, his mother said. They left with a letter that Obama wrote to Alex, expressing his confidence that if more people embraced his kind of compassion, the world would be a better place. Obama signed the letter, dated Nov. 8, and added a handwritten line at the bottom: ""I'm very proud of you!"" Myteberi said that her son continues to inquire about Omran, the injured Syrian boy whose image spurred him to write the letter in the first place. ""He's genuinely concerned about Omran, and asks about him on a regular basis,"" Myteberi said. ""We as parents try to help him understand that Omran is safe with his family and friends. It's a very complicated matter to explain to a 6-year-old boy what's going on in Syria and why children are getting hurt."" According to an earlier report by The Post, Omran's 10-year-old brother, Ali, died of his injuries after the airstrike. An estimated 20 percent of the nearly half-million killed since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 were children. Of the country's 4.3 million refugees, at least half are children. Millions of Syrian children are not able to attend school. Millions have known nothing but war in their short lives. The United States says it has taken in more than 10,000 Syrian refugees this year, bringing the total to just over 30,000. That number, and the number of refugees accepted into other wealthy countries in the Arab and Western worlds, pales in comparison with the number accepted in the countries abutting Syria. The vast majority of those who have fled Syria are now living in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. Max Bearak contributed to this article.",0

""Can you imagine a situation when we send an army to fight in Syria while hundreds of thousands of Syrians sit and drink coffee on Berlin's Unter den Linden and watch us fight for their safety? ""They can go to fight to liberate their country with our help,"" said the minister, who took office yesterday following the victory of the conservative Law and Justice party in last month's Polish general election. The idea of forming an army of migrants also made sense on the ground that Poland could scarcely afford to send its troops to the Middle East, the minister explained. Mr Waszczykowski said that the Polish army was needed at home to guard the country's eastern border in case the Ukraine war flared up again and there was a threat to national security. Taking a sceptical stance on the motives behind Syrians coming to Europe, Mr Waszczykowski also claimed that the ""young men disembark from their rubber dinghies with iPad in hand and, instead of asking for drink or food, they ask where they can charge their cellphones"". In the wake of the Paris attacks the minister said that Poland would now vet all asylum applicants for security threats, and said that any ""shadow on their CVs"" would result in their claims being rejected.

However, it is understood the move will not be straight away because the building is being redecorated. The rent will be reportedly paid for by charitable funds under the Archbishop of Canterbury's personal control. A spokesman said: ""We don't know when exactly it's going to happen. We have got one cottage that could house a family, but the Archbishop wants to get it refurbished first."" She said the cottage in the palace grounds was currently being redecorated and could provide room for a ""family or two"". She added: ""As a Christian who leads the Church of England, it is something he feels absolutely passionate about. ""As the Archbishop has said, Jesus was a refugee, and there are refugees here who are desperate for sanctuary from war-torn places, and the Archbishop is completely torn about their situation and wants to make a difference."" Archbishop Welby had been reportedly thinking about housing Syrian refugees for a while. Earlier this month, he is understood to have met the Prime Minister as concerns grew that Christians in Syria will be largely excluded from the 20,000 refugees due to come to Britain over the next few years. He raised the issue with David Cameron during a private meeting, a source told The Daily Telegraph. The Government has expressed its commitment to house refugees from UN camps in Syria and neighbouring countries, in line with European Union policy. This means it is not able to discriminate against any religious denomination. However, the Archbishop has raised concerns that Christians have avoided going to refugee camps because of fears that they will be persecuted by Islamist groups. Archbishop Welby is not the first religious leader to offer to house Syrian refugees. Pope Francis has already said two refugee families would move into Vatican housing.

More than 3,300 migrants landed on Spanish shores in the first four months of 2017, up from 1,063 in the same period last year, the UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said. The report followed a surge in boat arrivals over the past week. Yesterday, the Spanish coastguard rescued more than 100 migrants from three boats near Alborán, a rocky island outpost halfway between Spain and Morocco. In the past week, more than 200 people, including a number of pregnant women, were picked up along the Andalusian coastline in half a dozen boats, more than half of them on Saturday alone. On Sunday, a rubber dinghy carrying 34 people, including nine women, caught fire when its outboard motor exploded 16 miles off Alborán. The flaming vessel was spotted by the Portuguese air force, patrolling as part of the EU's Frontex operation, as its passengers leapt into the waves. With the aid of a local fishing vessel and the Spanish coastguard, all of them were pulled out alive. Spain has now surpassed Greece in the numbers of migrants dying in its waters. Fifty one migrants have been killed crossing the Mediterranean to Spain this year, while 37 have died in the Aegean Sea, where the EU's migrant deal with Turkey has deterred many from attempting the journey. The crossing to Italy - accounting for 80 per cent of European arrivals by sea - remains by far the most deadly, with almost 1,500 people killed in 2017. Almost 59,000 migrants have traversed the Mediterranean to Italy this year, a nearly 50 per cent rise on the same period in 2016, when just over 40,000 made the journey. But the latest figures indicate that the Western Mediterranean route, from Morocco to Spain, is re-establishing itself after years of waning activity. While the proximity of the two countries has historically made this an entry point to Europe, co-operation between Moroccan and Spanish authorities kept migration relatively low. One of the reasons for the route's growth is thought to be the effective closure of the passage through Greece and the Balkans. The EU's deal with Turkey, under which Syrian refugees arriving in Greece are to be processed and sent back to Turkey, has led to a huge drop in crossings. So far this year 7,043 migrants have taken the Eastern Mediterranean route to Greece, according to the IOM figures, down from 156,267 over the same period in 2016. The majority of the migrants crossing from Morocco to Spain hail from sub-Saharan Africa, though Syrian refugees are also known to use the route. A decade ago it was mostly favoured by economic migrants from north Africa, but now increasing conflict in countries such as Mali, Sudan, Nigeria and the Central African Republic is now also fuelling the push northwards. Maria J Vega, spokesman for UNHCR in Spain, said: ""It is a worrying situation - this increase means that there are more people desperately trying to reach safe countries and they are risking their lives at the hands of smugglers and traffickers.""

Since David Cameron is seeking to change Britain's EU membership, the balance of power and opinion in a significant member like Poland matters. The victory of Poland's Law and Justice Party is not an unqualified positive for Mr Cameron, since the party is strongly committed to EU rules that allow some of our Polish visitors to claim British benefits for children who have never set foot in this country, an unacceptable situation Mr Cameron has rightly promised to end. But the wider message of the election is welcome, because of what it reveals about Poland's attitude to the centralising European Franco-German ""project"". The EU recently forced Poland to accept a quota of Syrian refugees, something firmly against the wishes of the Polish people, who have now dismissed the government which accepted that quota. Poles want a government driven by Poland's national interest, not a supranational project designed in Paris, Berlin and Brussels. Law and Justice is also understandably cool on joining the euro and rightly concerned that eurozone nations should not dictate to those with the good sense to retain their own currencies. Poland's election has put another nail in the coffin of the misguided notion of an ""ever-closer union"" for all the EU's members. It signals a growing appetite for a multi-speed Europe where members can participate in - or abstain from - the programmes and policies that suit them, without pressure to integrate.

The assailant has been identified only as Rafik Y, a 41-year-old Iraqi who had already served a prison sentence in Germany for his part in a 2004 terror plot. Police were called to Berlin's Spandau district yesterday morning after members of the public reported a ""madman with a knife"". The man attacked a woman police officer as she got out of her patrol car, stabbing her in the neck just above her protective vest. The officer's partner immediately drew his gun and shot him four times. The woman officer, who has not been named, was rushed to emergency surgery and was said to be out of danger last night. As well as the wound to her neck, she was hit in the kidney by a stray bullet. Four more patrol cars arrived and at least one other police officer is believed to have opened fire. Paramedics attempted to resucitate the attacker at the scene but he died in an ambulance on his way to hospital. He was identified as one of three men found guilty of a plot to assassinate the former Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi during a visit to Berlin in 2004. They were also convicted of membership of Ansar al-Islam, a jihadist group with links to Al-Qaeda. Rafik Y was sentenced to eight years for his part in the plot at the 2008 trial. He was released early in 2013 but electronically tagged and allowed to remain in Germany. Bild newspaper claimed the electronic tag had only been removed from his leg hours before the attack.

And this knowing adaptation by Rev creator James Woods does it justice, tiptoeing skilfully through Waugh's minefield of scabrous humour. The second episode sees the accidentally disgraced Paul Pennyfeather (Jack Whitehall) moving up in the world once again as he leaves the dreadful public school in Wales at which he's been exiled to take up a position as tutor to the son of the wealthy Margot Beste-Chetwynde (Eva Longoria). The best of the laughs come early on while Pennyfeather is still in Wales attending the marriage of the dissolute Captain Grimes (Douglas Hodge) to the daughter of headmaster Mr Fagin (David Suchet). There follows some slightly treadworn lampooning of the pretensions of the privileged classes as Pennyfeather negotiates 1920s high society, but happily it's not long before he's heading for choppy waters again, thanks to his lamblike blindness to the source of Mrs Beste-Chetwynde's fortune.

4529,src_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,15/3/2016,394 words,NA,Angela Merkel is no longer indomitable,Broadsheet,"Ayear ago, Angela Merkel was indisputably Europe's most powerful politician, by dint of her longevity as Germany's chancellor and the strength of her country's economy. Her writ ran far beyond Germany's borders: in order to get anything serious done in the EU, Mrs Merkel needed to be on board. Yet with one fateful decision, she risked her position. Her invitation to refugees and immigrants to come to Germany last summer has arguably undermined her own government and damaged the cohesion of the EU, perhaps terminally. The results from the state elections in Germany on Sunday are a straw in the wind. They were not a definitive rejection of Mrs Merkel's immigration policy, because some centre parties did well and most votes were still cast for parties supporting the Chancellor's approach. But the success of the antiimmigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, once a centre-Right movement now infiltrated by more unsavoury elements, suggests that a growing number of voters no longer trust her handling of the refugee crisis. It has reshaped the European political landscape and provides a problematic backdrop for David Cameron to campaign against as he tries to keep the UK in the EU especially when, as we report today, one third of undecided voters say their biggest hesitation in supporting Remain is concern over immigration. In welcoming refugees, Mrs Merkel encouraged a movement of people into Europe that her own country is unwilling to absorb. Now she insists that other member states, which had no choice in the matter, accept immigrants they don't want. In addition, the crisis has led to concessions being given to Turkey, from where most of the immigrants are coming, that have alarmed many Europeans. Not only will Turks have visa-free access to the Schengen area and receive some (EURO)6 billion to look after Syrian refugees, but the EU will speed up Ankara's application to join the EU, even if no one expects such a request to succeed. True, there are indications that the numbers crossing into Greece have started to fall as the Turkish authorities stop refugees boarding boats - something they should have done long ago. But thousands remain stranded, despite promises to relocate them on a quota basis. Perhaps Mrs Merkel can turn this crisis around; but if her aura of indomitability has gone for good, she has only herself to blame.",1

The spectre of plunging temperatures as refugees brave the perilous sea journey to Europe has also raised fears that many will face hypothermia, with increasing number of cases already been reported by aid workers. The Department for International Development, which has already donated £20 million to the Europe-wide aid effort, said the new funding would be allocated through a network of aid groups in Greece, Serbia and Macedonia. Among other things, the money will help buy sleeping bags, towels, rain wear and nappies. ""The crisis is worsening and the number of people fleeing the conflict, persecution and hopelessness in Syria is growing,"" said Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary. ""The UK can be proud of the help we're giving."" Calling on other nations to step up funding, Ms Greening warned that a failure to do so would result in a rise in ""the numbers of desperate people on our doorstep"". Britain has been criticised for its sluggish approach to the resettlement of Syrian refugees, refusing to take part in a European scheme that would involve mandatory quotas. Instead, it has promised to resettle 4,000 refugees this year and 20,000 over five years. The EU said yesterday that it was allocating an extra (EURO)28 million (£20 million) to Jordan to help it meet the urgent needs of refugees fleeing the war in Syria. Christos Stylianides, the EU humanitarian affairs commissioner, made the announcement during a visit to the Zaatari camp in northern Jordan. The site is home to some 80,000 Syrians. Tensions in Europe have flared over the refugee crisis with states such as Italy and Germany arguing that they have borne the brunt of a disaster for which responsibility should be equally shared. The overall EU humanitarian assistance allocated since Syria's war began in 2011 now stands at £141 million. Jordan said it has taken in 1.4 million Syrians fleeing the war. About 80 per cent live outside formal camps and many struggle to make ends meet. As the crisis grows, the heads of the UN and the Red Cross made what they called an ""unprecedented joint warning"" for states to stop conflicts, respect international law and aid refugees.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president and the man Europe hopes can hold back a new wave of migrants, ridiculed an offer of visas, cash and a fresh chapter of accession talks drawn up by European leaders last night. If Brussels wants his co-operation, nothing less than full EU membership will do, the president said, adding that the offer did not appear to be ""sincere"". ""The West and Europe's security and stability is contingent on our security and stability,"" he said. ""They have accepted this now. So if it can't happen without Turkey, why don't you take Turkey into the EU? The problem is clear, but they are not open."" Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is preparing to travel to Turkey this weekend to try to build momentum for a workable deal with Mr Erdogan. Diplomatic sources said that Mrs Merkel would be ""crucial"" in helping to stand up a deal that was agreed in outline in Brussels this week, but analysts warned that she still faces mounting political hurdles both inside Turkey and among some EU member states. European leaders made no effort to conceal that the proposed agreement reflects hard-headed realpolitik, offering sweeteners and large sums of cash in order to halt what the deal text calls a ""massive influx"" of refugees. ""An agreement with Turkey makes sense only if it effectively contains the flow of refugees,"" said Donald Tusk, the European Council president. Despite criticism from liberal sources that the EU was ""outsourcing"" its border policy, there is growing urgency in Brussels to get a deal in place before the deteriorating Syrian civil war precipitates a new wave of refugees. Already some 350,000 people have attempted to cross from Turkey to Greece since last month, with just 50,000 stopped by the Turkish police. But with Syrian government forces starting their assault in the northern province of Aleppo yesterday, analysts have warned that another 3.5 million refugees could flee the country if the opposition stronghold is overrun by forces loyal to the Assad regime. Mrs Merkel said that Europe was ""ready to share the burden"" of the refugees with Turkey, so long as Ankara made commitments as to their proper treatment. ""We still must clarify the timelines, what should happen, when, how reliable our promises of support are, how reliable Turkey's promises of regulation are,"" she said. But it is unclear whether Mr Erdogan could even implement the Turkish side of the bargain as he faces a parliamentary election on Nov 1 where his AKP party is trying to regain its majority. Polls show a majority of Turkish public opinion is now against allowing Syrian refugees to settle in Turkey. The deal will also face hurdles in Europe where François Hollande, the French president, warned: ""Liberalisation of visas with Turkey should be on extremely specific, controlled terms.""",1

The White House is already struggling to quell dissent and mistrust within the National Security Council (NSC), where many civil servants feel their advice is being ignored, taking to calling the new administration ""the regime"". Mr Trump and Mike Pence, the vicepresident, are discussing Mr Flynn's future, according to Sean Spicer, the president's press secretary. Other White House sources claimed that ""the knives are out"" for the retired general. Mr Flynn, who was previously forced to resign as head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, stands accused of discussing the lifting of sanctions on Moscow with the Russian ambassador in Washington before Mr Trump took office, in an act which may be illegal. The White House previously said that he had contacted the ambassador in December for a Christmas greeting, but this account was challenged by recordings of the conversation by an intelligence agency. The NSC has traditionally brought together expertise from intelligence and defence agencies, advising the president on everything from counterterrorism and foreign policy to nuclear deterrence. But in the first three weeks of the new administration, staffers have found themselves increasingly shut out of the West Wing, with decisions largely being made without adhering to their reports, as protocol dictates. Sources who asked not to be named for fear of retribution told The Daily Telegraph they are worried about the White House's impatience with bureaucracy and disregard for the institutions of government. At a recent meeting with NSC civil servants, Mr Flynn reportedly answered a question relating to these concerns by telling staff that, having won the election, this was the White House's prerogative. Mr Trump's decision to include Steve Bannon, his chief strategist, as a key decision maker in NSC meetings has also been seen as a dangerous break with a US tradition in which political operatives are kept out of decisions that are critical to national security. Further concerns over security protocol were raised yesterday after it emerged that Mr Trump had responded from his dinner table in a public setting to the news at the weekend that North Korea had test-fired a ballistic missile. Mr Trump had been dining with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, at his Mar-a-Lago club, surrounded by dozens of club members. Aides surrounded the leaders, and used flashlights on their mobile phones to shine light on maps and documents that were laid out over the silverware. Security experts condemned the casual approach to national security discussions, with some suggesting foreign powers could have hacked the phone's cameras. Guests at the private members' resort posted pictures of the incident on social media, as well as other pictures of the president's visit, including one taken with an aide who purportedly carried the nuclear codes. Interviewing dozens of civil servants on the frustrations felt by the NSC, the New York Times reported that many staff are kept in the dark about the substance of Mr Trump's calls with foreign leaders. Yesterday Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, met Mr Trump at the White House, becoming the third world leader to visit the new president. Mr Trudeau said that despite their disagreements he would not ""lecture"" the US president on Syrian refugees.

The German authorities expect 920,000 asylum seekers to arrive between October and December, according to the classified figures. With each refugee having an estimated four to eight family members who could be permitted to enter, the total number resettled could ultimately top seven million. The figure is drastically higher than the official estimate that Germany would host 800,000 asylum seekers this year and could lead to further pressure on Angela Merkel. It will also shock EU leaders, some of whom have criticised Germany's willingness to accept large numbers of refugees who they say could eventually end up in other countries under freedom of movement rules. The EU is discussing a proposal to offer another half a million Syrians asylum in Europe by airlifting them from Turkey in an attempt to stem the flow of refugees risking their lives making the sea crossing to Greece or Italy. The idea is thought to be among plans put to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who met EU leaders in Brussels yesterday, to encourage him to tighten border controls. The German government has not confirmed the new asylum estimate. Sigmar Gabriel, the vice-chancellor, has previously conceded that the figure of 800,000 may be too low. ""For the fourth quarter, we now expect 7,000 to 10,000 illegal border crossings a day,"" said the classified report, which was leaked to Bild. ""This high number of asylum seekers threatens to be an extreme burden on state and local governments."" Mrs Merkel has come under increasing pressure over her refugee policy in recent days, after an opinion poll showed her approval rating had fallen to its lowest in four years. Thousands of people took to the streets in eastern Germany to protest against the influx over the weekend and a refugee shelter was set on fire in the latest in a series of arson attacks. Mrs Merkel insisted that Germany could cope and defended her decision to take in thousands of refugees from Hungary last month. Thomas de Maiziere, the interior minister, last night called for the government to restrict the number of refugees coming to Germany, adding pressure on Mrs Merkel. ""Our capabilities are limited,"" he said. The European Commission has blocked a proposal by Mr de Maiziere to set up airport-style transit zones on the border with Austria. EU officials, meanwhile, have claimed that the Turkish authorities have stopped just 50,000 of the 350,000 refugees who have tried to travel to Greece since January. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, who met Mr Erdogan yesterday, said he expected Turkey to act. ""Europe has to manage its border better. We expect Turkey to do the same,"" he said. EU sources said they were considering an offer to relocate about 500,000 Syrian refugees. That could reignite a row among nations that opposed the plan to find places for 160,000 people already inside the EU. The EU has so far taken in just 22,000 people directly from countries neighbouring Syria. In another overture to Mr Erdogan, Mr Tusk said he would consider proposals to use the military to create a ""safe zone"" within Syria to absorb refugees, something officials think would be far-fetched given likely opposition from Russia. He also said that more financial assistance was on the table. Turkish offi-cials say they have spent $7.5 billion on hosting refugees but have been offered just $417 million in aid from the UN, the EU and other international donors. In a boost to Mr Erdogan before Turkish parliamentary elections next month, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said he was ""strongly in favour"" of speeding up a deal that will allow Turkey's 75 million people to travel to Europe without visas. Sources said the visas were ""linked"" to Turkey controlling its borders.",1

Radhika Sanghani finds out why,Broadsheet,"Earlier this year, Marco Robinson announced that he would give away a house. The self-made British entrepreneur - estimated to be worth £25million - said he would dip into his 150-wide property portfolio and donate a £120,000 three-bedroom flat in Preston, Lancashire, to whoever he felt deserved it. Eight months and 8,000 applicants later, the 49-year-old has done just that. And tonight, his journey to find someone to benefit from his unusual act of philanthropy will be featured in a Channel 4 documentary, Get a House for Free. ""I wanted to give back,"" explains Robinson, who has previously done something similar in America. ""Very few people can afford to own anymore, with rents and house prices going up. Social housing is a huge issue. There's very little Government help - it's near impossible to get a mortgage and even people working full time can't buy. It's a mess."" Homelessness is a subject close to Robinson's heart. His mother left the turbulent family home when he was just two, and the pair often had to sleep rough across Derbyshire and London as she struggled to pay rent. By the age of 10, Robinson had been to more than 20 schools, and was homeless on-and-off into his teens. He left education at 16 to work as a cleaner and, in his twenties, found a job in sales and started to earn enough to live comfortably. But it was only in 2008, after being fired and separating from the mother of his two children, that he came up with a million-pound business idea: creating a travel rewards scheme for employees at firms such as Citibank and BMW. From there, he expanded into property investment and founded luxury brand the Naked Group, which boasts a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur (winner of Tatler's Best Restaurant Award 2015), as well as beauty salons, coffee, travel, wines and even a film foundation in the UK. ""Being homeless was one of the reasons I wanted to give people a home in a way I didn't have myself,"" admits Robinson, who had a heart attack aged 29 as a result of his high-pressure lifestyle, and is now a clean eating convert. His journey to find the most deserving applicant sees him meet the likes of 18-year-old single mother Holly (""I feel like I'm stuck at the bottom of the pit and I can't climb out"") and a family of Syrian refugees (""We're homeless. We have nowhere to go but the street""). ""It was overwhelming,"" says Robinson, quietly. ""Choosing who to give it to was the most difficult decision of my life."" The experience also opened his eyes to the plight of foreigners in the UK. Robinson admits that, in the past, he had joined in with criticism of immigrants for taking opportunities away from Brits - but quickly changed his mind: ""They were just struggling human beings. Some were amazing in terms of their dignity and humility."" He also changed his children's attitudes to money. Paige, 20, and Saul, 17, accompanied him on some of the quest, and Robinson credits it with helping them to accept his decision not to leave them a financial inheritance. ""When I die, I don't want anything left at all in my bank account. I help my kids but I don't give them money. They were becoming a bit entitled. Meeting these people gave them perspective. It made them want to do something for the community."" Robinson can't reveal the winner but says he is confident he made the right decision: ""I felt the people I gave it to were the most deserving. They had a lot going for them but, through no fault of their own, were in very sticky circumstances. My goal was always to give it to people who had a fantastic work ethic - a way out of a situation they'd stumbled into. [I wanted] to know they'd actually turn their lives around."" He adds it was ""one of the most amazing things"" he has ever done, and hopes other millionaires will follow his lead. ""There are people so much richer than I am. I want them to join me and give a house away to someone who needs it. I can't wait to do it again.""

Born on a moving coal truck that was carrying dying prisoners and diseased bodies, Eva Clarke, 70, is one of the youngest survivors of the Holocaust. Her mother, Anka, weighing little more than five stone, managed to hide her pregnancy while she was toiling in Auschwitz (where her husband died) and at an armament factory in Freiberg. But when she rolled into Mauthausen on April 29 in 1945, the death camp set in a perversely pretty nook of Austria, her waters broke with the shock of arriving at what she believed was her final destination. And so it would have been had the flailing Nazis not run out of Zyklon B gas the day before. Mrs Clarke told me her remarkable tale in a packed Westminster hall filled with parliamentarians, students and fellow survivors at the Holocaust Educational Trust's annual lecture. In a further twist, two other corpselike women had also just given birth upon arriving in Mauthausen, but they never met. Incredibly, these two tiny malnourished children also survived the genocide, along with their determined mothers, and six decades later the three ""miracle babies"" finally found each other. They are now so close they refer to themselves as ""siblings of the heart"". It's a story which defies belief. Even 71 years after the end of the Second World War, we struggle to comprehend how these barbaric acts could have been carried out - even at the time, people didn't want to believe. And that is one of the reasons why a well-intentioned but incredibly dull video, ""A Message from Syrian Mothers"", from the Metropolitan police, aiming to stop British women from joining Isil, is falling flat. Helen Ball, the senior national coordinator for counterterrorism policing in the UK, kicks off the film: ""We are deeply concerned about the number of women, girls and whole families who are making the decision to travel to Syria,"" she unemotionally explains to camera. ""They are unaware of the dangers they face when they get there and the reality of living in a war-torn country. They are unaware they may not be able to return to their families and they leave behind devastated friends and families."" The video is all the more important now we know that 56 British women made the foolish journey to Syria last year. But no one is tuning in; unlike the thousands viewing Isil's gory beheading videos and poring over fantasy articles about an Islamic utopia. Isil propaganda machine 1; UK Government 0. The Met's video does pack more of a punch when female Syrian refugees take to the screen and tearfully beg privileged Western women to come to their senses. But it's hardly the rallying cry that's needed. Posted on the Prevent Tragedies website, which was set up by the police to counter the malign influence of terrorist groups, the video had attracted 3,979 views at the time of writing (and at least three of which were from my computer). And I doubt the audience will grow exponentially any time soon. It means well, but it just isn't a strong enough pitch. Isil, meanwhile, knows only too well how to grab people's attention - with horrific drama. So the moment has come to fight the terrorist propaganda with powerful propaganda of our own. As haunting photos of living skeletons emerge from the besieged Syrian town of Madaya, eerily reminiscent of how Holocaust survivors once looked, we are again struggling to understand what is going on in a country riven by war. Will these images of starving families change young minds, where the mothers' video pleas failed? Possibly. But we need to go further. Where Isil relies on its barbarity to recruit followers, we need something clever, something equally dramatic to prevent our children from travelling to Syria. We are a country and culture at war. David Cameron might not have announced it formally on the radio like in analogue times gone by - but this is truly a battle of hearts and minds. In order to stop the flow of recruits to Isil, the UK, alongside its allies, needs to start producing some clever online content that speaks to the whole nation, as well as those tempted by caliphate life. Just like those posters from the First and Second World Wars which spurred the country to unite in the war effort, modern day digital campaigns need to do the same. The vast majority of British Muslims do not live separate lives. They may have different customs and beliefs, just as Christians, Jews and Hindus do. But all law-abiding citizens of this country need to feel like they are part of one society that accepts them, and unites with them against the terrorists who threaten our existence. The political scientist Samuel Huntington predicted in 1992 that the big battle in the post-Cold War world would be a clash of civilisations. Well the British people are civilised and Isil imbeciles are not. It's time to remind all parts of our society which side they are on and, more importantly, want to be on.

The 47-year-old, now threatened with beheading by jihadists, ignored pleas from friends, colleagues and local guides not to cross the Syrian border, telling them that he was determined to make sure the supplies he was carrying were delivered safely to the right people.  Mr Henning was driving an ambulance on behalf of Rochdale Aid 4 Syria, which raised money on behalf of Al-Fatiha Global, a registered charity under investigation by the Charity Commission after one of its leaders was photographed with his arms around two hooded fighters carrying machine guns.  Aid 4 Syria has also used its Facebook page to promote an event called O'Ummah Wake Up And Rise! at which the guest speakers were Zahir Mahmood and Moazzam Begg. Mr Mahmood has described the terrorist group Hamas as ""freedom fighters"", while Mr Begg, a former detainee at Guantánamo Bay, has admitted fighting in Bosnia.  The team leader of the convoy was Kasim Jameel, who was arrested in July on child pornography and sexual assault charges before being released on police bail. The investigation remains active.  Mr Jameel has posted messages on his Facebook page, including: ""Our men love death like your men love life,"" paraphrasing Osama bin Laden's comment: ""We love death. The US loves life. That is the difference between us two.""  There is no suggestion that Mr Henning, a father of two from Eccles, Greater Manchester, knew of the apparent links between the charities and extremism.  Al-Fatiha Global was only placed under investigation in March - three months after Mr Henning was kidnapped, after Adeel Ali - the son of one of its trustees, was pictured with gunmen on the front of The Sun newspaper.  Mr Henning, a taxi driver, knows Mr Ali ""quite well"" as he had been part of previous convoys.  After his capture, Mr Henning told other hostages ""don't worry about me"", believing that he would be freed ""in no time because I'm just an aid worker"".  Harald Doorbos, a Dutch reporter, told the BBC that he had interviewed another hostage who was held with Mr Henning and was later rescued by the Free Syrian Army.  Mr Doorbos said: ""He rather naively, maybe, thought it was all going to be OK, that it was some kind of misunderstanding because Henning was an aid worker helping Syrian refugees.""  The reporter said that security had been stepped up by the kidnappers when Mr Henning was brought in, and he was moved the next day.  A fellow volunteer who travelled in the same vehicle as Mr Henning on his fateful journey to Syria said that locals pleaded with him not to cross the border.  The friend, who asked not to be named, said: ""It was very dangerous, and Alan knew that.  ""When we got to the Syrian border, we didn't have any security or anything. We just had local people with us, guides who knew the area.  ""At the border, some of the local people told us not to go near their villages because we were British, even though we were carrying aid. They thought Isil would come and they said it wasn't safe.  ""But Alan wanted to go in because he wanted to deliver the aid to the people. He was determined to go across the border, and so were all the rest of us.""  He said that Mr Henning's ambulance was ""about half an hour into Syria"" when he and his fellow drivers were abducted.  ""The rest of the guys were British Muslims and they were released pretty quickly, but not Alan,"" said the friend. ""We didn't see him again.""  Mr Henning's colleagues in Manchester had also pleaded with him to stay at home.  One fellow taxi driver said: ""He just said he wanted to go and help people out there. That was the kind of caring person he was. Even when we all said, 'Look, you will be the only white man out there, it's not safe', he didn't listen. He had so much conviction so there was no talking him out of it.""  Mr Henning worked for a firm called Mini Cabs but rented his taxi from another company. His colleague said: ""The owners of that [other] firm are Pakistani I believe. That's who he went there [Syria] with but none of them got taken - only him.  ""We told him time and time again not to go, but because he had been twice before he just said, 'I'll be fine, I managed the last two times'.""  Mr Henning, nicknamed Gadget because of his love of technology, has diabetes and his friends are worried that his health will have deteriorated without access to his regular medication. He was part of a convoy of 20 vehicles making the 4,000-mile journey to Idlib in northwest Syria when he was kidnapped on Boxing Day last year.  Trustees of Al Fatiha Global last night refused to comment on the convoy or Mr Henning's participation.

Sources close to Nick Clegg said the Liberal Democrat leader had repeatedly raised the issue with the Prime Minster, with more than 2.3 million Syrian refugees now stranded near its borders. The Cabinet split emerged as Mr Cameron indicated that he would consider giving sanctuary to some of the most vulnerable refugees. Ministers had previously insisted Britain would not participate in a UN scheme to resettle 30,000 people in refugee camps. However, Mr Clegg is now pushing Mr Cameron to go much farther and formally sign up to accepting Syrian refugees under the UN programme. Germany is taking 10,000 under the scheme and France 500. ""This would be targeted assistance for the most vulnerable, and providing refuge to those in need is one of Britain's greatest, oldest traditions,"" said a source. ""We are one of the most openhearted countries in the world and Nick believes we have a moral responsibility to help. ""The coalition Government has been the most generous in the world when it comes to helping with the humanitarian crisis in Syria and it would be selfdefeating to allow ourselves to be painted as the least generous. ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case around the Cabinet table. We have yet to gain the agreement of our Conservative colleagues, but we remain hopeful that we will."" Lib Dem Cabinet ministers hope to resolve the dispute by next Wednesday, when Labour will attempt to embarrass the Government by calling a Commons vote on the issue. A YouGov poll for The Times found that the public are not in favour of accepting refugees. Asked if Britain should accept ""a few hundred"", 39 per cent were in favour and 47 per cent against. Lib Dem voters were keenest, with 59 per cent in favour of accepting refugees and 27 per cent opposed. Most Conservative voters (54 per cent) were opposed, with Labour voters evenly split. UKIP voters were the most hostile to the idea, with 71 per cent opposed to it, despite Nigel Farage's initial support for taking Syrian refugees. At Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron said he would look at accepting some of the refugees facing the most difficult circumstances. ""I don't believe you can solve a refugee crisis of this scale when you have got almost half of the nine million population of Syria either displaced or at risk of displacement with a quota system where countries are taking a few hundred refugees,"" he said. ""But I do agree if there are very difficult cases of people who don't belong in refugee camps who have either been disabled by these attacks, or in very difficult circumstances, I'm happy for us to look at that argument. Britain always plays the right role in these desperate humanitarian crises."" Labour is calling for Britain to accept between 100 and 500 refugees made up of the most vulnerable people in the Syrian camps, including orphans, rape victims and those who had been tortured by Assad's forces.

Other likely concessions include a ten-day delay before any new order takes effect; no suggestion of preferential treatment for Christians from the six remaining Muslim-majority countries; and no indefinite ban on Syrian refugees entering the US.

This fiction has been convenient. Nations in the region could say to their people that the refugees were a temporary issue. Western countries could content themselves that at worst the war was someone else's problem and at best traditional aid, from tents to health care, would do the trick. As the exodus of refugees shakes the foundations of the EU, and as peace talks dramatise how far the parties are from a solution, that fiction must end. The good news about today's donor conference is that the conveners recognise the need to move the humanitarian response on to a new footing. The situation facing 13.5million inside Syria is worse than dire. The number starving in besieged areas - 400,000 people - has increased by two thirds in two years. We have to be able to get aid to them, and this could be an early win for the peace talks. But for the wider region the issue is not just more aid. We need better aid. Better aid means a recognition that Syrian refugees represent a long-term challenge, not a short-term annoyance. The response requires major economic intervention. In Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, a variety of legal and administrative hurdles prevent integration of Syrian refugees. The reason is obvious: their people are as leery as western countries about the cost of hosting millions of refugees. That is why we need to enshrine a grand bargain between Syria's neighbours and the international community: you give Syrian refugees economic and educational opportunity and we will offer financing and trade preference of a major and sustained kind. That means a million work permits for Syrians across the region. It means lifting the limits on the World Bank's ability to operate in Lebanon and Jordan - classified as middle-income countries. These nations need a ten-year package of support to develop the infrastructure to cope. With 200,000 Syrian children in Lebanon receiving no education, we need a transformation in funding to support quality community-based education as well as the state system.

Michael Russell, who served as Alex Salmond's education secretary, has claimed that opening Scotland's doors to displaced immigrants could help to solve the country's economic problems. The MSP for Argyll and Bute told Al Jazeera, the Arabic news network: ""There's room for them in Scotland and we want to give them refuge."" Nicola Sturgeon has stated that Scotland is willing to accept 1,000 refugees as a starting point. However, Mr Russell claimed that Scotland should mirror the open-door policy adopted by Germany, which has taken in hundreds of thousands of Syrians. He told the Qatar-based network: ""There are parts of Scotland where it would be immensely helpful to have refugees. Germany has a welldeveloped and flourishing economy. ""We have economic problems caused by depopulation in the west of Scotland. Here is a heaven-sent opportunity to do something sensible and do something helpful."" He added: ""We are not full up, we are absolutely not full up. We have vast tracts of empty land and places where we need additional population."" Mr Russell claimed that there were moral as well as economic reasons for opening Scotland's borders. He said: ""There has been a strong feeling in Scotland that we should be doing more and a frustration that we can't. The UK government has been dragging its feet. ""Locations with ageing and declining populations need young, economically active, ambitious people. Refugees are often those things."" The former environment and culture minister added: ""I don't think it's any surprise that Angela Merkel is Time's Person of the Year: a conservative politician who has shown an extraordinary sense of leadership in saying 'We have an obligation to help and we are going to help'. ""It's little wonder that many refugees want to go to Germany."" Amer Masri, who fled to Scotland in 2011 after being tortured for criticising Syria's rulers, also called for Scotland to take more refugees from the Middle East. The University of Edinburgh graduate told Al Jazeera: ""Finishing the war is the first thing we ask for. ""But with no signal that it will end soon I would stress that more numbers must come to the UK, and Scotland in particular.""

More than half the refugees will be children from the Middle East and north Africa, including unaccompanied minors and those at risk of trafficking and forced marriage. The move is aimed at protecting children at risk of exploitation, forced marriage or other abuse. Some will be accompanied by their families or carers as part of the scheme, in which a total of 3,000 people will arrive by 2020. The scheme, which is being guided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), goes beyond focusing on unaccompanied child asylum seekers to include help to resettle those defined as ""at risk"". The initiative is in addition to Britain's commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme. The scheme has already resettled more than 1,000 Syrian refugees, over half of them children, and is on course to resettle several thousand Syrian children over the next four years. James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, said: ""We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK."" Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, UNHCR representative to Britain, said: ""We welcome the scheme's focus on children at risk, including unaccompanied children, and the UK's commitment to upholding the principles of child protection in implementing the programme."" The announcement was welcomed by Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, who said the youngsters would get the ""vital protection and support they need"" in the UK. Yvette Cooper, the chairwoman of Labour's refugee task force, said the announcement included nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who were at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, suggested that the move was a cynical ploy to buy off Tory backbenchers before a Commons vote next week on lone children in the camps. Lord Dubs, who has led calls for the relocation of 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children from Europe, said: ""While I welcome this proposal, I will continue to press the government for more action when the Immigration Bill comes back to the floor of the Lords next week. You also have to wonder whether the use of the '3,000' figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate."" His amendment would allow 3,000 lone child refugees to enter Britain. Latest figures show 4,029 unaccompanied child asylum seekers are in Britain, including 870 who are being looked after by the Kent authorities and 433 in the London borough of Croydon. A scheme to disperse child asylum seekers around the country is to be introduced after the May local government elections.",1

The prime minister was on a visit to UK-funded refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan. He toured camps within a mile of the Syrian border to highlight the £1 billion that Britain has given to help more than four million Syrians displaced into Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. With Britain facing criticism for refusing to grant asylum to more Syrian refugees, he said that the country's focus on providing aid to the Middle East directly was helping to limit the numbers travelling to Europe: ""Around 3 per cent of the 11 million Syrians forced from their homes have sought asylum in Europe,"" he said. ""Without British aid, hundreds of thousands more could be risking their lives seeking to get to Europe."" Tammam Salam, the Lebanese prime minister, warned that without an end to the war, which has killed 240,000 people and displaced nearly half the population, the crisis would go on. ""We are convinced that the refugee crisis ... is a phenomenon that cannot come to a halt unless we find a political solution to put an end to the war in Syria,"" Mr Salam said. Aid agencies, including Save the Children, echoed that call. ""Important as it is, aid spending is not the full picture. If we are really going to solve the refugee crisis and give Syrian children the chance of a decent future, we need to end the war,"" it said. Britain has promised to take 20,000 refugees directly from camps in the region over five years. David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, said that Britain's commitment was equivalent to the number arriving every day on the beaches of Lesbos. The international aid effort to Syria is facing shortfalls. The $2.1 billion Lebanon crisis response plan appeal set up by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in December has received only $371 million from the international community, 17 per cent of the total it requires. Since the start of the year the cash-strapped UN World Food Programme has gradually cut food aid to about a third of Syrian refugees. EU borders back, pages 30-31 'We must get out to find our future' Case study The lack of a future is the biggest problem, according to Raed, a teacher at a refugee camp in Lebanon. Syrians feared decades of displacement like the Palestinians, he said. ""You think of yourself after five or ten years, where will I be? But here after one day I don't know what will happen. Now all we are doing is finding a Job, finding rent, bringing food. There is no ambition. We are Just staying alive. That is what is pushing people towards Europe - a place where they can guarantee a future."" Waleed, 28, a Syrian refugee in Jordan, has a business degree and works illegally six days a week in a supermarket in Amman earning 250 Jordanian dinars (£230) a month.

Most of the attacks occur on the Turkish mainland, where migrants await smugglers who will sneak them across the narrow strait separating the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey. Witnesses, however, have also reported attacks at sea as armed robbers take to the water to plunder the savings and valuables with which Syrian refugees are seeking to start a new life in Europe. ""They know that the Syrians are loaded with money and jewellery,"" Daniel Esdras, of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said. ""They are easy targets. Authorities on both side of the Aegean have to act before this gets ever more violent."" Late on Wednesday IOM crews rescued the latest victims of such an assault from a raft washed up on Lesbos. Three women and one man, all Syrian, were taken to hospital with serious head and chest injuries sustained when they were set upon by armed robbers looking for cash and jewellry. The three women, also accompanied by five children, were each carrying (EURO)10,000, which the robbers seized in addition to their gold necklaces.

Ms Cooper, the Labour leadership candidate, said she and Ed Balls, her husband, would ""of course"" shelter refugees if ""that's what was needed"". Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn, her rivals, are both said to have made similar offers. Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader, said she would put up a refugee even though she lived in a one-bedroom flat, but added: ""I would be happy to provide them with the living-room floor."" Ms Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, told Sky News: ""I've been overwhelmed myself with messages from people across Scotland saying they personally would be happy to give a home temporarily, or for a longer period of time, to somebody fleeing Syria. Yes, I would be absolutely happy to do that as part of a bigger, wider, organised approach."" Yesterday, the Pope urged each parish in Europe to take in at least one family and said that the Vatican would house two refugee families. However, councils and charities said that people might not have thought through the consequences of such a commitment. David Simmonds, the chairman of the asylum and refugee task group at the Local Government Association, dismissed an offer to house refugees from Bob Geldof last Friday as ""a bit pie in the sky"". He added: ""If Bob Geldof is willing to make that offer I'm sure his local council, which will already have a lot of people on its housing waiting list, will be very happy to bring them around this afternoon."" Mr Simmonds praised the generosity of the British public but questioned why they had not offered accommodation in the past to the many asylum seekers already in the country. ""We have seen refugee families come to the UK for many, many years. There is a cultural challenge which comes with that. If you have accommodation available and you are willing to take people in then there are many refugees who could take advantage of that. The reality is people always come forward in a crisis. They have not historically shown a huge willingness to take people for long, long periods of time,"" he said. He said people needed to consider the impact on schools, surgeries and other public services. Councils receive extra funds from central government for the first 12 months a refugee is in the country, but must then bear the costs. Leaders of 13 local councils, incuding Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Newham in east London and Edinburgh, have promised to take 750 Syrian refugees, according to Citizens UK, a charity. More than 3,000 people have offered rooms for refugees and 160 properties to house people fleeing Syria. More than 4,000 have signed up to welcome, settle and support refugees in their areas in ""refugees welcome"" teams, Citizens UK said. Refugee Action, which runs resettlement schemes in northern England, highlighted the difficulties facing families offering rooms to Syrians. ""There are massive challenges about community hosting. The main one is about safeguarding the people. Then there are the likely medical needs and the fact the children will need to be found schools. Families will often need support, particularly with learning English,"" a spokeswoman said. ""That is not to say community hosting would not work but there is not a scheme in place at the moment. A first step would be to make sure a programme is designed that works in participation with local communities, charities and local government."" Refugee charities and the Local Government Association also stressed the importance of ensuring that refugees were integrated into the communities where they were housed to prevent tension. Mr Simmonds said that wherever the Syrian refugees were to be housed, it would be essential to reassure communities that they were ""not being used as a dumping ground"". fugees A fundraising appeal for child refugees started by Patrick Ness, the author, raised £450,000 in two days after it won support from David Nicholls, Philip Pullman and Marian Keyes, his fellow authors.

Fighting began on Friday when the Lebanese army tried to arrest the leader of a jihadist Syrian rebel group, Imad Ahmad Jomaa, raising tensions across the north of the country. Sixteen Lebanese soldiers have since been killed and 85 wounded, with 22 more missing and possibly being held as hostages. Dozens of jihadist fighters have been reported killed.

A French government spokesman said it was ""fully committed"" to the deal. In June the international community pledged to support Lebanon's military. The country is currently hosting more than a million Syrian refugees; a quarter of the total Lebanese population.

A deeply divided caretaker cabinet has since run the country in the absence of an elected president. The country's already limited services have struggled to absorb more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Demands for the rubbish to be collected have expanded as the protests have grown to encompass complaints about corruption.

Matteo Salvini, the head of the Northern League party, has forged an alliance with former hard-right allies of Silvio Berlusconi and the far-right party CasaPound, which celebrates the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini. Yesterday, Mr Salvini shrugged off his party's links to fascism by claiming that the European Union is worse than Italy's 1930s dictatorship. ""They are starving people in a way two decades of Italian fascism never did,"" he said. Mr Salvini, 41, a member of the European parliament, added: ""In Brussels there is a lot worse than Mussolini."" At a rally on Saturday people in the crowd cried ""Duce, Duce"" and gave stiff-armed fascist salutes while a banner featured a photo of Mussolini with the slogan: ""Salvini, I have been waiting for you."" Simone Di Stefano, Casa-Pound's vice-president, pledged allegiance to Mr Salvini and called for an ""Italians first"" policy in jobs and schools. The coalition is filling a political vacuum left by the decline of Mr Berlusconi, the former prime minister who succumbed to scandal. At 16 per cent support, the Northern League leads Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party (12 per cent) in the polls. Speeches at the rally focused on cutting taxes, leaving the euro and halting the flow of migrants fleeing war, oppression and poverty. After 170,000 arrived last year, 8,000 have set sail so far this year, up more than 70 per cent on the same period last year. ""Send them home, we cannot allow even one more to land,"" Mr Salvini said. He also said that he wanted to send in bulldozers to demolish Roma camps in Italy.

Two co-leaders of the People's Democratic Party (HDP) were held after police swooped on their homes in the early hours, while ten of their MPs were arrested in an escalation of Ankara's crackdown on the third largest party in parliament. Hours after the arrests a car bomb struck a police station in the Kurdishmajority city of Diyarbakir, killing at least nine people. The attack was blamed on the outlawed Kurdish militants the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which later vowed to ""intensify its struggle against Turkey"". Several of the detained politicians, including the co-leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yüksekdag, were jailed pending trial. The arrests threaten to further destabilise Turkey. The country is battling an ethnic Kurdish insurgency in the southeast, purging state institutions following July's aborted coup, and trying to deal with a military intervention in Syria, an influx of Syrian refugees, the threat of Isis attacks and a faltering economy. The clampdown will also damage Turkey's relations with the United States and the European Union, which are already strained. Washington said that it was ""deeply troubled"" by the move against the HDP, while Germany summoned the Turkish ambassador. The EU said that the arrests ""compromise parliamentary democracy in Turkey and exacerbate the already very tense situation in the southeast of the coun-try, for which there can only be a political solution"". Tensions between President Erdogan and the HDP have been mounting since the summer last year, when the success of the party helped to deprive the president's Justice and Development Party of a parliamentary majority for the first time since it came to power in 2002. Shortly afterwards the mainly Kurdish southeast region was plunged back into violence after the collapse of a two-year ceasefire with the PKK, which has been waging an on-off war against the Turkish state for more than 30 years. Since then, the region has experienced the worst violence since the 1990s, when the conflict was at its height. The Turkish government accuses the HDP of supporting and providing propaganda for the PKK, which is deemed a terrorist organisation by the US, Europe and Turkey. The HDP denies this. The party described the arrests as ""the end of democracy in Turkey"". It said of President Erdogan: ""As he could not prevent us from entering parliament, he now orders us into prison."" The pressure on the Kurdish opposition has intensified in the aftermath of the attempted coup in July in which 241 people died. The Turkish government claims a major purge of the state apparatus is necessary to cleanse it of wouldbe plotters. Opposition parties and Turkey's western allies say the crackdown is targeting all critical voices. Following the arrests Turkish authorities curtailed internet access, with users reporting that access to social media was restricted. Binali Yildirim, the prime minister of Turkey, said that such measures were necessary from ""time to time"" and would be lifted once the danger had passed.",0

Starting last night was the magnificently dotty idea of Trainspotting Live, a three-evening paean to the romance of Britain's trains. As long as there is BBC Four, there will always be an England. Of course, television can also help if you want another stark reminder about our unsettling times. Offering a smack in the face was Exodus: Our Journey to Europe, about the refugee crisis, also running over three evenings. Perhaps the last thing you feel like right now. Yet if racism really is on the rise (as last night's Dispatches found) and our nation's generosity of spirit lies in post-referendum tatters, this should probably be watched by everyone. Unique for being built almost entirely from footage shot on camera-phones by Syrian refugees, last night's programme afforded a view from the inside out, with no authorial voice. New perspectives emerged: what it's like to be a child on such an odyssey (11-year-old Isra'a seemed more excited than scared); how much migration to safety can cost (some refugees sell their houses for funds, which makes you The moment that froze you to the sofa was Hassan's footage from inside an inflatable dinghy as it started to sink, thrusting you right into the panic engulfing the passengers, small children and all. Later, it was revealed that Isra'a's father, Tarek, paid (EURO)12,000 to traffickers for eight adults and eight children to risk their lives by dinghy. If they had been allowed to take a ferry, it would have cost them (EURO)22 each. Far from being huddled masses, here were articulate, decent individuals. The whole thing was like a dignified retort to Nigel Farage's Breaking Point poster, with an intimacy absent from anything else seen on the crisis. Back to charming old BBC Four, though. The Rev Richard Coles's musing on the Rev Charles Kingsley's The Water Babies, in The Secret Life of Children's Books, was, in part, an explanation of how fiction can effect social change. Tom, the boy hero of the 1863 fable, may turn into a fish, but he also helped to end the practice of sending children up chimneys. A man who ""found liberation in the purity of the world"", Kingsley was as paradoxical as his book, perhaps why Coles - 1980s pop hedonist, now Radio 4 clergyman - is so fascinated by him. Coles succinctly conveyed the tale's magical and ""maddening"" aspects (mainly the anti-Irish bigotry), helped by some imaginative direction. The shots of aquatic creatures in jars created their own intriguing ambience. It also has to be the most abstruse book ever written for a four-year-old (Kingsley's son), hingeing on a Darwinian twist that if an ascent in the order of life is possible, a reverse movement is equally possible. It's unlikely that, say, Julia Donaldson's books will have such programmes made about them in 150 years; equally, it's hard to imagine many children today knowing what to make of Kingsley's ""hymn to the unknowable"". Sometimes a sense of enchantment is enough. james.jackson@thetimes.co.uk Graphic   Refugees climb a fence at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Calais",1

5006,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,2/1/2016,573 words,NA,Exodus; Europe's great migration crisis is Just beginning,Broadsheet,"""A torrent of misery, swollen by sin, seems to contradict the fullness of time brought by Christ,"" the Pope declared yesterday. His compassion for the million migrants who arrived in the European Union in 2015 reflects both the concern by faith leaders to help this suffering tide of humanity - the Archbishop of Canterbury has also called for ""hospitality and love"" to welcome ""the alien and stranger"" - as well as the sense that Europe is facing one of the greatest human tragedies for a generation. A million refugees is roughly four times the number who arrived in 2014. They do not represent an existential threat. But a million is just the start. As autumn has turned to winter numbers remain high, with some estimates suggesting that 4,000 people are still reaching Europe every day. With an ageing population, Europe needs migrants. What the continent cannot stand is an unfettered influx, driven by an exodus from North Africa and beyond. Europe's leaders, so far, have responded shambolically. In August, Angela Merkel's noble declaration that Germany would accept Syrian refugees was intended to relieve the burden on southern border nations. In practice, it may have boosted arrivals hugely and caused the burden to grow. Austria and Hungary were swift to complain about the vast traffic heading north. Like the concurrent financial crisis, the EU's migrant crisis has exposed long-suppressed tensions within Europe. Today it is less clear than ever how some eastern nations, with little history of multiculturalism and a longstanding flirtation with the far right, can be reconciled with the more liberal west; or how the poorer south can share common interests with the richer north. The Schengen agreement, designed to allow the free movement of labour, in practice permits the free movement of almost everybody. Early attempts at a supranational EU border force show a union ready to adapt to new circumstances. Yet the popular mandate for such change is in considerable doubt. Britain, although thankfully outside the Schengen area, still has a role to play, not least because migrants are still massing in Calais. David Cameron has declared that this country will accept only a small number of refugees, and all from existing camps on the fringes of Syria. Military intervention in the territories of the so-called Islamic State is an essential component of stemming the flow. The ultimate aim is to give millions who would otherwise flee to Europe the chance to build a stable life at home. Yet the migrant problem is greater than Syria alone. It is not uniquely the poor and desperate who head for Europe. Those seeking to build better lives abroad are often the brightest and most skilled. The prospects of their home nations diminish when they go. The coming year will be one of hard choices. Factors which both draw migrants to Europe and push them from home must be addressed. Middle Eastern nations must accept greater responsibility for their neighbours. In continental Europe, it may well be that Schengen cannot survive. All nations have responsibilities towards refugees, yet Europe must control its borders and police its seas, and return migrants home when it can. Most of all, this must all be done in a way that is co-ordinated between EU member states and honest about the challenge. Dealing with migrants is the greatest challenge of Europe's future and the search for solutions grows more urgent by the day.",1

In recent days the billionaire said that he would be a more popular president among African-Americans than Barack Obama, claimed that his supporters would stick by him if he went on a shooting rampage and retweeted a message apparently from a neo-Nazi. It seems that shock tactics work. Nationally Mr Trump is 30 points ahead of Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, according to the latest Ipsos/Reuters survey. In Iowa he has a five-point lead over Mr Cruz, based on an average of recent polls by the Real Clear Politics website. His refusal to leave the limelight or surrender his lead is forcing all sides to confront what seemed unthinkable months ago: that a thrice-married reality TV host could be the Republican candidate for the White House. Allies of Hillary Clinton have begun to dig into Mr Trump's past, looking for fodder for future attacks. The effort is being headed by David Brock, a veteran Washington operative who is running a pro-Clinton group that has become her most fierce attack dog. ""I now believe the GOP nominee is likely to be Donald Trump,"" Mr Brock told CNN. ""I don't agree with some thinking [on the Democrat side] that Trump would be easy to beat,"" he added. ""He's rewritten all the rules and I would expect a tough race with Hillary."" David Axelrod, Mr Obama's former strategist, said yesterday that voters were hungry for change and he would not rule out the possibility of Mr Trump reaching the Oval Office. Mr Trump appears to believe that African-American voters will help him to get there. ""They are going to like me better than they like Obama,"" he told the Fox network. ""The truth is Obama has done nothing for them."" The tycoon is due in Iowa today for two events, one at a high school in Marshalltown and the other at the University of Iowa. He has shown new willingness recently to submit to the rigours of the campaign trail, staying in a motel instead of flying back to New York on his private jet. On Sunday he attended a church in Muscatine, Iowa, for a sermon on humility and the obligation to treat Syrian refugees and Mexican immigrants with kindness. ""I don't know if that was aimed at me,"" he said afterwards. ""Perhaps."" There is still time for Mr Trump's campaign to stumble. Establishment Republican voters, split at present between several of his rivals, could topple him by coalescing around one candidate. However, some Republican grandees have softened their tone when discussing him. Bob Dole, the former Kansas senator, said: ""If it comes down to Cruz and Trump, I'm a big Trump supporter."" Mr Dole, who was the Republican nominee in 1996, called Mr Cruz a ""conservative extremist"" and said that Mr Trump would be more open to making deals. ? President Obama suggested yesterday that he would prefer Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic nominee. Although he has said that he will not endorse a candidate Mr Obama pointed to Mrs Clinton's experience and said that Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is her closest rival, owed much of his popularity to being a novelty and a ""bright, shiny object"".",0

The BBC's underwhelming Chinese School finished last night, while Channel 4 will be Educating Cardiff this autumn. In the meantime, there was ITV's School Swap: the Class Divide, wearing heart on sleeve from the title on down. Three pupils from £27,000-a-year Warminster School, and the headmaster Mark Mortimer, were to spend a week at Bemrose School, a Derbyshire comprehensive. Next week its headmistress, Jo Ward, takes three of her charges in the other direction. The documentary brimmed with good intentions and genuine curiosity: a refreshing change from the adversarial Chinese School, even if flashpoints were so few that I wondered how much the children were being paid to behave so impeccably for the cameras. Still, there were intriguingly contradictory insights. Smaller class sizes, bigger budgets and a tiny turnover of pupils allowed Warminster to instil essential self-confidence and discipline, it was mooted. Which sounded eminently sensible, except that a Warminster pupil, Jon, predicted a C for GCSE maths, learnt far more from a class at Bemrose and was told he should aim for an A. What of discipline? On the surface, Bemrose boys messed around, but later Ward wondered whether the greater compliance of Warminster's pupils made private-school teachers lazier in their teaching methods. The constant churn of foreign pupils at Bemrose, many from war zones and unable to speak English, presented serious challenges - yet Nazh, the daughter of Syrian refugees, resolved to justify her parents' sacrifices. It was all very anecdotal, thoroughly unscientific and only told half the story. Yet this was still a touching, optimistic appraisal of state education as it faces unprecedented pressures. I await the return trip with interest. The producers of Terror on Everest: Surviving the Nepal Earthquake, meanwhile, Could Do Better. Even with the raw material, they couldn't resist slathering a hyperbolic voiceover and soundtrack on top. Does an earthquake that claimed more than 9,000 lives really need a ""deadly secret"", let alone an orchestral cue? Nevertheless, this was utterly compelling and, for those directly affected, visceral language felt entirely appropriate. Interviewed months later, many still looked haunted and shaken, having barely escaped with their lives. Curiosity turned to wonder, then to horror and panic as a wall of ice descended on Everest Base Camp: ""I was thinking: does it even matter if I run now?"" The devastation was such that no one knew who was missing or where they might be. In Kathmandu, centuries-old temples crumbled, while remote villages were obliterated. The footage was of a quality unthinkable even a decade ago when the Asian tsunami was represented by just a few brief, grainy clips. This time, smartphones captured every stage of the catastrophe with terrifying clarity. The science behind the quake was cogently explained, but offered only brief respite. By the end of the hour, my shoulders were aching from the tension and my conscience was pricked - this country still needs aid, desperately.

Most of the attacks occur on the Turkish mainland, where migrants await smugglers who will sneak them across the narrow strait separating the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey. Witnesses have also reported attacks at sea as armed robbers take to the water to plunder the savings and valuables with which Syrian refugees are seeking to start a new life in Europe. ""They know that the Syrians are loaded with money and jewellery,"" Daniel Esdras, of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said. ""They are easy targets. Authorities on both side of the Aegean have to act before this gets ever more violent."" Late on Wednesday, IOM crews rescued the latest victims of such an assault from a raft washed up on Lesbos. Three women and a man, all Syrian, were taken to hospital with serious head and chest injuries sustained when they were set upon by armed robbers. The three women, accompanied by five children, were each carrying (EURO)10,000, which the robbers seized in addition to their gold necklaces. ""Two of the women were hit on their jaws with the butt of a gun. Their necks were also deeply scarred from the vicious tugging assailants took to snatch their gold necklaces,"" said Zoi Lovaditou, the IOM officer in Lesbos. ""A third woman was bleeding from the chest. She had been clobbered by a crowbar because she refused to hand over money she was keeping in her bra."" There have been at least 20 assaults on refugees since July. One high-seas attack reported to the IOM was carried out by a group of hooded men carrying M-16 automatic rifles. Witnesses said the men tore refugees' clothes and underwear from them at gunpoint in the search for hidden cash. Greek authorities fear the robberies are a new spin-off industry for people smugglers who no longer join migrants on their sea journey for fear of being caught by law enforcement patrols. It comes as dramatic photographs showed migrants swimming for their lives off the coast of Libya after the fishing boat that was carrying them capsized on Wednesday. There are believed to have been as many as 700 people on board. It called for help because it was taking on water, and overturned when the passengers all moved to one side upon seeing the first rescue boats, the Irish navy patrol boat LE Niamh, and Dignity I, operated by Doctors Without Borders. Juan Matías, rescue coordinator aboard Dignity I, said: ""It was a horrible sight: people clinging desperately to lifebelts, to boats, to whatever they could find to stay alive, among people who were drowning or who were already dead."" Some of the migrants had lifejackets they had bought for £15-30 after paying between £750 and £1,150 for passage on the boat. A total of 26 bodies have been recovered so far, but more than 200 people who were aboard the ship are believed to have died. Five men have been arrested on suspicion of multiple counts of manslaughter and aiding illegal immigration, and of belonging to a criminal organisation based in Libya.

5029,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,20/9/2014,549 words,NA,Confronting Unholy Warriors; Arab states have to Join the fight against Islamic State. Jordan is showing the way,Broadsheet,"On a recent tour of the Middle East, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, found only one Arab country willing to contribute troops to the coalition against Islamic State (Isis) jihadists. That volunteer was Jordan. The Hashemite kingdom, already strained by the presence of more than 600,000 Syrian refugees, appears ready to supply troops and to pool intelligence. It is pressing for urgent action and is already playing a critical role in persuading Sunni tribal leaders from Iraq to stand up against the rampaging army of the Islamic State. Jordan's resolve demands respect and puts the rest of the Sunni Arab world to shame. Tangled up in sectarian politics and regional rivalries, these states, unlike Jordan, are proving to be grudging allies in a looming war that should be of huge importance to them. Saudi Arabia has a large, modern air force, equipped by the United States and Britain, yet its modus operandi in this crisis has been to urge others to act and to deplore American indecisiveness. Its half-hearted contribution to the coalition is an offer to host a training camp for moderate Syrian rebels. The Gulf states are lukewarm. Egypt, whose army is still subsidised by the Pentagon, is reluctant to be drawn into the conflict. As for Turkey, a Nato partner, its ambiguous assistance amounts to allowing Isis recruits to cross its border into Syria and then take in Syrian Kurdish refugees fleeing the very same jihadists. Britain should join America in using the United Nations general assembly next week to lobby for a coalition with backbone and spirit. Some 40 states have signed up to the idea of a common front against Isis yet so far only the US, with some support from France, has actually struck against the jihadist positions in Iraq. It is becoming increasingly clear to western commanders that the aim of eradicating Isis cannot be achieved only by air strikes. Like the rocketbatteries of Hamas, Isis units will thread their way inside civilian communities. Only when the jihadists are confronted face to face will they grasp the hopelessness of their war. President Obama did not strengthen his appeal for Arab solidarity by promising Americans that he was not going to fight another ground war in Iraq. That was intended to reassure congressional sceptics, yet it was a pledge that will have to be broken. There are already hundreds of military advisers on Iraqi terrain and this force is going to have to www.swell.No one is suggesting a surge of hundreds of thousands in the manner of the big wars of the last decade. The military investment, however, should be sufficient to complete the mission of destroying the terror franchise of Isis. The risks inherent in the approaching war are not so much of losing soldiers on the battlefield as in starting a job and leaving it unfinished. This would be a sure way of enhancing the spurious authority of Islamic State. Arab states must step up to the mark. The Free Syrian Army must be reinforced so it can challenge Isis and end the scandalous siege of Aleppo. The Iraqi Kurds have to be turned into an offensive force. Turkey has to be persuaded not to sabotage a stronger, resurgent Kurdistan. Above all, this coalition has to be led from the front by Arab states, backed up by the United States and its western allies.",0
5030,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,3/10/2014,552 words,NA,Turkey Joins the Fray; Ankara's engagement may be a tipping point in the war against Islamic State,Broadsheet,"Turkey edged closer yesterday to military involvement in the war against Islamic State, formerly known as Isis. The move was overdue. With the jihadis poised to overrun the town of Kobani on the Syrian-Turkish border, the fighting has reached Turkey's doorstep. It was high time for Ankara to abandon its uncomfortable position of entrenched ambiguity towards Isis. If Turkey now engages fully in the campaign, the tide can turn quickly in Syria. Before parliament convened in Ankara to pass a motion authorising military deployment, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made plain that Turkey was no longer Nato's most reluctant ally. ""The arrow has left the bow,"" he said. President Erdogan's aims in the conflict are threefold: to establish a safe zone inside Syria along the Turkish border, to establish a no-fly zone over Syria and to train up the Syrian opposition to speed the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime. These goals are controversial inside and outside Turkey. Kurds believe the buffer zone would be designed chiefly to prevent the Kurds of Turkey, Syria and Iraq joining to form a greater Kurdistan. Deputies in parliament yesterday argued that any use of Turkish ground troops in Syria, without Nato or United Nations backing, would jeopardise Ankara's ambitions to be a regional power. The United States, meanwhile, is sceptical about setting up a no-fly zone that would be a direct challenge to the Assad regime and deflect from the fight against Isis. The fear in the Pentagon is that a dogfight between a Turkish and a Syrian plane would draw Nato into full-scale combat with Assad. Nonetheless President Erdogan's strategy is rational, compatible with the coalition's broader mission and has been well argued. Turkey shares a 1,200-kilometre border with Iraq and Syria and has the right to think in terms of pre-empting an attack on its territory. It has taken in 1.5 million Syrian refugees, more than any other country. In the past ten days 150,000 have sought shelter, either inside Turkey or hugging its frontier. Turkey has a right to defend itself even if that means moving troops forward into the increasingly lawless terrain of northern Syria. As for the banning of military flights over Syria, that would require United Nations approval. It should however remain an option if the Assad regime tries in the future to impede the coalition's campaign against Isis. More important, however, is that Turkey stays focused on the war against Islamic State. That means allowing Nato aircraft to use its bases, including Incirlik, as launchpads and refuelling centres for the campaign. It means deploying Turkish troops only against the jihadis and not, at this stage, the Syrian army. And it means a real clarity of purpose: the end of all covert financing of Islamic State, a crackdown on extremist recruiting and the transit of western jihadis to Syria, and a stop to the cross-border trade in fuel. Many Turkish opposition deputies made plain in yesterday's parliamentary debate that they would prefer the country to stay out of the fray. They are wrong. President Erdogan has recognised that this cannot be an option for a country so directly affected by the turmoil on its borders. Turkey, embedded in Nato and committed to this war, can legitimately claim to be a regional power with real clout.",0
5059,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,2/12/2015,543 words,NA,School for refugee children that keeps the Syrian dreams alive,Broadsheet,"Christmas Appeal Lucy Bannerman near Dohuk, northern Iraq News of the deaths of Mania, Nalin and Habat - three siblings aged nine, four and nine months - spread quickly around the camp. The children drowned in the Mediterranean on a desperate flight to Greece. Mahmoud, a teacher in one of the camp schools, shows me their smiling pictures on his mobile phone. Their father was a lifeguard but his skill and experience could not prevent the tragedy that unfolded. ""There were ten children on the sinking boat,"" Mahmoud said. ""He managed to save the others. But he couldn't save his own three children."" Mahmoud is part of a programme run by the British charity War Child that works in these camps in northern Iraq, getting children into school. He often has to step in to take classes when another teacher joins the exodus to Europe. This summer, they lost 11 of the 46 teachers. Mahmoud is used to seeing students disappear too, often wondering who has made it and who has not, but the death of the three siblings was the worst case anyone remembers. Those who leave the camp typically take the road north, past a huge mural of Aylan Kurdi, the boy who will be forever remembered dead in the arms of a policeman. It looms from the roadside like a bad omen. Then it's over the border into Turkey and the smuggler routes across the sea. This year, Mahmoud's brother abandoned his post as assistant principal at one of the other camp schools. He survived another shipwreck to make it to Germany. Mahmoud, however, is determined to stay. The handsome Manchester United fan from Damascus hopes that by recruiting children on to the War Child education courses he can kickstart the stalled schooling of refugee children. ""We tell their parents, 'Don't take your children',"" he said. ""It's better to stay here. Let us teach them skills to develop their own country when war is over, instead of [them] benefiting someone else's. We try to create an entertaining environment, to encourage them to go to school."" We take a walk around the camp, where Mahmoud, 25, has been living for the past three years, since war interrupted his studies at the University of Damascus. It buzzes with industriousness, with women digging ditches and watering flowerbeds that rise out of the rubble, and men fixing washing machines, hammering roofs and bubbling on shisha pipes. Children roll barrels down broad avenues separating the tent houses. Whenever he is tempted by the lure of Europe, he reminds himself of the good times - the day the War Child team led a procession through the camp, gathering children to celebrate the start of term. Or the time, 30 of them criss-crossed every acre of the camp, enrolling children for school. ""People were so happy to see us,"" he said. ""Everyone was offering us tea. They were so happy we were asking about their www.children.No one had ever cared to ask before."" The equity brokerage firm Aviate Global is kickstarting donations for War Child with a gift of £100,000 from its annual charity trading day on November 24.

The medium-range ballistic missile, fired from the country's central area, flew about 300 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan, heightening fears that the Pyongyang regime is getting ever closer to being able to strike the US with nuclear weapons. Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president, pledged a tough response. ""We are going to reinforce and strengthen our vital alliances in the Pacific region as part of our strategy to deter and prevent the increasing hostility that we've seen in recent years from the North Korean regime,"" he told Fox News. The missile test was the second by a hostile regime since Mr Trump came to power: Iran carried out a similar launch last month, triggering new sanctions from the White House. North Korea confirmed that a Pukguksong-2 ballistic missile had been test-fired successfully. According to the official media, Kim Jong-un, its leader, ""expressed great satisfaction over the possession of another powerful nuclear attack means which adds to the tremendous might of the country"". The launch was condemned by Nato, Russia and Japan. The Obama administration is believed to have advised the incoming White House team that North Korea, with its expanding nuclear capability, should become the top national security priority. During the election campaign Mr Trump told supporters that Mr Kim was a ""maniac"" and said ""we can't play games with him"". When Mr Kim boasted last month that North Korea was in the ""final stages"" of developing an inter-continental ballistic missile, Mr Trump tweeted in response: ""It won't happen!"" Mr Trump spent the weekend hosting Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and his wife, Akie, at Mar-a-Lago, his luxury Florida golf resort, where the two world leaders made time to play a round on Saturday. After the missile test the two men convened a brief late-night press conference at which Mr Abe rebuked the Pyongyang regime, saying that the test ""can absolutely not be tolerated"". Mr Trump added that ""the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 per cent."" Richard Haass, a veteran diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that unless Mr Trump could enlist China's help in squeezing North Korea through sanctions, he would face a ""truly fateful decision"": either the US was prepared to let North Korea attain the capability to menace its mainland ""or we are going to use military force one way or another to destroy their nuclear missile capability"". After three weeks dominated by the president's efforts to push through an immigration ban, diplomacy will jostle for equal billing with border security this week as he concludes his first month in the White House with visits from the leaders of two of America's closest allies, Canada and Israel. Mr Trump will meet Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, in Washington today. It will be a study in contrasts: Mr Trudeau is 25 years younger than Mr Trump and a progressive admired by liberals around the world who champions free trade and has opened his country's borders to thousands of Syrian refugees. Their meeting could set the tone for relations between the countries for years to come. Mr Trump's refugee and immigration ban may come up in the talks. The Canadian leader responded to the travel ban by tweeting that Canada welcomed people fleeing persecution, terrorism and war, arguing that ""diversity is our strength"". Federal judges confirmed the suspension of Mr Trump's travel ban last Thursday, but the White House is expected to issue a new executive order this week reinstating some of its provisions. On Wednesday Mr Trump will receive Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. Mr Netanyahu was among the sharpest critics of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers.

David Cameron said that Michael Gove, the friend whom he asked to be godfather to his first son, had ""lost it"" for comparing economists warning about the fallout from Brexit to Nazis smearing Albert Einstein in the 1930s. The justice secretary apologised for what he said was a ""clumsy and inappropriate"" jibe but insisted that he had not intended to insult the group of Nobel prize-winning economists. ""Throughout the campaign I've avoided making personal attacks. I'm sorry for speaking so clumsily and apologise for giving offence,"" he said. There was no such restraint from Sir John Major, however, who stepped up his attacks on Mr Gove and Boris Johnson, accusing them of being ""the gravediggers of our prosperity"" who would have to account for their ""lies"" if they resulted in Britain coming out of the EU. He said: ""They will have to account for what they have said and done but that will be of no consolation."" He added that Britain's influence in the world would be diminished and predicted that the nation would become ""shrunk down to a little England, perhaps without Scotland, perhaps with a grumpy Wales and certainly with a Northern Ireland divided from the south"". The recriminations flew in the opposite direction with Andrea Leadsom, the Brexit-supporting energy minister, hitting back at Ruth Davidson, her fellow Tory, who accused her of lying about the volume of UK rules made in Brussels during Tuesday night's TV debate. Ms Leadsom said she was ""very disappointed"" that her Tory colleague had ""called me a liar"", adding: ""It's not what I would have done."" There was criticism for Lord Sugar, the Remain-supporting entrepreneur and star of the BBC One show The Apprentice, after he said that the Labour MP Gisela Stuart should not ""tell us British what we should do"" because she is originally from Germany. Ms Stuart, who is from Bavaria and moved to Britain in 1974, was representing the Leave campaign with Mr Johnson and Ms Leadsom in a BBC debate at Wembley Arena. ""I find it strange that Gisela Gschaider, a 1974 immigrant from Germany, is on the Brexit panel telling us British what we should do,"" Lord Sugar said. Nadhim Zahawi, the Tory MP and Leave backer, said: ""You must withdraw and apologise to Gisela. That is disgraceful. She is as British as you are."" The peer denied that he was being racist, pointing out that Ms Stuart is an immigrant who is now arguing against immigration. Despite the bitterness of the campaigns Mr Cameron made ""together"" the watchword of his effort to persuade people to vote Remain at his final rally. The prime minister travelled from the southwest in the morning to Birmingham to appear with the Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Mr Cameron said the key word at the heart of the EU debate was ""together"" as he stressed his passion and patriotism. He focused on the Midlands as it is seen as a key battleground region with many voters still undecided. Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, led a rally in London flanked by Kezia Dugdale, the Scottish Labour leader, and Carwyn Jones, the leader of Welsh Labour. Mr Johnson started the day at Billingsgate fish market in London before embarking on a seven-stop helicopter tour that included Maldon and Southend in Essex, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, Wolverhampton, Selby, North Yorkshire, and Darlington, Co Durham. Nigel Farage appeared in Westminster for a Ukip event, at which he refused to apologise for a controversial anti-migrant poster that critics compared to Nazi propaganda. The Ukip leader denied claims by one of his MEPs that he had said sorry for the advertisement and declared: ""I can't apologise for the truth."" The poster featured a line of Syrian refugees with the caption: ""Breaking point. The EU has failed us all."" Mr Farage unveiled it last Thursday hours before the murder of the MP Jo Cox. The poster has come under intense criticism from both camps. Mr Gove said that he ""shuddered"" when he saw it, while Mr Johnson said he was ""profoundly unhappy"" with it. George Osborne said it had echoes of 1930s Nazi propaganda and branded it ""disgusting"". Dave Prentis, the Unison boss, said he had reported the ""vile, racist"" poster to the police. Mr Farage pulled out of the final live television event of the campaign last night hosted by Jeremy Paxman. The Ukip leader's team blamed ""family reasons"" for his decision to pull out of the Channel 4 debate. Graphic   Boris Johnson visited Billingsgate fish marketPETER MACDIARMID/LNP",0

(Rhys Blakely writes) Donald Trump has changed parties five times and would be the first commander-inchief with no experience in office or at the top of the military. On foreign policy he says that he is his own best adviser: ""I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things."" His campaign, however, has been underpinned by three principles: that American military might is taken for granted by its freeloading allies; that the US has signed trade deals that harm its middle class; and that immigrants are bringing crime and taking jobs. Mr Trump has campaigned as the ultimate political outsider. ""I'm not running to be everyone's favourite president,"" he said in May. ""Things are seriously wrong in this country. People are hurting. I'm running to move quickly to make big changes."" day one If he wins, Mr Trump will be inaugurated on Friday, January 20. He will ride with President Obama in the presidential limousine to the US Capitol. He will then return to the Oval Office for what has been termed the ""First Day Project"" - a session where he would spend hours signing documents ""to erase the Obama presidency"". Mr Trump could withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and suspend a scheme that brings Syrian refugees to the US. He could task officials with drafting trade cases against China - potentially opening a trade war. In the evening, Mr Trump has said he would go to a ""terrific"" inauguration ball. the first 100 days Mr Trump has said that the priority for his first 100 days would be ""draining the Washington swamp"". He would restrict White House officials from becoming corporate lobbyists after they leave office; introduce term limits for members of Congress and cancel all payments to the UN climate change programme. He would begin interviewing candidates for a vacancy on the Supreme Court, a decision that could shape issues such as abortion and gun control for the next 30 years. He has said that he would give key jobs to military generals, business executives and possibly family members. Many of his most important appointments will have to be approved by Congress, where he may well face resistance. Questions would loom over the Trump Organisation, his business. Presidents are not bound by the conflict-of-interest rules that restrict White House staff. He has said that his children would run it. By the end of his first 100 days, he told The New York Times that ""the wall with Mexico would be designed, an immigration ban on certain countries would be in place, an audit of the Federal Reserve would be under way and plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be in motion"". beyond the first 100 days the wall: Top aides say that Mr Trump will need to press ahead with his plan to build a 1,000-mile wall along the southern border to maintain his credibility. He has said that it will be paid for by Mexico. Most experts call that implausible. That may force Mr Trump to go to Congress to ask for the money, and face a rebuff. A token elongation of the current border barrier seems likely. taxes: Mr Trump has proposed deep tax cuts. To pass them he needs the backing of the legislature but Republicans are unlikely to have the 60 seats they would need in the Senate to override filibusters. going alone: He could order a ban on Muslims entering the country - a proposal he made last December - without Congressional approval. This would likely be contested in court. syria: Mr Trump has declined to detail his plan to defeat Isis, saying he wants to keep it secret to confuse the enemy. He has, however, said he would ""bomb the shit"" out of the jihadist group's oil dealings. He has hinted at deploying 30,000 troops to the Middle East and suggested that he would give Russia more space to exert its influence. nato: He has said that he might not come to the aid of Nato allies, threatening to undermine a key tenet of the treaty. trade: President Trump would have the authority to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organisation. He could impose tariffs on Chinese goods, although one analysis said the resultant trade war would put four million Americans out of work. obamacare: This week Mr Trump said he would call a special session of Congress to repeal Obamacare. However, a move to repeal the healthcare law through Congress won't be quick or easy. immigration: He has sent out conflicting signals on the fate of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. After saying that they would all be removed by force, he has since ""softened"" his position, declaring that only the worst criminals would be immediately removed, with the fate of the rest decided when the border was secure.",0

Four months after arriving at Berlin airport, unable to speak a word of German, Fadi Salem and his younger brother Feras are being taught how to find their way around. The two brothers from Aleppo will not only receive hundreds of hours of free language training but also an orientation course on how to live in Germany, with lessons about the politics, economics, history, education system and religious traditions of the country they have chosen for their new home. Germany agreed to take 20,000 Syrian refugees through a UN programme. Half have arrived so far . This is on top of the 55,000 Syrians who have made it under their own steam since January 2011, often after handing thousands of euros to people traffickers. The pace shows no sign of slacking - latest figures show that 4,910 Syrians turned up in December alone, making them the largest national group seeking refuge in Germany. For the chosen ones, known as the ""quota refugees"" plucked from the camps on Syria's borders, the German government rolls out a red carpet that offers a new life, funding for accommodation, generous welfare hand-outs and help finding a job. German unemployment is the second lowest in the EU and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, often speaks of the need for new arrivals to help the www.economy.No wonder so many of Fadi Salem's friends in Aleppo are also dreaming of settling in the country. ""As soon as I arrived in Germany I was made to feel welcome,"" said Mr Salem, 38, a former Arabic teacher with a master's degree. ""In Germany we can find respect, we can find work, we can find a good life for the future. I am not a criminal, I am not a terrorist, I am a Syrian. ""In places like Sweden you sit around for a long time without work or study, only sleeping, eating and playing on the internet. In this country they need you for the future, you can study and then work. Ms Merkel says that asylum is important for building Germany. In Lebanon, people say, the Syrians drink our water. This country helps us in many ways."" Language lessons are offered immediately to the quota refugees, who get a two-year visa, and to the other Syrians once they have been granted asylum. In the case of Syrians, around 90 per cent are being allowed to stay because of the dire situation in their country. ""They have a real desire to learn,"" said Martin Hahn, head of the Institute for Intercultural Communication (IIK), where Mr Salem is studying. Unlike many other centres, the IIK puts on German classes for Syrian asylum-seekers while they are still waiting to hear if they have been granted refuge. For the quota refugees and those accepted for asylum, the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees pays for 600 hours of language lessons over six months, and 60 hours of orientation lessons. If their German is not good enough after 600 hours, another 300 hours is provided. All the while, they have accommodation and subsidised food, and afterwards, their rent will be paid while they look for work. ""The ultimate goal is to get them ready for further education or for employment,"" said Dr Hahn. These refugees are treated as if they will settle permanently. German taxpayers spent (EURO)244 million on integration courses for refugees last year, with forecasts of an increase this year. Quota refugees and those granted asylum are dispersed around Germany's 16 states according to a mathematical formula, based on the existing population. The highest proportion are sent to North-Rhine Westphalia (21.2 per cent) followed by Bavaria (15.3 per cent), while tiny Saarland takes 1.2 per cent. The rise in migrants fuelled by the Syrian exodus and Germany's generous UN reception programme has triggered a backlash, however, especially in eastern states not used to foreign faces. In Saxony, which has to take 5.1 per cent of the dispersed migrants, the new anti-Islamisation movement Pegida (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West) sprang up in Dresden with weekly demonstrations attracting thousands of supporters. It has shown politicians in Berlin that there are real fears among some Germans about the rise in immigration, with asylum applications reaching 202,830 last year, the highest since 2004. Back in the IIK classroom in Berlin with the Syrian students, the toughest challenge is German spelling and grammar. ""They are a bit shocked when they find out that German has three articles,"" said Lilli Herschorn, the teacher. ""You can see when they first arrive they are depressed. After coming here, they cheer up a bit. They forget their troubles for a while because learning language is an absorbing experience.""

5216,src_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,7/2/2015,971 words,Adam Sage,How a small French town lost its sons to holy war in Syria,Broadsheet,"The small town of Lunel, in southern France, used to be known for its bullfighting festivals and sweet white wines. Now it is notorious as a recruitment centre for jihadists. Out of a population of 27,500, at least 17 men have left since 2013 to fight for either al-Qaeda or Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Three took their wives or girlfriends with them, one of whom was pregnant and gave birth in the war zone. The number of Lunellois killed in action marks out this otherwise nondescript French town: six have died, which represents about 10 per cent of the total number of French jihadist deaths in the conflict. Last month, police arrested five local men on suspicion of encouraging Muslims to join the jihad. Local dignitaries used to a slower pace of life are struggling to comprehend how their small town has become the centre of French radicalisation. The uncomfortable reality for France is that a community of bored, jobless young Muslims living mainly in the drab, five-storey blocks on the Abrivados estate have been radicalised by extremist preachers under the noses of the authorities. It is another sombre warning to the country after the massacre last month at the magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. The town's jihadists attend Lunel's mosque, a modern building next to a fast-food restaurant on the town's outskirts that has been described by the government as a hotbed of fundamentalism and linked to Tablighi Jamaat, a hardline Islamist group. The mosque itself is split between radical followers and opponents of the imam, a Moroccan who preaches only in Arabic. ""I told him to his face that we couldn't understand a word he said, and that we wanted a French imam. He told us that, in that case, we should pray in a room outside the mosque,"" Karim Yahiaoui, 37, one of the worshippers, said. The mosque's hardliners joined Muslim charities supposedly committed to helping Syrian refugees, and also formed their own prayer group, meeting to discuss the plight of those suffering in the vicious civil war and encouraging each other to make the journey there. Many appear to have believed, quite genuinely, that they would undertake only humanitarian missions. ""But these groups operate like a sect,"" said Philippe Moissonnier, a councillor in the town. ""And sects manipulate people. Once you're out there, it's easy to get you to take up arms. They turn sheep into lions."" Once radicalised, the mosque's patrons returned to the Abrivados estate to draw other disaffected youngsters - all of whom they knew from school and youth groups - into their network. The estate is home to several of those who left for Syria, including two killed in a bombing last year. One of them, named as Karim, 28, made an especially rapid conversion to the path of jihad. ""He never seemed particularly religious when he was younger and used go out to nightclubs, like all the kids around here when they've got a bit of money,"" one neighbour said. ""He opened a café, but dropped everything a couple of years ago when he found religion. The next thing I heard he was in Turkey and was heading for Syria."" The estate is no Parisian banlieue, though it is equally deprived in its own way: it is based in the poor south side of town, where first, second and thirdgeneration immigrants, mainly from Algeria and Morocco, struggle to find work. About 40 per cent of those under 25 are jobless, and tune in to Arab television through satellite. Taher Akermi, a counsellor at a statefunded youth and cultural centre in Lunel, said he had known most of the six local men killed fighting alongside the jihadists in Syria, and was baffled by their choices. ""This has been my work for 25 years and I feel this as a failure,"" he said. ""What am I doing here?"" The message being spread by extremist Muslims in the town has not stopped at the deprived estates in the south, but, unusually, has extended beyond it. On the other side of the town, mainly white residents live in houses rather than apartment blocks, have comfortable jobs in nearby Montpellier and watch mainstream French television. It is here that Raphael Amar, of mixed Jewish-Catholic heritage, lived. Laurent Amar, his father, described a man far from radical Islam: he played in a rock band, enjoyed video games and wanted to become a computer programmer. But while studying computer science at Montpellier, he made friends with a Muslim from Lunel who told him that Islam had helped him to overcome the loss of his mother. ""What the man said touched him deeply and at the end of their first meeting, Raphael told us he cried,"" Mr Amar said. ""He quickly took the decision to convert to Islam."" Mr Amar said his son put down his guitar and started taking a Koran with him at all times, including to the beach in La Grande-Motte, a few miles from Lunel. In July last year, he vanished - phoning home a few days later to say that he was doing relief work in Syria. In October, Mr Amar was preparing to travel to Turkey to try to talk his son, then 22, into returning to Lunel when a woman rang at the door of the family home. She said she was a local Muslim and was bringing news of his son's death. She had photographs of his body, and of two other Lunellois killed on the same day. She said Mr Amar's son had been involved in humanitarian missions, until the Syrian army attacked Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria and he took up a gun for the first and last time. As with so much of the rest of France, what is happening in the mosques, social groups and estates of Lunel is a mystery to the wider community - but it is a puzzle that will have to be solved if the growing radicalisation afflicting the nation is to be solved. ""It's a mystery to us why so many young people have gone out there,"" Mr Moissonnier said. ""But I'm sure it's not about to stop. There'll be more departures yet."" Graphic   The quiet streets of Lunel have spawned a jihadist menace that has taken residents by surprise - and led many young men to take up arms in Syria, among them,right, two named only as Ahmed and Houssem. Above right: Taher Akermi, a youth counsellor, feels his life's work has been in vain and asks: ""What am I doing here?""",0
