25,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,13/3/2022,847 words,Glen Owen,"GOVE: SEIZE OLIGARCH MANSIONS TO HOUSE REFUGEES; As No10 pledges £350 a month for those who take in families fleeing war, Minister has an even bolder plan... EXCLUSIVE","RUSSIAN oligarchs' multi-millionpound mansions would be seized and used to house Ukrainian refugees under an extraordinary plan being championed by Michael Gove. The Levelling Up Secretary has argued passionately in Cabinet that the move would be 'payback' for Russian President Vladimir Putin's cronies in Britain. His plan is being blocked by senior figures in the Treasury and the Foreign Office who believe it is 'not legally workable', but one supporter of the Gove scheme last night angrily described opponents within Government as 'oligarch apologists'. The row came as No10 announced that ordinary families who house Ukrainian refugees will be paid £350 a month under a new 'Homes for Ukraine' scheme. It's hoped that tens of thousands of people will be accommodated under the scheme, helping to tackle Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. More than 2.3million people have fled the war in Ukraine and another 1.9million are displaced within the country, a United Nations official has said. The plans come after the Home Office was heavily criticised for its 'chaotic' response to the humanitarian disaster. In contrast, the British people have acted quickly and generously to help. The recordbreaking Mail Force Ukraine Appeal has reached a remarkable £6.6million alone. In another grim day in Ukraine yesterday: Kyiv became a fortress ahead of an expected onslaught, with Russian forces now within 15 miles of the capital's centre; Russian shelling of besieged cities including Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Dnipro and Sumy continued as one governor said the South-Eastern city of Volnovakha has been destroyed; Putin rebuffed a new appeal for a ceasefire but, in a glimmer of hope, negotiators discussed 'concrete' proposals for a peace deal for first time as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was willing to negotiate, but would not surrender nor accept ultimatums; Zelensky said 79 children had been killed in Ukraine during the war and 1,300 Ukrainian troops, but claimed the Russian army has suffered its largest losses in decades, with an estimated 6,000 deaths; Moscow threatened the West that any military shipments to Ukraine will be seen as 'legitimate targets', prompting fears the conflict could dramatically escalate; Putin was urged to lift the siege of the southern city of Mariupol where more than 1,500 civilians have died; Residents took to the streets of the occupied city of Melitopol to protest against the abduction of its mayor by Russian forces; Intelligence sources claimed Putin may be suffering from dementia, Parkinson's disease or 'roid rage' resulting from steroid treatment for cancer. Mr Gove, who first raised the prospect of seizing oligarchs' homes in Cabinet a fortnight ago, ran into opposition last week at the first meeting of a sub-committee looking into the UK's refugee response. At the meeting, Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly and Treasury Minister John Glen expressed their departments' reservations about the idea. Last night, a backer of Mr Gove's plan said: 'The opposition is being led by oligarch apologists who hide behind the rule of law.' But one of Mr Gove's opponents said the plan is 'not legally workable' and condemned it as 'gesture politics more suited to a banana republic'. Under the 'Homes for Ukraine' scheme, sponsors who provide accommodation rent-free for a minimum of six months will receive a 'thank you' of £350 per month, however many refugess they take. Sponsored refugees will be granted three years leave to remain in the UK and be allowed to work and access public services. Mr Gove said: 'The crisis in Ukraine has sent shockwaves across the world. The UK stands behind Ukraine in their darkest hour and the British public understand the need to get as many people to safety as quickly as we can. I urge people across the country to join the national effort and offer support to our Ukrainian friends.' A website will launch tomorrow to allow sponsors to register offers of accommodation. Those applying will be vetted and Ukrainians will undergo security checks. However, as The Mail on Sunday reports today, security chiefs have expressed concern at watering down visa requirements. Home Secretary Priti Patel has been criticised over the slow rate of approval of visas for Ukrainian refugees, prompting Boris Johnson to demand an end to 'hostile leaks' from within her department. But many organisations are already stepping up, such as London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, which is set to receive ten children with cancer who were evacuated from Ukraine in an incredible rescue mission. Meanwhile, Chelsea Football Club was thrown a lifeline by the Government yesterday as officials agreed it could be sold by its sanctioned owner Roman Ambramovich. And amid calls for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to cut fuel duty as the price of oil spirals because of the sanctions, Mr Johnson is set to travel to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to negotiate increased supplies. Tomorrow the PM will host leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a Northern European security coalition, at Chequers. Comment: Page 24",Tabloid,1
30,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,7/6/2023,298 words,David Barrett,Boat migrants will be put on ex-cruise liners,"CHANNEL boat migrants will be housed on cruise ships for the first time, the Daily Mail can reveal today. Rishi Sunak announced the acquisition of two vessels on Monday and it can now be confirmed they are passenger liners. They will house up to 1,000 small boat migrants between them but the ships' names are being withheld by the Home Office. Although cruise liners have not before been used for Channel arrivals they have hosted Ukrainian refugees in Scotland. One of the vessels secured by the Home Office is thought to be heading for Merseyside. The site being looked at for the other cruise ship is unclear but Teesport, near Middlesbrough, is thought to be a contender. Newcastle, Felixstowe in Suffolk, Harwich in Essex and the Royal London Docks are also under consideration, The Guardian reported. In a speech at Dover on Monday Mr Sunak said: 'To reduce pressures on local communities, we'll also house people on ships. The first will arrive in Portland in the next fortnight. And we've secured another two that will accommodate another 1,000.' The Mail reported yesterday that the French authorities are intercepting more than half of the crossings, compared with four in ten last year. About 7,600 people have crossed the Channel illegally so far this year, down from just under 10,000 in the same period last year. Using hotels as migrant accommodation is costing the taxpayer £6million a day. Former Ministry of Defence bases at Wethersfield in Essex and Scampton in Lincolnshire are due to receive their first migrants soon with numbers rising to 3,000 by autumn. Civil servants are also planning accommodation centres at Bexhill, East Sussex, and Catterick, North Yorkshire. Last night Dorset Council said it was dropping a challenge against the Home Office's plan for the Portland ship.",Tabloid,1

But with Covid firmly behind us and the adult population overwhelmingly vaccinated, it is now safe to get together. Yet disgracefully, the Left-wing Whitehall workforce is brazenly defying ministerial pleas to return to their desks. If the NHS, transport and shop workers who risked their lives during lockdown had pouted like the privileged public sector 'blob', the country would have collapsed. The civil service union (which, risibly, denounced the idea of going back to the office as 'vindictive') insists staff operate just as efficiently at home. But that's bilge. Working from a spare room is less productive. Tasks take longer. Telephone calls and emails go unanswered. It is clear from the abysmal performance on issuing driving licences, visas for Ukrainian refugees and passports that we are being shortchanged. Efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he warns that those who refuse to return to Whitehall risk losing extra pay and perks. Ministers have promised a cull of bloated civil servant numbers. If the troublemakers dig their heels in, they will only have themselves to blame when the axe falls.",Tabloid,0

Once again the pats on the back are cringe-making, with a knighthood for Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office's top mandarin. This is even though he has been accused of thwarting ministers' attempts to stop Channel crossings and undermining the plan to send some migrants to Rwanda. It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. Let's restrict honours to people who work hard to help their local communities for no reward. Civil servants seem to expect a gong as part of their well-paid jobs. PAUL MARSTON, Walsall, W. Mids. NANNY Louenna Hood raised £190,000 for Ukrainian refugees and is given the lowest honour, the British Empire Medal (BEM), while a top civil servant who blocked the Government's plans to tackle migration is awarded a knighthood. It's time the honours system was reviewed. JACQUELINE INSTONE, Darlington, Co. Durham. FOUR of the Lionesses have been awarded gongs for services to women's football but the other members of the team were blanked. An indication, if one were needed, of how utterly perverse the honours nonsense is. B. CHANNING, Pembroke. IT HAS been claimed that it was decided not to honour every member of the women's football team that won the first nondomestic trophy since 1966 because of the danger of 'carpet-bombing'.

37,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,21/3/2022,560 words,Chris Brooke,UK-bound refugees 'sleeping rough' due to red tape delays; war in ukraine,"UKRAINIAN refugees waiting for UK visas are being forced to sleep rough amid anger over red tape delays. Host families have slammed the 'nightmarish' bureaucracy that is said to be prolonging the process for women and children who have fled the conflict. Volunteers have warned that delays could be putting refugees at risk amid claims of trafficking. Under the first phase of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, Britons can sponsor refugees for a visa and offer them a rent-free room in their house. Once a host family has been found, refugees must complete visa application forms - providing identity documents and answers to detailed questions in English. There is then a further wait before the visa is issued, with government information saying the process can take up to six weeks. Ruth McMenamin, a volunteer in Poland, said that UK-bound refugees were sleeping in train stations and emergency accommodation as they awaited permission to travel. The marketing head, who works for a travel company in the UK, added: 'There are dangers in having to wait around for applications to be processed as these women and children have nowhere to live. There are reports of trafficking. 'The process needs to be sped up. Other countries are allowing people to go straight there.' Although the first refugees under the scheme are due to arrive this week, host families have said they have 'absolutely no idea' how long the process will take. Lee Havenhand, 33, and his wife Rebecca, 30, are to share their three-bedroom home with a mother and two daughters. The couple, who live near Doncaster were 'matched' with the family through a Facebook site and were inspired to help after having visited Ukraine regularly for holidays. Engineer Mr Havenhand said he helped the family, from Lviv in western Ukraine, with the visa process by filling in the required forms for them. But he added: 'It's a good job we did because the forms are an absolute nightmare. They took us six hours because of the amount of information and evidence that is required. 'It asks for children's birth certificates - which is a problem for many people who have already fled their homes. They also ask for proof of father's consent, which is not always possible if he has gone off to fight in the war. 'It's a shambles. We just have to cross our fingers that it is going to go through soon.' A 58-year-old woman, who is to share her home in Derbyshire with a Ukrainian woman and two daughters, also said the process was 'absolutely impossible'. The married woman, who asked not to be named, said the refugees she had been matched with had travelled from a village near Lviv to Berlin but wanted to move to the UK as the elder daughter spoke English. However, the 'traumatised' family have been sleeping on the floor of a rest centre while they wait for visas. 'There is no way on God's given earth that they could have filled those forms in,' she said. 'There are huge risks because of the information and detail I had to give as well - certainly enough to steal your identity. To make it worse, nobody knows how long it will take.' A government spokesman said it is making changes to the visa process so it is 'quicker and simpler' for Ukrainian refugees. These include expanding capacity at Visa Application Centres and allowing valid passport holders to miss in-person appointments. 'Dangers in having to wait around'",Tabloid,1
57,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,8/12/2022,805 words,Jenni Murray,What next when the joy of hosting refugees goes sour?,"IT SEEMED such an obvious thing to do. When the Government launched its Homes for Ukraine scheme in March, women and children were amassing at the Ukrainian borders, desperate to escape Russia's indiscriminate bombing. We could help. Households with a bit of space, mine included, could promise to provide support for at least six months in return for £350-a-month payments from the Government. Not that the money seemed to matter. The reason for most of us was simply humane. We could offer comfort and safety. Now, nine months on with little sign of an end to the war, the faults in what seemed such a good idea are starting to manifest themselves. The number of homeless Ukrainian refugees in England are 'spiking dramatically'. My heart goes out to the 900 single people and 2,000 families with children who came here seeking sanctuary and who are now - shockingly - officially homeless. But my sympathy also extends to those who took in desperate refugees but now, faced with the rise in the cost of living, find they simply can't afford to house, feed, heat and give endless assistance to people who need professional care and advice. Very few of us, I suspect, have had any training in how to give psychological support to frightened, damaged families. LAST month one member of my Homes for Ukraine WhatsApp group posted, 'Are we the only ones with a guest struggling deeply with the sound of fireworks? It's horrific.' There are 81 members of the group and it's rare to find reports of host/guest relationships breaking down because of disagreements. Most commonly it's concerns about money. 'I have not had the November payment, either', or 'I haven't been paid at all since September', or 'Any update on the increased payments (or lack thereof)?' The group is a fascinating record of the shift in attitude to hosting. In the early days, there was excitement about picking up guests from the airport, followed quickly by anxiety about visas, home visits, DBS checks, whether or not to cook for your guests and getting the £350 'thank you' payment. One member was grateful for this 'stress-reducing forum'. As time passed, concerns started being raised about what would happen after the promised six months were up. Now the most frequent posts are expressions of deep anxiety about housing options. Natalia, a mother who arrived with her 14-year-old son, is a classic example. She'd been with her host in North London since May. She has a job, earning just over £1,000 a month. Her son is at a local school. She gets Universal Credit. She would like to move out and rent a small flat. But it's incredibly difficult for Ukrainian refugees to find a suitable place they can afford. She would need housing benefit. The job centre isn't forthcoming with advice. Councils don't have the housing stock that's needed. One contributor offered to share her experience of trying to help her guests find accommodation. 'I'd be happy to talk through the minefield of bureaucracy and rental challenges I have encountered. 'The BRP [biometric residence permit, which proves a person's right to stay in the UK] and Universal Credit were a walk in the park compared to this!' Hosts are anxious about what is expected of them. Must they become financial guarantors for their refugees' private rentals? Can their guests depend on the council to house them? The joy of helping the desperate has turned into a sense of shame at wanting your own life back. Some 600 families have reportedly been placed in hotels and other temporary accommodation, and there is hope that the monthly government payments to hosts will increase, but nothing has been agreed. I have not had to face any of these difficulties because my lovely guests, Zoriana and Ustym, left me at the end of September to go home to Ukraine. I miss them and would willingly have hosted them for as long as it took, but I don't think it had ever occurred to me, when I offered a room to a 38-year-old woman and her 17-year-old son, how much frustrating work would be involved in getting the basics in place. If I hadn't had a car, I'm not sure how we would have managed as we chased around London getting their residence permit, National Insurance number, GP registration, bank account, a bit of cash from the council, a church they could go to every Sunday and an introduction to the workings of the trains and buses. Then the hunt for a school, a job for Zoriana and friends for Ustym. At times, it felt like a full-time job. I hear from Zoriana that back in Lviv there's no electricity and no water, and they hide in the basement. But at least they have somewhere they can call home. For too many refugees in the UK it seems a homeless Christmas is a very real possibility. Clearly the Government's humanitarian plan wasn't properly thought through. But it must act now - and fast - to fix it. Follow: @whjm",Tabloid,1
59,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,17/3/2022,705 words,BY DAVID BARRETT HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,FAST-TRACK VISAS TO BE GRANTED WITHIN HOURS',"VISAS for Ukrainians who want to come to Britain should soon be approved within hours', the new refugee minister said yesterday. Lord Harrington told MPs he expected thousands of evacuees to arrive next week under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. More than 138,000 Britons have now offered to open their homes to people fleeing the war. Financial organisations have assured ministers that the £350-a-month thank you' payment to hosts will not affect household insurance terms or mortgage clauses. It is not going to be deemed as a rental payment, it will not be treated as income,' said Lord Harrington. It had already been confirmed that the payments would not affect tax, benefits or council tax allowances. Lord Harrington said security checks would remain a crucial part of the visa process, but added: My instructions were to simplify the process as much as I possibly can. For people with passports it will be quite a seamless process. They will simply get an email back saying you have got permission to travel. I want to get that down to hours.' Asked if checks will be carried out on Homes for Ukraine accommodation before refugees are housed here, Lord Harrington replied: It may not be possible. I'm talking next week, I'm expecting thousands of people to come.' He said it was impossible to give assurances that Ukrainian refugees will not initially be housed in hotels. The Government is setting up a military hub' in south-east Poland to help refugees complete their applications to come to the UK. Armed Forces personnel will oversee help including digital devices and translation services. Abi Tierney, a senior Home Office official, told the Commons home affairs committee it was taking 24 hours to turn around an application. But she said that the 50-question online form that applicants must fill in will be significantly cut down within a few days. Tory MP Adam Holloway said the Government was not doing enough to tackle Channel crossings while doing too little to help Ukrainians: We're completely failing to stop what are essentially economic migrants, mostly fit young men, and yet we're making it incredibly difficult for women and children to come.' The Home Office has now handed out 5,500 Ukraine family scheme visas and received 20,000 applications in all. It came as the Bishop of Dover criticised the Government's policy for refugees. Rose Hudson-Wilkin said: We see on our screens the plight of the people of Ukraine. And I want to tell you this, that deep inside me there has been a rage.'   WANT TO HOST A REFUGEE? THEN GET IN TOUCH WITH ONE OF THESE CHARITIES... A RANGE of specialist charities are poised to help link up British hosts with Ukrainian refugees. The Homes for Ukraine scheme is due to launch tomorrow, but several groups have already started registering interest from volunteers. They include: refugeesathome.org Refugees at Home offers a wide range of information about the process of volunteer hosting and has an online registration process on its website. A spokesman for the charity said: We know from our own experience how many generous hosts are stepping forward to welcome refugees and we have had an unprecedented number of calls over the past two weeks. In the last few weeks, nearly 5,000 people have come forward to host via our website.' resetuk.org Reset Communities and Refugees says it will soon launch a matching portal to pair hosts with refugees in a safe and structured way'. The charity adds: We'll announce the launch of this on our website and social media channels.' Reset urges potential hosts to think through carefully what this will mean to you and your family', saying the Homes for Ukraine scheme will be a huge commitment'. Until the scheme is up and running, the charity urges potential volunteers to research other ways to help refugees. It suggests forming a community sponsorship group that will allow neighbours to welcome people to their areas, offering details about this on its website. shelter4ua.com Shelter 4 Ukraine's website is in Ukrainian but your web browser should offer to translate to English. It includes an online form to express interest in becoming a host, as well as providing other support, including transportation and childcare.   © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1
63,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,23/5/2022,311 words,Chris Brooke,Now your Ukraine stamps help cancer battle,"GENEROUS readers who sent cheques to help Ukrainian refugees can be proud of helping another worthy cause as well. Envelopes enclosing around 70,000 cheques which were sent to the Mail Force appeal are being donated to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) so that the stamps can go towards raising funds for its lifesaving research work. Dozens of bags full of envelopes have been delivered to the charity's headquarters in Leeds and volunteers will cut out the stamps, which will be sorted and sold in bulk by weight. The trust receives up to £20 a kilogram by selling the stamps to amateur and professional collectors across the country. Collectors will often buy large bags of stamps to look for certain postmarks. Unusual stamps and ones with slight defects can also be snapped up by collectors to improve their private collections. Envelopes donated for previous Mail Force appeals to raise funds for computers for children and to buy personal protective equipment for frontline health workers were also passed on to the cancer charity. The Ukraine refugee appeal was kick-started with £500,000 from DMGT, the Mail's parent company, at the request of Lord and Lady Rothermere, and has raised more than £11.5million so far. Laura Riach, the cancer charity's head of fundraising and communications, said: 'We would like to thank the Daily Mail for donating their used stamps to the Bone Cancer Research Trust's Stamp Appeal. We will turn these stamps into vital funds for our life-saving work, which will truly make a difference to all those affected by primary bone cancer. Last year our Stamp Appeal raised an incredible £11,835.' About 560 people are diagnosed with primary bone cancer in the UK every year, with around 355 annual deaths. Since BCRT was formed in 2006, it has awarded over £5.3million for research into finding a cure and funded 106 research projects.

103,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,13/3/2022,478 words,Glen Owen,MI6 warned Priti Patel not to relax visa rules,"SECURITY chiefs have warned Priti Patel not to water down visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees because of the risk they could include Islamic State terrorists, mercenaries and mafia-linked criminals, The Mail on Sunday has learned. The Home Secretary has faced intense political pressure over the past week for the low number of refugees being allowed in to the UK, contributing to renewed speculation over her political future. But senior intelligence sources said Ms Patel had been 'placed in a very difficult position' because MI5 and MI6 had warned against a 'knee-jerk' reaction to the humanitarian crisis which could store up security problems for the future. Pressure has grown on Ms Patel after a number of stories appeared in the media criticising her performance over the issue. In the wake of the reports, Boris Johnson called Matthew Rycroft, Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, to demand a crackdown on 'hostile leaks' about Ms Patel - the latest evidence of tensions between the Home Secretary and her civil servants, who have been accused of obstructing her aims. Many IS soldiers are believed to have travelled to Ukraine from Syria after Russia intervened to aid President Bashar Assad's forces in 2015. They then joined the fight against Russia in separatist regions in the east of Ukraine. Chechen mercenaries are also fighting in the war on both sides, while security services also fear hardened criminals have been released from prison by both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes to fight. Organised crime bosses from Belurus are also believed to have entered Ukraine More than 1.5 million refugees have crossed the border into Poland since the start of the war, gaining them access to the EU. An intelligence source said: 'Noone disputes that this is a humanitarian tragedy, and that 99.9 per cent of the refugees are genuine. But we cannot just allow a complete open-door policy. 'Ukraine is a melting pot at the moment, and we have already been presented with fake passports. 'People talk about Poland being ""more generous"" than the UK but it's not that - their border has ceased to exist in any meaningful fashion, so we have to make sure we are not storing up problems for the future. 'The Home Secretary is right not to mount a knee-jerk response on emotional grounds. She has been put in a very difficult position'. The security services have also argued against plans for an online visa system, arguing that it would be too vulnerable to hacking by Moscow agents - both to sabotage it and to glean information about applicants. In addition, the security services are understood to have advised against an upscaled visa processing centre in Calais, fearing it would exercise too much of a 'pull factor' and could expose female refugees to the risk of coming into contact with people-traffickers.

117,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,18/9/2022,1411 words,NA,Inside story: how Ital y is still dressing Russia; Big-name brands are facing a dilemma over whether to continue selling their goods in Russia. So which ones are putting cashflow before conscience? John Hooper investigates IllustratIon: marcos FARINA,"The scene is an upmarket fashion store in Florence. A cheery middle-aged Russian couple have finished selecting their clothes and are ready to pay. The man brings out a roll of freshly minted (EURO)100 notes and starts to peel them one by one on to the counter. Russians, even those with foreign bank accounts, cannot pay by card because of sanctions imposed by Britain, the EU and the US in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'How many of these can we accept?' calls out the assistant as the crisp green notes pile up in front of her. Italy limits the amount of cash used to pay for a single transaction ? a ceiling imposed to curb tax evasion. The manageress appears and a solution is reached. The man and the woman divide their purchases to stay within the (EURO)2,000 limit and walk out smiling with two bags that bulge with elegant designer garments. These are difficult times for the fashion business. And nowhere more so than in Italy where large swathes of the population depend on design for their livelihood. An industry normally focused on turning taste into turnover all of a sudden found itself grappling with article 3h of European Council regulation 833/2014 (an amendment of 428/2022). This is the EU ordinance which bans the export to Russia of luxury goods ? anything on a long list of almost 50 kinds of apparel with a price tag of more than (EURO)300. For most of the continental fashion houses the sanction represents a ban on all shipments to Russia. But firms making cheaper pieces can continue to export without busting the regulations. Whether they are morally right to do so is another matter. A department of Yale University in the US has been assiduously tracking the reaction of corporations to the invasion of Ukraine. Firms have a legal obligation to respect sanctions, but because of the way the regulations have been framed, some companies do not need to abide by them. Others that respect the sanctions to the letter can nevertheless find that their wares still end up on sale in Russia, after having been diverted from a third country to which they have been legally exported. Opponents of Vladimir Putin's war who fled abroad say that friends in Russia can still buy many of the luxury items that were available before the invasion through Russian online retailers. 'The only difference is that they have to wait for seven days for the clothes or shoes to be delivered,' said a dissident who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. Yale's 29-strong team of researchers grades the firms from A ('companies halting Russian engagements or completely exiting Russia') all the way down to F ('companies continuing business as usual in Russia'). Many of the luxury Italian brands ? Moncler, Salvatore Ferragamo, Prada and Zegna ? are rated B, the grade awarded to 'companies temporarily curtailing nearly all operations while keeping return options open'. Many French and German competitors are in the same category. A senior executive at one of the big Italian fashion houses says that since the embargo on luxury goods took effect in March, 'we've not shipped so much as a tiepin to Russia'. In the short term, the ban will cost his and similar companies surprisingly little. The figures give an impression that Italy's couturiers do not rely on selling to the family of Russian oligarchs. Valentino disclosed earlier this year that sales in Russia accounted for a mere three per cent of its turnover. But that omits all the beautiful gowns, shoes and bags purchased by Russian tourists abroad, whether in Rome, Portofino or in shops elsewhere such as London, Paris and New York. All those sales remain perfectly legal, as the Russian couple in Florence demonstrated. In the longer term, however, there may be a price to pay. The fashion houses risk being sued in the Russian courts. Most do not own the stores in which their wares are sold. They are run by local franchise-holders with whom they have contracts. And, in many cases, the brands are in breach of those contracts because they are not supplying their Russian partners with goods, particularly those priced under (EURO)300 not subject to the embargo. 'This is an area in which companies have struggled to balance their legal obligations with doing the right thing,' says Tom Cummins, a partner at Ashurst, a London law firm that has been advising firms on the sanctions. Set against the legal risks of cutting off supplies to Russia are the reputational dangers of exporting items that are not covered by the sanctions. 'Consumers may well say, ""I don't want to buy your products any more because you're continuing to profit from business in Russia,""' says Cummins. 'Young people are particularly sensitive to ethical issues.' In fashion, the further you go down the market where products cost less than (EURO)300 and young consumers are in a majority, the trickier the balancing act becomes. Milan-based Yoox, the global online retail giant, is an example of a firm that could have continued working with Russia but decided not to. Its website offers plenty of products under (EURO)300. But within days of the invasion it suspended all its activities in Russia, posting a message in Russian on its website that read: 'Due to the current situation, we are unable to complete any new orders in your country.' According to Yale, however, four of the best-known names in Italian fashion have taken a different approach. Armani, Benetton, Diesel and Calzedonia have all been consigned to the 'sin bin' with the lowest possible grade, accused of carrying on as if nothing had happened. The most surprising is Armani, since it hardly belongs to the cut-price end of the market, even if its Emporio Armani stores appeal to a young clientele. When asked to comment, the Armani group issued a statement that said it 'does not operate directly in Russia and the shops operating in the country with the brands of the group are managed by independent franchisees'. It added that Armani 'adheres with strict compliance to the sanctions regime issued by the EU'. A spokesman said the group had suspended its online sales, but did not respond to a question as to whether it was exporting products priced less than (EURO)300 to the shops operating under its brand name. Diesel said that it had closed its online activities. It stressed that it did not have shops of its own in Russia and that it was respecting the sanctions while noting that they do not apply to products selling for less than (EURO)300. Calzedonia simply refused to discuss the matter. As for Benetton, a company that for decades has linked its products to notions of diversity and racial equality, its website declares: 'Social responsibility is intrinsic to Benetton Group and has always been expressed through a way of ""doing business"" that is based on principles of respect for the environment and people ? at all levels ? and on campaigns defending human rights.' True to these fine principles, after the invasion, 'Benetton Group immediately expressed its deepest concern for the ongoing dramatic humanitarian crisis,' according to a statement provided to YOU. 'Within this context, the company has decided to suspend all its development business plans in Russia, allocating its commercial investments in favour of humanitarian assistance for the Ukrainian people handled by the Italian Red Cross.' The Italian conglomerate has 'also donated garments to Ukrainian refugees and is providing protection and support to Ukrainian refugees in Italy,' the statement said. But donating clothes and cash is one thing and, in the present circumstances, putting future investment on hold might even be seen as a sound business decision. But what about stopping business in Russia to make the point that invading another sovereign nation does not square with respect for people 'at all levels', let alone 'defending human rights'?No dice. 'Benetton Group,' the statement continued, 'has decided to continue its commercial activities in Russia, based on longstanding relationships with commercial and logistical partners and on a network of stores employing over 600 families.' For some fashion houses, expressing solidarity with Ukraine does not translate into halting commercial operations in Russia. But whether customers understand that and whether it will influence their choices as consumers remains to be seen.

122,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,12/12/2022,733 words,Jason Groves,Asylum crisis could take up majority of aid budget,"MORE than half of Britain's aid budget could be swallowed up by the cost of housing asylum seekers and refugees in the UK, MPs have been warned. In an extraordinary admission to Parliament, international development minister Andrew Mitchell said he had been forced to 'pause' all decisions on aid funding because Home Office demands on his budget were 'effectively out of control'. Mr Mitchell said the astonishing cost of dealing with asylum seekers and refugees this year meant that conventional foreign aid might account for as little as 25 per cent of the overall £11billion aid budget. He said officials had now been ordered to slash the cost of aid projects by 30 per cent 'across the whole portfolio of bilateral [aid] spend'. Mr Mitchell described the cuts as 'very harsh indeed' and warned they would have a 'very severe effect... on the people we are trying to help'. Asked if conventional aid spending might account for as little as 25 per cent of the budget this year, he replied: 'Those figures sound about right.' The warning will pile pressure on the Government to tackle the soaring cost of housing tens of thousands of Channel migrants in hotels while their cases are processed. In his summer leadership campaign, Rishi Sunak pledged to end the 'hotel farce' by delivering thousands of new beds, including on cruise ships. But no new policy to deal with the problem has been set out. International rules allow countries to classify domestic refugee and asylum costs as aid spending for the first year that someone is in the country. Official figures show that the Home Office share of foreign aid spending jumped by 73 per cent to more than £1billion, fuelled by costs associated with Channel migrants and Afghan refugees. The figure this year is expected to be far higher, with hotel costs alone now estimated to be at least £7million a day, while experts have prethis dicted that costs associated with helping large numbers of Ukrainian refugees could reach £3billion. Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairman of the Commons international development committee, described the scale of the raid as 'shocking'. She said: 'The rules allow for one year but no other country in the world is putting the entire cost of resettling refugees on their development budget. The Home Office spending is rising very rapidly - the minister himself acknowledges it is out of control - and it is resulting in very deep cuts to aid programmes. 'The department has not disputed this was costing £3billion by the summer and it is likely to be double that now, and even higher by the end of the financial year. They are taking from the poorest in the world, and the irony is the great majority of the development spending would have been going on stabilising fragile states, which would help reduce migration pressures.' Mr Mitchell said the Treasury had agreed to increase the aid budget by £2.5billion over the next two years to help take the strain. And he said that he was working with the Treasury and Home Office to try and reduce the cost of dealing with asylum seekers. But he said he had been forced to pause spending 'because the budget was effectively out of control'. He added: 'The pause was to enable us to regroup. We are now regrouping and these very substantial reductions in expenditure are being agreed and negotiated by officials.' He also acknowledged that his own department had to do more to control spending, including finally ending aid to China and India, which he described as 'virtually impossible to defend'. Last year the UK sent the two powers more than £140million in aid. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office was asked to respond, but a spokesman said the department had 'nothing to add' to Mr Mitchell's comments. Meanwhile, Whitehall sources confirmed that Mr Sunak is continuing to work on a package of measures to curb the soaring numbers crossing the Channel illegally. Options include adding Albania to a 'white list' of safe countries from which people are no longer allowed to claim asylum. Former Cabinet minister David Davis yesterday acknowledged that the move would not 'solve the whole problem', but said it was an essential first step. Mr Davis told Times Radio that without action to tackle the crisis 'none of us' will get elected again. 'I mean, putting it bluntly, we'll get punished at the polls,' he said.

Two years on from the start of the Covid pandemic, many government departments are not even at half their capacity. Several key ministries - including the Foreign Office and Department for Education - had on average less than a third of staff in the office over the first week in April, data shows. Now, in a letter to the Secretaries of State, Mr Rees-Mogg, the minister for government efficiency, said 'significant progress' was needed to get offices back to full capacity. Critics of home working claim it makes staff less productive and creative, damages career prospects and harms the economies of town centres. While the number of staff at their desks in Whitehall has increased in recent weeks, it remains well below pre-pandemic levels despite the end of Covid curbs. The Department for Education had just 25 per cent of staff in the office in the week beginning April 4 - although officials said the school holidays meant it was not representative. Despite multiple pressures on the Home Office, including migrant crossings and processing visas for Ukrainian refugees, on average only 42 per cent of staff were at their workplace. The Foreign Office, a key department responding to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, saw just 31 per cent of staff in its King Charles Street building that week. And despite the cost of living crisis, the Department for Work and Pensions had just 27 per cent of its civil servants at their desks. Astonishingly, the figures could overestimate the numbers in the office as some departments recorded the figures by asking security staff to click people in - and then loosely adjusted the figures to account for lunch breaks. Other departments used data from pass readers. The figures suggest that a plea issued by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Steve Barclay three months ago for departments to return to full occupancy fell on deaf ears. In his letter to Cabinet ministers, Mr Rees-Mogg wrote: 'We must continue to accelerate the return of civil servants to office buildings to realise the benefits of face-to-face, collaborative working and the wider benefits for the economy. To deliver this, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and I urge you to issue a clear message to civil servants in your department to ensure a rapid return to the office.' He also said the figures 'show we have significant progress to make'. Tory MPs urged Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to 'bang the desk' to get civil servants back into Whitehall. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, of the 1922 Committee, said: 'There are severe signs of the civil service not being as effective as it should be - and I think that's because for the bulk of the period they need to be back at work.' But the FDA civil service union accused Mr Rees-Mogg of 'micromanaging'. It added: 'Ministers should be concerned with what is being delivered by civil servants, not where their desk is.' A government spokesman said: 'Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored.' On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed that departments allowed staff to work in the office for only two days a week. When civil servants were sent home in the first lockdown, it led to 'backlog Britain' as motorists, travellers and new parents were left waiting months for vital documents that could not be processed remotely. One mandarin, Sarah Healey, admitted she enjoyed being at home so she could ride her Peloton exercise bike.

140,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,24/2/2023,945 words,Lord Ashcroft,The proof Putin will never break Ukraine's brave spirit - and why the West must not waver in its support,"IFIRST visited Ukraine in 2018 to meet soldiers in the trenches of the Donbas region, who were defending their country from Russian-backed separatists. I have been fortunate to return several times, and I'm in Kyiv again today to show my support on the anniversary of the invasion. Nobody who has followed events over the last year could fail to be moved by the resilience and determination of the Ukrainian people. My latest polling only underlines that. Most people here are prepared for the war to last months or even years longer, and I have found no appetite for any compromise with Russia or trading territory for peace. 'Victory is the 1991 borders [the official territory declared when Ukraine proclaimed itself an independent state, free from the USSR] and joining Nato, as well as returning Crimea to Ukraine. That is a minimum,' as one Kyiv resident said. But even after that, the threat from Russia would remain, probably longer than Putin himself. 'We need to become more like Israel,' said another. 'Since 1947 they have lived in a war situation. We need to learn from them how to live in a condition of war.' While 85 per cent of Ukrainians say the defence of their country is progressing successfully - compared with 57 per cent of Russians who say the same of Putin's 'special military operation' - they want more help. We can be proud that they think Britain has done more than most - indeed, Boris Johnson still rivals President Zelensky himself in popularity. B UT while I found voters in Britain and the US most willing to offer humanitarian aid and diplomatic support to help reach a peace deal, these were some way down the priority list for Ukrainians themselves: They would most like weapons and military equipment, admission to Nato, and a no-fly zone over Ukraine patrolled by allied air forces. If support from allies has so far been strong, there are worrying signs of fatigue. While around half of the public in Britain and the US think their governments are providing roughly the right amount of help to Ukraine, a quarter of Americans - including four in ten of those who voted for Trump in 2020 - say they are already giving too much military support. Only half of Republicans are happy to supply weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, compared with three quarters of Democrats. In Britain, Conservatives are keener to help militarily, while Labour voters are much more willing to accept further Ukrainian refugees. In Britain, too, more than two-thirds of the public think we have a direct interest in ensuring Russia's defeat - or that helping Ukraine is simply the right thing to do. Only just over half of Americans agree. Six in ten Ukrainians now believe Putin has the support of most Russians, a figure that has crept up since the invasion, and my polling suggests they are right. More than three-quarters of Russians surveyed said they support the 'operation' - and 85 per cent have a positive view of their president. Focus groups conducted online with people in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg exposed plenty of complaints about life - rocketing prices, shoddy goods, poor services and endemic corruption. But citizens laid the blame elsewhere. 'It is not our president, his head is busy with more important issues,' one Russian told us. 'Sometimes he appoints people, and they make mistakes and he replaces them with other people. Though actually, the rate of mistakes is very high.' Despite the absence of a quick victory, Putin has managed to control the narrative inside Russia to a remarkable degree. Around eight in ten Russians say the US or Nato is responsible for the war - that's nearly twice as many as blame Russia itself. Four-fifths also believe Nato expansion is a threat to Russian sovereignty and that action in Ukraine was needed to protect national security. E VEN so, 'not everything is going according to the objectives', as one focus-group member put it. 'On the battlefield the situation is terrible. Relatives are buying uniforms and food. People are mobilised but they send them there without taking care of them.' Many feel their government underestimated their adversary and six in ten Russians say Ukraine is resisting more strongly than they expected. Yet there is little demand for Russia to cut its losses. Many feel that whatever the reasons were for beginning this 'operation' in the first place, it now has to be seen through. There is also disdain for Russians who have left the country to avoid the draft. 'My husband ran away to Europe and I decided to divorce him,' one woman said. 'If he can't defend the country, I don't need him as a husband.' Not everyone is so staunchly supportive of the Kremlin, though. Nearly three in ten young Russians said they opposed the invasion, and a large majority of them want to see negotiations to end the war. But, equally, no one should run away with the idea that the Russians who are sceptical of military action are also pro-West: Few have a positive view of Western countries or organisations, and a majority thinks the allied nations are more interested in attacking Russia than in liberating Ukraine. Yet despite all this, Ukrainians are not just determined but also optimistic. Nearly seven in ten say they are more confident in their ability to defeat Putin than they were a year ago. 'They expected an easy victory,' said one Kyiv resident. 'They didn't consider that we are not slaves, we are civilised people. Nobody expected how the nation would unite.'

In the noughties, Ireland's newly-minted millionaires would park their choppers on its helipad before swaggering past lakes, statues and fountains on to the first tee of a championship golf course designed by Ryder Cup hero Christy O'Connor Jnr. On loungers around the 20-metre indoor pool of its spa complex, their wellmaintained wives might rub shoulders with strapping players from the national rugby and football teams, who used the hotel as a training base. Between 2010 and 2019, every Taoiseach (Prime Minister) held their party's annual gathering there. 'Citywest is a luxury resort with all that you'd expect on hand: top restaurants, stylish bars, a first-rate leisure club and a ????????????????? ??????? ????? ????????? declared one national newspaper's travel ?????????????& <'! ??????????????????????? But that was then. When Covid struck, Citywest was forced to lock its revolving brass doors. And when the venue eventually re-opened, things looked very different.

On Wednesday, the latter group was ???????????????? ????? ?6$ 7! ?? coaches and minibuses driven in convoy from central Dublin under the watchful eye of an array of rolling TV news crews. T HESE young men had endured a ??????????? ???? ?????$ 6 ? ? they'd been sleeping in tents on the pavements adjacent to the International Protection Office, a Government building where newcomers to Ireland must present themselves to lodge asylum claims. They were then rudely awakened by security guards and given a few minutes to board, with all their belongings, before being whisked away to their new home. Around 200 empty tents were lifted into refuse lorries by cranes, while a team of men in white hazmat suits tossed away any remaining debris before clearing the pavement using high pressure hoses. The operation was designed to demolish what Taoiseach Simon Harris has called a 'makeshift shanty town' that had sprung up in the heart of Ireland's supposedly prosperous capital city. It also marked an effort to defuse a toxic political row that has been escalating for almost two years, over the unprecedented number of refugees and asylum seekers rocking up on these shores. And, as we shall see later, it was also triggered by a simmering dispute over the effects of Rishi Sunak's Rwanda policy. To understand the saga, we must begin with a few numbers. Ireland is a relatively small country, where a rapidly-growing population of just 5million (up from 3.5million in the 1990s) has precipitated a severe housing crisis that means around 15,000 of its citizens are homeless and millions of young people regard property ownership as a pipe dream. Yet since the start of 2022, it has taken in 105,000 Ukrainian refugees plus almost 35,000 asylum seekers from other countries. These incomers now account for almost three per cent of the population ? the equivalent of two million arriving in the UK ? and the vast majority are being accommodated, at the Irish taxpayer's expense, in a range of hotels, hostels and other previously empty buildings. When I visited Ireland last year, a quarter of hotel beds were being used to house refugees and asylum seekers under a scheme now costing more ??????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????? !""# $# found the situation causing severe harm to social cohesion.

All of which brings us back to the Citywest hotel. Walking through its grounds is now a surreal experience. Fountains have been switched off, the helipad is overgrown and the ankle-deep grass covering the greens and fairways of its abandoned golf course are thick with dandelions and other weeds. While piped easylistening music still plays in reception areas and staff still wear smart blue uniforms, only 95 employees remain from a previous ??????????6%&7!7 ????????????????? In the car park, I bump into Hermann Kelly, president of the Irish Freedom Party, a Eurosceptic outfit on the right of the political spectrum. He's wandering the grounds filming content for social media in the run-up to June's European elections. There's plenty to get his juices 'This used to be one of the best hotels in Ireland. If you could afford to come here then you'd really arrived. Now people from other countries are being allowed to live here full-time for free and the people are paying,' he says to camera. 'It's madness.' Kelly seems particularly angered at the sight of luxury cars, including BMWs, Nissan SUVs and one spanking Mercedes, bearing Ukrainian number plates. Working-class Irish taxpayers are, he declares, paying for the three free meals a day that the high-end vehicles' owners are being provided with in its restaurants. 'We are the idiots of the world for allowing this to happen,' he says. 'It's a huge drain on the financial resources and security and has turned Ireland from a high-trust, low-friction society into a lowtrust, high-friction one.' Exhibit A, on this front, are the bus loads of asylum seekers being unloaded outside the convention centre. For these 138 mostly young men, around a third of whom hail from Nigeria, were this week the subject of an intriguing diplomatic row between Ireland and the UK. To understand why, we must first appreciate why they had been living in tents outside the International Protection Office.

Predictable friction ensued, with locals ? sick at having to navigate growing piles of litter and human waste en route to the area's upscale coffee shops ? clashing with refugee charities who'd plastered the tents with hoardings urging the government to 'stop normalising cruelty'. Facing criticism from both sides, Mr Harris's Government then managed to elevate the ugly situation into a full-blown diplomatic row by attempting to blame it on the old enemy: Great Britain. How so? Well here's where things get very interesting indeed. F OR official figures suggest ??????????????????????? ???? cent of the 6,739 asylum seekers who have appeared in Ireland this year came directly from the UK. And according to deputy PM Micheal Martin, one of the main factors behind so many of them choosing to move to the Emerald Isle is that staying in Britain might see them sent to Rwanda. In other words, Rishi Sunak's scheme appears to be at least partly working, even before it has properly started. Or as Mr Martin put it: 'I believe the Rwanda effect is impacting on Ireland.' ????? was open to letting Ireland join the scheme, with a Downing Street source saying: 'If the Irish government believes the Rwanda plan is already having an effect, we can explore Ireland joining.' Whether or not London and Dublin come to such an agreement, there is one further irony. For the principal reason asylum seekers are able to move so freely from our country to Dublin is the Irish government's insistence, during the Brexit negotiations, that there should be 'no hard border' between their country and Northern Ireland. This state of affairs, created during negotiations that Harris and Martin were party to, has allowed thousands of UK-based asylum seekers (this year's figures are up ????????????????????????????????????? from Liverpool to Belfast, then a bus or train to the Republic. Although a post-Brexit 'co-operation agreement' might in theory allow Ireland to return them to the UK, it has no legal standing. And Mr Sunak said this week that he's 'not interested' in doing a deal that would allow enforcement 'when the EU doesn't accept returns back to France where illegal migrants are coming from'. Further adding to Mr Harris's woes, the Irish High Court in March ruled that Britain is no longer a 'safe country' to return failed asylum seekers to due to the Rwanda policy, in a case brought by a group including a convicted Iraqi sex offender who the authorities wished to return to the UK. ]$67 asylum seekers who were supposed to have been removed from Ireland since the start of last year. Thanks to a combination of bureaucratic inertia, incompetence and endless legal challenges, ?????????????????6&$ $ ??????????????????????????????? Fallout from this affair has not only been a PR disaster for the Irish government but is causing ugly scenes in the places where the authorities have decided these people should live. Only last week, six people were arrested for public order offences during four nights of anti-migrant protests at Newtownmountkennedy, a small town in County Wicklow, over plans to turn a disused guest house into an accomm Four people were charged after rocks were thrown at Gardai and the window of a police car smashed by a man wielding an axe. Several proposed accommodation centres have recently been the subject of arson, including the disused 19th century Lake House country hotel in Rosscahill, Galway, and the Great Southern Hotel in the seaside town of Rosslare, County Wexford, which was targeted by petrol bombs. There was a riot in Dublin last November after the stabbing of three children and a care assistant outside a primary school by a man initially rumoured to be an illegal immigrant. And recent months have seen increasing fears for the safety of politicians, with Justice Minister Helen McEntee, who many blame for the spiralling crisis, targeted three times with bomb threats. One resulted in her husband and two young children being evacuated from their home. Much of the anger is being fuelled by class resentment, since it's poorer communities that inevitably suffer the most fallout. Figures released last year showed, to this end, that 581 asylum seekers had been billeted in the gritty Dublin 3 postcode, near ??????????? ???? ????$&%$! ??scrabble suburb of Dublin 22. Meanwhile, in Dublin 4, where civil servants and other white collar professionals inhabit handsome Georgian terraces, locals had to share their neighbourhood with a mere six asylum seekers. 'It's only working -class communities that these people are put into,' says Malachy Steenson, a solicitor from Dublin 3 who is standing as an independent in the forthcoming European elections on an anti-migration ticket. 'People wake up one day and find hundreds of young men, from a completely foreign culture, have been parachuted into their neighbourhood. They have nothing to do all day and the reality is that if you have young men with nothing to do then you will get trouble.' On Wednesday, three busloads of asylum seekers from Dublin's tent city were deposited at a disused nursing home called St Brigid's in Crooksling, a tiny village in the mountains outside Dublin, where they are to be accommodated in military-style tents. B Y THE time I arrived that afternoon, things were getting heated. A small group of angry locals had gathered at the gate, where balaclava-clad security guards maintained an uneasy peace. ????? and we wake up one morning to ????? ???? ????????? ?????? ???? from goodness knows where just dumped here,' said one of the protesters, a nurse called Helen. 'We don't have a shop. We don't even have a pub. There are no amenities and we are an hour from Dublin with a bus that comes every hour and a half. What are they supposed to do all day? It only takes one bad apple for something nasty to happen.' At the heart of their concerns is a feeling of powerlessness: two of the three major parties are in coalition and therefore responsible for current policy. Against this backdrop, Wednesday's demolition of Dublin's tent city feels like little more than window dressing. Indeed, by Thursday afternoon, ??????? ???? ???? ??????? ???????? had arrived at the International Protection Office seeking somewhere to stay. They were handed a letter saying that an 'accommodation shortage' meant 'no further offers of accommodation can be made' and sent on their way. Though the letter warned them not to pitch tents on local streets, by teatime several had instead taken up residence in a nearby park. I later spotted three more tents in a churchyard. All of which speaks to a simple truth: with hundreds of thousands more asylum seekers currently in the UK and no way of preventing them coming to Ireland as the Rwanda policy bites, Dublin's first modern shanty town is unlikely to be its last.

IT'S PRITI AND PIPPA","AND still the people came. Even with dark skies, Day Three of this momentous celebration wasn't about pomp and ceremony, but it did feature rock royalty - from Rod Stewart to Diana Ross, modern stars like Mimi Webb, Sam Ryder and Mabel... and, of course, Queen, with Adam Lambert filling in for the muchmissed Freddie Mercury. On paper this was the Platinum Party at the Palace, at least for those invited. But really it was the People's Day, as much about the Queen thanking her subjects as the other way round, the chance for a bit of fun, come rain or shine. And, as it happened, there was both. All the gold of the pageantry was outshone by the joyous goodwill that descended over Her Majesty's backyard yesterday. It was evident in the way that strangers became instant friends, sharing life stories and Victoria sponge in The Mall. It was in the spontaneous singalong - We'll Meet Again and You'll Never Walk Alone -that filled a corner of St James's Park, and in the way a family of Ukrainian refugees was clapped by the crowd as they waved their yel- low and blue flag outside Buckingham Palace while thanking everyone, including the Queen, for 'making us so welcome'. Flypasts, ceremonial processions, balcony appearances... this had all been the stuff of the first two days of the Jubilee weekend. Nothing notable was due to happen in the capital yesterday, though. Not until the evening when the first acts took the stage for the Buckingham Palace concert. And so the question was: what to do in the meantime? The Queen had urged the nation to use her Platinum Jubilee to make 'happy memories' with their families and friends. And so her people did just that. Down from the shires they came, from towns and cities the length 'They were all drawn as if by a magnetic force' and breadth of the British Isles and beyond. They funnelled out of train and Underground stations and moved towards the Palace as if drawn by a magnetic force. Some were ardent royalists paying solemn tribute to Her Majesty. Many more wanted to simply savour the atmosphere, just to say they had been there. And there were those looking forward to a knees-up, while at the same time professing heartfelt admiration for the Queen. 'She's put in 70 years and she's a bloomin' marvel,' exclaimed 68-year-old Maimie Exley, from Rochester, Kent, to cheers from her friends. With the nation's Covid straitjacket removed, there was no need to feel guilty about being complicit in a super-spreader event. And so, maskless, they danced and sang to any music - be it Nessun Dorma or Reach For The Stars by S Club 7 - that wafted their way. In any case, this party was sanctioned by the Boss herself, who, everyone fervently hoped, was at Windsor with her feet up, feeling better and watching the horse racing on the telly. Genuinely, they didn't seem to mind her absence. An oft-expressed sentiment was that she had done enough already. On a day when republicanism seemed as popular as a sweaty street party sandwich curling on a paper plate, the rapport between the Queen and her people was never warmer. The first to arrive did so at about 8am. In the distance, marching down The Mall from Admiralty Arch, arms aloft, hands together, they appeared as cultish figures. As they drew nearer it transpired that they were filming while walking, with their smartphones and selfie sticks. To think that only one in 66 households owned a TV set when the Queen was crowned in 1953. Some wonderfully barmy souls were there already, of course, having spent a cold night sleeping on The Mall just because they didn't want to miss a second of it - even though it wasn't exactly clear what 'it' might be. There was hardy Elizabeth Ellis, 73, from Manchester, who didn't have a tent or a sleeping bag, but who made a bed out of a mat and her coat and awoke, freezing, to grey skies and spots of rain. She didn't seem to mind a bit. 'I had to be here for this because I really think it will be the last commemorative event of its kind,' she said. 'Sure, if I lived another 500 years I wouldn't see a Monarch reign for seven decades. 'She's part of our culture, isn't she? My very first memory is the Queen's Coronation when I was four. There was a street party. I can clearly remember the jelly and Jubilee murals. I've been a fan of the Royals ever since. It is marvellous how she keeps this country together.' Nearby, a group of ladies grumbled about the tang of dried manure, delivered courtesy of police horses, the smell sharpened by splashes of rain. They cheered when a little Royal Parks truck arrived to clear it away. The patient crowd's wait was, of course, eventually rewarded with an extraordinary concert featuring stars including Queen's Brian May, who famously played on the Buckingham Palace roof 20 years ago, and last night helped the band to open the show. Rod Stewart's performance included Sweet Caroline, the Neil Diamond track that became the anthem for the England football team during last year's European Championships, and Jason Donovan climbed back into his Technicolor Dreamcoat to reprise his West End role as Joseph. Andrew Lloyd Webber joined Lin- Manuel Miranda, the star of the West End musical Hamilton, at a piano and the crowd was thrilled by a high-octane performance by upcoming British singer-songwriter Mimi Webb. Before it all got under way, though, a team of security workers further up The Mall wearing orange ponchos were receiving last-minute instructions from a supervisor. 'Anything could happen out there,' he warned. 'This will be a once-in-alifetime experience, but we need to be on our ""A"" game. Let's go, everyone, fan out...' A group of Chilean tourists on a guided tour were agog to learn of a famous 1982 security breach at the Palace. 'I told them of the time that guy broke in and sat on the Queen's bed,' said the guide afterwards as her group took selfies. 'Chileans just love that story.' By now it was mid-morning and the rain seemed to be falling in five-minute bursts, sending the crowd scampering for the cover of plane trees lining both sides of this famous thoroughfare. Britain in early summer. What did they expect? Well, clearly they weren't sure or didn't care. By now the crowds were arriving in evergrowing numbers. There were women in mini-dresses, tea dresses and shorts and T-shirts and men dressed for Ben Nevis. Those hedging their bets wore both padded jackets and shorts. Fashion designer Marilyn Moore, whose shop on the King's Road in Chelsea was a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge when she was still plain Kate Middleton, assessed all that passed before her. 'It's interesting seeing all the dresses,' she offered tactfully, her husband Rob at her side. 'We came for the atmosphere,' she added. 'I love being here, soaking it up, and I admire the Queen immensely.' Her husband added: 'It is about the people today. It's one of those great communal events, just great that people are coming together after the horrible two years we've all endured. We've been locked up for so long and this is like the cork exploding from the bottle.' Back at the front line, a woman recalled the time she met the Queen during a walkabout in Leicester in the 1970s. She was looked on by her new friends with awed reverence. 'She gave me her hand,' said Maggie Reeve, 74. 'The thing is, you just take her hand, you don't squeeze it and you don't shake it.' The others nodded then fell silent, reflecting, It was lunchtime now, the grey skies had cleared and the sun was shining. 'Has anyone seen that jar of piccalilli?' cried one of Maggie's friends suddenly. Piccalilli, flag-waving, unpredictable weather, singalongs. This was turning into a very British affair. As the afternoon wore on, Maggie admitted to feeling tired. 'But if we get to see Diana Ross on the big screen it will be worth it,' she said. It didn't seem much to ask.

The former prime minister, 55, has filled the vehicle with essential items such as clothes, first aid kits, nappies and sanitary products. He is travelling with two others who volunteer at a food project in his Cotswolds home town of Chipping Norton. In a social media post, Mr Cameron said they would deliver the supplies to the Red Cross in Poland, which has taken in more than 1.9million refugees, according to the United Nations. 'The generosity of the community in West Oxfordshire - and of the British people more generally - has been typically phenomenal,' Mr Cameron posted, alongside an image of him sitting behind the wheel of the lorry. He has volunteered with community group The Chippy Larder, which collected the supplies, for two years. Earlier this week, Mr Cameron called for more humanitarian help to be given to Ukraine. Speaking to Channel 4 News, he called on the Government to return to dedicating 0.7 per cent of gross national income to overseas aid after it was cut to 0.5 per cent last year.

But last night a spokesman for aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska accused the Gov- ernment of colluding with the protesters and claimed the house belongs to a relative. Police were locked in a standoff with the four male activists after they set off the alarm while breaking into the six-storey townhouse linked to the oligarch shortly after midnight. Deripaska - worth an estimated £2.3billion - was sanctioned by the Govern- ment last week for his pro- Kremlin position and the Bel- grave Square mansion is valued at around £50million. The protesters hung ban- ners from the front of the building declaring 'this prop- erty has been liberated' and 'Putin go f*** yourself'. They spent 11 hours inside before riot police smashed the front door open. Last night, four people eventually came down from the balcony and were arrested. Another four were held earlier after trying to access the row of buildings. Graphic   Raid: Riot police storm the Belgrave mansion yesterday",Tabloid,1
219,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,23/1/2022,1731 words,DON T LET THIS MADMAN FORCE US FROM OUR HOMES AGAIN,No Headline In Original,"AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FACE BEING DISPLACED FOR A SECOND TIME PUTIN S MILITARY MACHINE, THESE DEFIANT WOMEN SUM UP AN ENTIRE NATION S FEARS... BY IAN BIRRELL EKATERINA PEREVERZEVA is struggling to stop fears of war tormenting her as vast numbers of Russian forces mass across the border near her home in Ukraine s second city.  Any time could be the last peaceful moment, she said as we talk in a bar. We could be sitting here with a drink as the shelling starts, unaware that people I love might be dying.  The 27-year-old tries not to think about the gathering storm clouds - but she knows all too well how life, families and friendships can be instantly shattered by malevolent Russian president Vladimir Putin. For she was forced to leave another Ukrainian city after it was seized by Kremlin stooges - and is terrified history will repeat itself after she has worked so hard to create a new life in Kharkiv.  I try not to think these thoughts, to calm my fears, to carry on living, says Ekaterina, who set up an arts and human rights website after fleeing Donetsk.  But there s constant fear with this escalation of hostilities. I know how Putin starts wars, since I have suffered the consequences. So I must live with the fears because of my experiences.  At the mention of Putin s name, the thoughtful, elfin woman bristles.  I would like him to die, she says. Not only Putin but all the people giving the orders to start the shooting, to start wars. I want them all to die.  Amid the talk of invasion, it is easy to forget that Ukraine has been embroiled in conflict with its aggressive neighbour for eight years after Russian-backed separatists seized control of two self-styled republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. THIS was Putin s brutal response - along with the capture of Crimea - to pro-democracy protests that ousted his ally in the Ukrainian capital Kiev. The Kremlin s intervention has led to 14,000 deaths and 2.6‰million people such as Ekaterina forced from their homes. The war on Ukraine s eastern flank has been largely forgotten outside the country, while even inside, the problems confronting all these displaced people became known as the invisible crisis after they melted back into society. Yet if Putin unleashes a full-scale invasion, the impact would be highly visible and felt far beyond Ukraine. A major war would plunge the whole of Europe into crisis, said Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine s Minister of Defence.  The sudden appearance of between three and five million Ukrainian refugees fleeing a Russian invasion would be just one of many major concerns facing European society.  His view is echoed by Tom Tugendhat MP, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, who visited the country last week. We ve seen already many Ukrainians driven out of their homes in the east as well as Russia s allies in Belarus weaponising migrants against Nato states such as Poland and Lithuania, he said. We can only wonder with concern how many more people that Moscow is preparing to drive over the border into Europe.  There are an estimated 1.5‰million internally displaced Ukrainians in the nation of 44‰million, with others migrating to Russia or elsewhere in Europe. But aid groups believe the true figure is far higher as many people never registered with officials after settling with friends or relatives. Most remained in Russian-speaking eastern parts of Ukraine, such as Kharkiv - areas where there are fears Putin might use his Special Forces to try to trigger some kind of provocation as an excuse to send tanks over the border. Ekaterina s position perfectly illustrates the complexities of issues of identity and interwoven ties of communities in this snow-covered corner of eastern Europe. Born in Russia to a Ukrainian mother, she despaired of being constantly told at school about Russia s greatness when surrounded by poverty and corruption. After moving to Donetsk in her early teens, she declared herself Ukrainian. Yet she was forced to flee her new home with her mother and brother after pro-democracy protests led to the arrival of covert Russian troops. She then watched them operate and the subsequent explosion of conflict in her adopted Donetsk. Ekaterina recalls listening to radio reports of shooting and missiles at the airport, saying: I could not accept in my head that war was coming to my city. Most of her school and university friends have also left - except for one who now heads the Donetsk regime s youth party. She says: He is in charge of brainwashing children with propaganda, telling them lies that Putin is their ally. Like many displaced families, hers left with almost nothing. Even today, only one in eight of those who fled have permanent accommodation as they have struggled to rebuild lives after abandoning homes and jobs. Ekaterina said that, until recently, to dampen the pain of exile, she never talked about her life in Donetsk. Even now, she had to break off from our discussion to shed tears quietly in the toilet. Another woman said her husband was so disturbed after being tortured by separatists that he beat her, leading to divorce. A third said her daughter needed psychiatric help. There are an estimated 180,000 displaced people in Kharkiv, the former capital of Ukraine located only 30 miles from the Russian border. Little wonder that many are terrified by the Kremlin s military build-up so close to their new homes.  People who ran away from the war feel uneasy. They say, œwe lost Donetsk and Luhansk, we can t lose Kharkiv, said Eugenia Levinshtein, manager at Ukrainian Borders, a charity providing financial and psychological support for displaced citizens. She added: These are people who lost all their property - sometimes family members - and started life from scratch in a new city without any help from the state. It s very scary to think that the new lives they have created could be taken away again.  The charity is preparing for a fresh flow of traumatised people, with funds arriving from foreign partners to buy vehicles for emergency evacuation missions. We are getting ready for the worst-case scenario, Eugenia said. So is Alina Foklina, 38, as she mentally prepares a list of possessions to grab if forced to flee again with her daughter. Putin does not look a sane person, she said. I feel tense all the time - as if I want to curl up on the floor like a child.  Alina had to leave Stahanov, a town in the Luhansk region, after joining small pro-democracy protests with friends who waved Ukraine s blue and yellow flag near a statue of Lenin.  I wanted to keep the country united and become European - less corrupt, more open, she said. First, they faced jeers from pro-Russians, then threats and finally violence. Her friends were beaten in the streets, their cars were damaged. Her boyfriend was kidnapped and tortured in a basement. One man was shot dead in his garage. Alina left after the region held a widely discredited self-rule referendum. In our town, there was our small group of pro-Ukrainians, a slightly bigger group of pro-Russians - but most just wanted their lives to carry on with no warfare. It was heartbreaking to flee the town where she grew up, went to school and built a car-painting business - but she believed it would be for just a fortnight until the tensions cooled. We only had one suitcase with a few summer clothes.  She has never returned - having discovered that she had been sentenced to death for participating in protests. Nor has she spoken since to her father, a supporter of the separatists. For her, life in Kharkiv has been a struggle - relying on piecemeal work, moving apartments several times, unable to visit dying friends and seeing her teenage daughter suffer mental health problems that led to hospitalisation last year. Yet Alina has no regrets, despite telling me she sees only a fog when she thinks of the future. If I watch the news or see pictures of the Russian military equipment, it feels like my whole body is in a state of danger again, she said. Moscow denies its troops are in the breakaway Donbas republics, but one woman who witnessed the takeover from the inside is Olena Znatkova. As a senior local government official overseeing seven universities, she watched in dismay as colleagues fell for Putin s propaganda about the supposed Ukrainian threat . She said the beliefs of the pro-democracy protests resonated with her.  It was a wake-up call for me when people came on to the streets to try and change their lives, create more freedom and open up the country.  But most colleagues disagreed. She was ordered to ensure universities stopped such protests and did not fly their nation s flag. After being presented with a loyalty statement to the new republic, and knowing she would be deemed an enemy of the state for refusing to sign, Olena fled into hiding at her parents home. Their house was three miles from the Russian border, so she saw Kremlin tanks roll past - then decided to escape after the fighting intensified and debris from a downed Ukrainian aircraft landed on their property. It seemed there was fighting everywhere and everything was on fire, said Olena, 50.  I felt we could all die. So I said my goodbyes and left.  Taking no possessions except for her passport and nine-year-old daughter s birth certificate, the pair eventually reached Kharkiv. Since then, this civil servant - who once owned a three-bedroom home in Luhansk - has stayed at friends flats and university dormitories with her daughter, relying on donated clothes and eating student meals. Meanwhile, she has helped move 1,500 people and those seven Luhansk universities back into Ukraine, including about one-third of their academics and students. As she stocks up on coffee, tobacco and water in her office, steeling herself for another conflict, she tells me defiantly: After starting a new life here and moving all these people, I will not run away any more.  Rather than being afraid, she says: I feel angry, very angry. At first I was very emotional. But now I m emotionally drained.  Yet when I ask her about Putin, the reply of this gentle, middle-aged bureaucrat is the same as the one I heard from website creator Ekaterina Pereverzeva: I hope he dies.  Such words express the anguish of their silent suffering - along with the pain that their traumas are being stoked again by the sabre-rattling thug in the Kremlin.",Tabloid,1

The suggestion is he wants to ""drive a coach and horses"" through the 1951 Refugee Convention, a United Nations treaty which defines who a refugee is, lays out the responsibilties of nations that grant asylum and states who do not qualify as refugees. Of course this possible action has been met with screams of opposition, both from people like Refugee Council chief Enver Solomon and also some Home Office civil servants who are against the plans. There are major problems with Rishi's possible root and branch approach. One is that he said people who entered the country illegally and have been removed will have no right to re-entry. legal route for entry. Only Ukrainian refugees, Hong Kong objectors and Afghans who worked with the UK before the Taliban takeover have that possibility. And frankly, those fleeing Afghanistan are having a tough time getting out at the moment. One suggestion is that the Government should set up reception offices in foreign countries where asylum seekers could go to be processed to attempt legal entry. pt That might help stem the flood paying thousands to cross the Channel in small boats and systematise and check migrant entry.",Tabloid,0

The organisations, including the Red Cross and Save the Children, condemn the application process as a ""complex web"" causing ""great distress"" to refugees and frustration to tens of thousands of hosts. The Homes for Ukraine scheme expects those fleeing the war to find themselves a UK sponsor willing to house them before they can apply for a visa - unless they have relatives here and can use the family visa route. Desperate hopefuls must travel to a Visa Application Centre (VAC) to fill a detailed form. It is a 90-minute drive in Poland from the refugee reception centre to the British VAC and there is no public transport available. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council who helped draft the charities' open letter to the Government, said: ""We are increasingly concerned. People are having to struggle against a maze of red tape to try to get visas. Checks ""This is a humanitarian crisis and as a response you need something frictionless and simple. The current arrangement is too complicated. ""What we need is a simplified process with a straightforward application for a humanitarian visa. ""You could upload a copy of Ukrainian internal ID card or passport and then more fulsome security checks could be done on arrival in the UK. That was what happened when we evacuated thousands from Kabul last summer and it could easily be done again."" Mr Solomon accepted there were security concerns. The full text of the letter published in today's Times newspaper reads: ""A month after the conflict in Ukraine began, millions of mainly women and children have fled violence in desperate search of safety. Yet those who want to come to the UK are having to navigate a complex web of bureaucratic paperwork to get visas leaving them facing delays without any information about the status of their application. ""While it is welcome that our country is offering sanctuary, the visa process is causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians and increasing frustration to tens of thousands of Britons who want to welcome them into their homes. ""The Government must urgently review the use of visas and waive them as an immediate short-term measure, as has been done by the EU, and look to introduce a simplified emergency humanitarian visa process. ""It also needs to rethink the Nationality and Borders Bill to ensure all refugees fleeing conflict and persecution can be protected in the UK. ""Now is not the time to put paperwork and bureaucracy before the needs of people who have had their lives shattered by war or to weaken our commitment to refugee protection."" The letter is signed by Mr Solomon, Mike Adamson from the British Red Cross, Kirsty McNeill from Save the Children UK, Danny Sriskandarajah from Oxfam GB, and Laura Kyrke-Smith from the International Rescue Committee. It comes as research showed more than half of Britons think the Government should drop visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees. The poll, by Savanta ComRes, found 54 per cent back a no-visa policy, allowing unlimited numbers of Ukrainians to come. This comprotracted pares to just 21 per cent who said the requirements should stay.While 53 per cent believe Boris Johnson has a good overall approach to the war, only 42 per cent think so when it comes to refugees. The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows unlimited refugee places if they can find sponsors in England. The Welsh and Scottish Governments are acting as ""supersponsors"" - removing the need for applicants to find their own. Some 21,000 visas have been issued under the Ukraine family scheme, with 36,300 applications submitted. The Government said: ""We stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and the changes we've made to the visa process are making it quicker and simpler for Ukrainians to come here, as well as ensuring those already here can stay.""

She praises William's attention to detail and readiness to support everyone. ""He's either an adviser or surrogate godfather"", she said, noting how he gets to know every member of the Earthshot family. He connects them with potential funders, advisers and mentors to help find solutions, she added. ""It's almost as if he's becoming their personal champion, and trust me, he knows each one of them and their work really well."" Earthshot is ramping up plans to take the organisation global with Ms Jones now in Kuala Lumpur looking at new links. This year's prizegiving is set to be in a different part of the world.The inaugural awards took place in London and last year's were in Boston.The next location will be announced imminently.

The charity said two of the cars were armoured, while the third had a ""soft skin"". It said their route had been cleared and coordinated with the Israel Defence Forces. The first car is understood to have been struck on Gaza's coastal road, the Al Rashid, after leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought by ship. The second vehicle was then hit 800 metres to the south and the third roughly one mile southwest from the first car. This is believed to have been the unarmoured vehicle as it sustained the most damage, the rear completely destroyed, the metal twisted and windows blown out by the force of the missile strike. Some of those travelling in the first car tried to get into a second, which was then also hit. A third car approached the stricken second vehicle and the wounded were being ferried into it before that too was hit by a missile, security sources told Israeli media. All three cars were struck in a ""deconflicted zone"". The WCK confirmed it was pausing all operations in the war-torn enclave. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said the operation to recover the seven bodies took ""several hours"". A spokesperson said: ""In a challenging operation, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society recovered the bodies of the seven World Central Kitchen employees. ""They were targeted by Israeli occupation forces yesterday evening while travelling in vehicles owned by the kitchen in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. ""Two bodies were initially missing but later located and retrieved. All seven were transported to theAl-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Weapon ""Later they were taken to Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital in preparation for evacuation."" WCK chief executive Erin Gore said: ""This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organisations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable. I am heartbroken and appalled that we and the world lost beautiful lives because of a targeted attack by the IDF.""

The Prime Minister said he would set out its ""obvious merits"" to Charles, 73, at the Commonwealth summit in the capital, Kigali. Mr Johnson hit out at ""condescending"" opponents of the plans to deport illegal migrants to the East African nation and vowed to defend the policy when Charles hosted him for tea and talks. Speaking at a school in Kigali yesterday, he said: ""People need to keep an open mind about the policy, the critics need to keep an open mind about the policy. ""A lot of people can see its obvious merits. So yeah, of course, if I am seeing the prince tomorrow, I am going to be making that point."" The policy, part of a £120million economic deal with Rwanda, has also been criticised because of concerns about the country's human rights record. However, Mr Johnson is not planning to visit the Kigali hostel, right, where migrants will be housed. And the PM said yesterday even Ukrainian refugees fleeing war could also be sent to Rwanda if they arrived in the UK illegally. He said: ""I think we are giving 130,000 visas to Ukrainians and they have at least two very good routes for coming to this country. ""But if you come here illegally, you're undermining all those who come here legally.And it's crazy. So I'm afraid the answer is, I suppose, yes, in theory that could happen, but I think it's unlikely."" Before the serious talks began Prince Charles yesterday took the opportunity to adopt an injured crane which cannot fly, joking: ""No flies on me!"" Cth a w NTh b sp The wildlife-loving prince was given a certificate for the bird, called Mutesi - meaning spoilt because it is so well looked after and prefers the company of humans - at Kigali wildlife sanctuary Umusambi Village. At a butterfly centre, Charles was shown two of the insects and told: ""They are mating."" The unflustered prince said: ""Then we had better leave them to it."" Charles is expected to tell the 54-nation Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting today that they can use their ""great strength"" to ""speak up for the values which bind us, to invest in a rapid transition to a sustainable future and to create opportunities for our young people"". And the Duchess of Cornwall invoked the Queen yesterday, as she urged Commonwealth nations to use their power to end violence against women. At a meeting in Kigali attended by Rwanda's first lady, Jeannette Kagame, and Mr Johnson's wife Carrie, 34, Camilla said they should take inspiration from both a landmark speech by the Queen 75 years ago and her faith in their ability to create a better world. The future Queen Consort, 74, who has championed domestic abuse charities, said: ""There is power in this alliance. ""Whether we are aware of it or not, we all know someone who has endured sexual or domestic abuse.We can, therefore, all be part of combating these heinous acts.""

292,urc_dailyexpress_raw.docx,Daily Express,5/3/2022,643 words,Macer Hall,Truss tightens squeeze on Putin's cronies,"LIZ Truss has unveiled new economic measures to tighten the squeeze on Russian despot Vladimir Putin and his sidekicks. And as international talks about sanctions intensified, Dominic Raab backed calls for Ukrainian refugees in the UK to be housed in mansions seized from Russian oligarchs. He also said new legislation would stop them abusing British libel laws to silence critics here. Ms Truss last night put forward amendments to a Bill designed to accelerate restrictions on Kremlinlinked businesses. The Foreign Secretary said: ""The changes will allow us to go faster and harder on those closest to Putin, including oligarchs, as we ratchet pressure in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression."" One proposed change will allow the UK to swiftly coordinate with the EU to take punitive action. Another would shorten the deadline for overseas companies to register their beneficial owners from 18 months to six months. Officials say the measure will crack down on money laundering through UK property while giving people who hold real estate in overseas entities for legitimate reasons time to comply with the new rules. A further amendment will also increase criminal penalties for noncompliance from fines of up to £500 per day to up to £2,500 per day. PM Boris Johnson said: ""The UK has led the way with the toughest package of sanctions against Putin's regime and we're bolstering this with new powers. ""We will ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil and close the net on corruption. They will have nowhere to hide."" But Labour last night said the latest measures were long overdue. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said: ""It is totally unacceptable that Putin-linked oligarchs who should have already faced sanctions are allowed to move money because of Government incompetence. ""Ministers should have introduced the laws needed to work in lock-step with our allies months ago, not be left sanctioning hundreds fewer individuals and entities than the EU and the US. ""We must act against these individuals in days, not months."" Ms Truss also urged Nato allies to do more to restrict Russian oil and gas exports and increase pressure on Putin's murderous regime. At a meeting in Brussels, the Foreign Secretary said more sanctions were needed to cripple Putin's economy. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""nothing is off the table"" in terms of energy sanctions. But he added that it was not in the US interest to cut the global supply as this would send the price of oil surging. Instead, ""we have a strong interest in degrading Russian energy,"" and reducing dependence on Russian energy in the long term, Mr Blinken said. Earlier, Mr Rabb indicated his support for using property grabbed under sanctions to be used to shelter Ukrainian families who have fled the invasion. His Cabinet colleague Michael Gove is reported to have argued in favour of the idea within the Government while the Lib Dems have publicly called for the proposal to be implemented. Asked on LBC whether the Government could seize property owned by Russian oligarchs, Mr Raab said: ""If we've got the evidence and the legal basis, then we'll do it."" And the Deputy PM said he would prevent Russians linked to the evil Kremlin regime from exploiting the British justice system to silence those investigating corruption in Putin's rotten regime. The Cabinet minister told BBC Breakfast: ""We have seen oligarchs and kleptocrats and those with links to Putin coming into this country and suing under our libel laws against those who are shining a light on corruption and abuse. ""I'm going to be putting forward proposals to prevent that."" But Mr Raab refused to be drawn on why Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had not been sanctioned as he prepares to sell the club. He said: ""We do not want to give advance sight to anyone of the measures that we take."" Graphic   Further and faster...Liz Truss",Tabloid,1
300,urc_dailyexpress_raw.docx,Daily Express,15/4/2022,747 words,Ross Clark,Rejecting Rwanda deal only aids evil people smugglers,"RWANDA, in modern times, has been better known as a place which people flee from rather than to. The country's civil war between 1990 and 1994 ended with one of the worst cases of genocide in recorded history. It is little wonder, then, that the Government's proposal to process asylum applications in Rwanda has raised eyebrows. Predictably, there has been a horrified reaction from the Conservatives' political opponents and from migrant advocacy groups who always attack any government policy which falls short of opening Britain's doors to anyone and everyone. Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford called the plan ""cruel and inhumane"". The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called it ""chilling"" and ""evil"".The Refugee Council claimed that it ""violated"" the principle of the UN Convention. The Government says it accepts there will be legal challenges and will not begin the scheme until they have been heard. B UT what if the plan to use Rwanda to process some asylum applications were actually to achieve what it sets out to do: to end people smuggling across the Channel while making the asylum system function better for those genuinely in need? The real evil is charging wideeyed people thousands of pounds to cross from France to Britain (from one safe country to another) and then putting them in an unseaworthy rubber dinghy with 60 other people - with the inevitable drownings which result. Anything which promises to put an end to that should at least be given fair consideration. Britain has a long and proud history of helping those fleeing from danger, and it goes without saying that this must continue. In some ways, it is true, recent policy towards asylumseekers and other migrants has been a disgrace. How ridiculous, for example, that UK homeowners ready and willing to put up Ukrainian refugees have been blocked by bureaucracy. In at least one case a couple have complained that they have been rejected on the grounds their house has bare floorboards rather than carpets. Before that, there was the scandal which saw the Home Office try to eject members of the Windrush generation who came to Britain legally and have lived here for decades, raising children here and following careers here. The idea that the Home Office, or any other government department or agency, should seek to create a ""hostile environment"" is pretty horrible. So, yes, there will be legitimate concerns as to how the Rwanda scheme will be conducted.There is also the issue of cost. It will not be cheap flying large numbers of people to Rwanda, although this will have to be set against the far lower living costs in that country. But to dismiss the plan out of hand or to claim it is some kind of evil scheme to dump refugees on an unsuspecting African country is wrong. It is insulting both to the Home Secretary, herself the daughter of refugees, and to the government of Rwanda which has negotiated with the UK government with its eyes open. The fact that the scheme could put £120million into the Rwandan economy is something to celebrate. The Government needs to change current asylum policy somehow because it is not working. It is quite plain that in amongst the genuine refugees arriving in Britain are large numbers of economic migrants attracted by the promise of a better life. Genuine flows of refugees are made up of men, women of all ages, as well as children. As becomes clear when a boat-load of migrants is landed in Kent, however, cross- Channel traffic is overwhelmingly made up of young men. E VERY single person who abuses the asylum system by making a claim when they are not in danger puts pressure on the system, making it more difficult for genuine refugees to get help. The current system is also failing to protect Britain from terrorism and criminal activity. It is a sad fact that a small number of those using the asylum system are coming here to try to do us harm. Among them was Emad Al Swealmeen, who detonated a bomb in Liverpool last November, fortunately killing no one but himself. If a Rwandan processing centre can help prevent a repeat of cases such as that, defeat people-traffickers and discourage economic migrants from abusing the system, it will have performed a vital function. To dismiss out of hand the idea of setting up a processing centre in Rwanda is a knee-jerk reaction to a policy which, if handled well, could help to make the asylum system work better for those in real need.

WHEN something like Ukraine happens it's easy to feel there's nothing you can do as an individual to make a difference. Or very little, anyway. After all, what can one person really achieve in the face of huge, horrifying world events? Images of bombed-out homes, abandoned cars, refugees and hungry, cold families have haunted me since Russian forces moved across the border on February 24. Like many Britons, I've found myself not being able to sleep or, finally dropping off and then waking up crying - worrying constantly about this unfolding tragedy and its consequences for millions of innocent people. It's like watching a slow-motion car crash in vivid colour in scenes reminiscent of the Second World War but taking place in 21st-century Europe. A week or so ago, I woke up in desperation thinking, ""What can I do to help?"" So I went to my local Costco to buy supplies - mainly over-the-counter children's medicine, sanitary products, nappies and the like. At the checkout, I was stopped from buying Calpol - there are limits on how much you're allowed - but people on both sides of me in the queue offered to take it through and then refused my money. I was so touched by the kindness of strangers I made a short video which went viral. I was very emotional, I'm not ashamed to admit, but these were people at their best. The response was amazing. I woke up a day later and it had been viewed 30,000 times. I thought there must've been some mistake but there wasn't. As a result, I was contacted by people assisting an incredible organisation, Help From Bournemouth To Ukraine, that has been sending humanitarian supplies across Europe as the refugee crisis grows. It was only set up a fortnight ago by Karol Swiacki - a local Polish shop owner who originally asked for donations from the Polish community. Already, it's making an incredible difference, collecting tons of supplies and dispatching them on the 1,200-mile journey to the Ukrainian border. Karol, 40, said: ""I'm getting direct requests for urgent aid.We're speaking to a children's home at the moment that needs lots of bottles, formula and blankets and that's where we can help. Every pound, every hour, every donation really does make a huge difference to the lives of those that have been torn apart by this awful war."" I ended up buying 300 survival blankets on Amazon. Karol has got an amazing operation.They've been offered warehousing and have more than 100 volunteers. But they don't have enough transport. I've got a VW Transporter van so I thought I'd go to Bournemouth and see things in action. But once they told me about the transport issues, I knew I had to make the journey myself. There are people out there who, quite cynically, say if you donate things, they either end up on the black market dumped by the roadside or rotting in a warehouse. I doubted this was true, but I wanted to see with my own eyes, to be able to tell people what is happening and reassure them their kindness is getting to where it's needed most. It's direct action at its very finest. My wife Kirsty wanted to come with me to share the driving. But I would be coming within 12 miles of the border close to where Russian missiles hit a training base near Lviv on Sunday. It's a warzone (it will definitely invalidate my travel insurance!). If something went wrong, or I got into a pickle, that is one thing. But if Kirsty was with me, it's a whole different story.We made the difficult decision that she should stay at home with our son, 14, and daughter, 12. Talk about an eleventh-hour plan! The temptation to set off and just drive is enormous, but without knowing where to go you risk wasting time and effort without actually helping. Karol's group knows people on the ground who need stuff and now have contacts at the refugee centres. It costs them around £3,000 for every round-trip. When they realised I had a small private van, they decided to entrust me with valuable medical supplies and other bits and pieces that might get lost travelling by truck. I've carried, I suspect, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of medical kit: saline drips, defibrillators, heart monitors, foetal monitors, surgical equipment - quite literally life-savers. I booked the ferry and Help From BournemouthTo Ukraine sorted some of the paperwork and I set out for Dover on Saturday: one man, one van and one mission with a selection of wine gums - I have been rationing myself to one every 50 miles - and an assortment of energy drinks to keep me going. I travelled from Dover to Calais on Saturday and drove through France, Belgium and The Netherlands, stopping overnight in Eindhoven. On Sunday, I covered 850 miles - it was utterly exhausting, a total killer - and yesterday afternoon, having travelled from Krakow, Poland, I rendezvoused with Karol's contacts in Medyka near the Polish- Ukrainian border.The journey is 1,260 miles according to Google, which says it takes 23 hours - that doesn't include sleeping, going to the toilet or filling up. You hear Western aid is being viewed by Putin as a hostile act.Was I, in my bright red VW van, at risk? Who knows? I hoped not, but I had to do it. There have been one or two horrible trolls who suggested I'm doing this because I'm a celebrity as some sort of publicity stunt. It's not and I'm not going to let a few keyboard warriors stand in the way of my helping. I'm doing this not as a celeb but as a man with a van. Those few comments aside, people have been incredibly supportive. Handing over the equipment last night was incredibly emotional, probably not helped by the fact I've hardly slept for 48 hours. The courage of volunteers moving supplies across the border into a war zone is truly humbling. I can now confirm that those donations, from Gladys in Bournemouth or Paul in Wolverhampton, ended up in the hands of the people who most need them. I've seen it with my own eyes. And you know what, it turns out one individual, albeit with the help of a hundred or so others, really can make a difference after all.

And the families involved have thanked the kind-hearted British people who have put them up and helped them live normal lives after fleeing Vladimir Putin's deadly invasion. More than 150 refugees attended the children's Christmas party at the weekend - and pleaded for more sponsors to help their compatriots. One, Alina Kusyi, 40, praised those who have already helped. The primary school teacher said: ""Thank God there are good people in the world."" The refugees opened up to the Mirror about their death-defying escapes from Ukraine. And told how the Homes for Ukraine scheme rescued them. But they also warned a shortage of rental homes is leaving many struggling to find places to live here. There are Ukrainian nuclear scientists and doctors who are now labouring in factories, an opera singer packing bulbs and a lawyer cleaning. Real estate agent Dimitry Panasenko, 36, who helped organise the party in Rauceby Hall near Sleaford, Lincs, told of his ""horror"" escape from Kharkiv. He had been visiting friends with his two-year-old son Ilay while his wife Maria was in Qatar working as a DJ. Dimitry said: ""We woke up and war had started. I saw a rocket flying past my window and destroy a nine-floor building, which collapsed. ""It was a horror story from then on. We spent 10 days in an underground car park. Making food for the children was hard. Every time we had to go above ground to get food we were risking our lives with explosions every minute. ""I had to try to get my son to safety. I have a white car and we used black duck tape to make giant signs saying 'Kids here. Please don't shoot.' ""That day they blew up the government house and we were 600 metres away. Our car ended up red with blood and body parts from the explosion. ""I put my foot down and drove 120mph down the main street."" Miraculously Dimitry and his three passengers escaped alive, arriving at the Polish border. A soldier realised he was alone with his son and waved him through to safety. He flew to join his wife Maria and waited for their UK visas to arrive after a senior midwife from Leicester Hospital said she would sponsor them. Maria added: ""This woman saved our lives, she is amazing. We stayed with her for eight months and they are like our second family."" The couple have a rented home and Dimitry works as a fibre installer. Maria said: ""The UK is doing the best for refugees for sure, they have the same rights as UK citizens. I hear about other countries and it's very different."" Two weeks ago, Alina, who is Dimitry's ex-wife arrived in the UK with her two children Sonya, 15, and Tysha, five - the eldest is his. She had fled war for the second time, first in Ukraine then Israel. Alina was sponsored by an 82-year-old former lawyer. She said: ""My husband is Jewish so when war broke out in Ukraine we went to Israel. ""A year and a half later we had settled in and it was feeling like home. It took a long time for us to recover. ""But then it happened again. I could not understand it, I was shocked. ""I could hear automatic gunfire and it gave me flashbacks to Ukraine. I just knew I had to leave again. ""I got a call from the Ukrainian consulate and told there was a flight for Ukrainians and it was the last one on October 19th. If I'm ready I could go. ""It was a very hard decision as I had only five hours to prepare for the flights and say goodbye to my husband. He is still waiting for a visa to come to the UK. Now I have to start all over again but I finally feel safe again."" Jonny Hoare, 59, owns Rauceby Hall and took in eight refugees himself. He hosted the Christmas party. The first Ukrainians he looked after were Maria Avvokomov and her son Boris, who was just about to turn 18. He said: ""Boris is now at Lincoln university and I'm like his surrogate dad. It makes me tingly to think about him doing his four-year degree in maths."" Jonny, who set up Host They Ukrainian Re fugees Lincolnshire Network said there are still many refugees looking for UK homes. He added: ""It's not getting any NINS better. Because of the rental shortage there's a lot of people who have been with a host for longer than a year. ""What there is available tends to be ridiculously expensive, so it's hard for Ukrainians to be able to afford it. ""It can be quite demanding looking after a family but being involved with Boris and Maria was amazing. ""There are frustrations, Maria was a railway engineer and the best she could find was cleaning in Iceland."" Karen Marlor, 60, from Grantham, a Ukrainian support worker, has also hosted refugees.

When asked how our health, education and housing will be able to cope with the instant influx of people, Mr Martin said: ""The bottom line is this is an exceptional humanitarian crisis brought about by war."" Meanwhile, The Department of Education is now conducting a nationwide audit of schools across the country to examine the availability of places for Ukrainian children. This data will then be crossexamined with housing capacity to determine where the State will accommodate the thousands of refugees expected here.

Then again, who knew that taking in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and 22,400 asylum seekers in the middle of a housing crisis was not a great idea... apart from the Irish public? Twelve months on it has finally dawned on the Government that the country can't take in any more with the Taoiseach now issuing a similar message. This week the Cabinet was told the current approach to accommodating those claiming to be fleeing wars and persecution is unsustainable. This was as obvious last year as it is today but in an attempt to be the best boy in Europe the Government refused to set limits on the number of refugees and vilified those who called for such measures. Exactly a year ago this week this column pointed out it would soon be impossible to continue to accommodate increasing numbers of people in the midst of an acute housing and homelessness crisis. There was also much consternation among politicians and radio and TV panellists at the time when #irelandisfull began trending on Twitter. Members of the public who voiced their concerns about the growing asylum seeker crisis were branded right wing for largely pointing out what the Taoiseach said this week. Leo Varadkar told the Dail there is a limit to Ireland's capacity to provide for asylum seekers and refugees, adding: ""We're very much at that currently."" The hundreds sleeping in tents in a muddy field in an Irish winter might argue the limit was reached a long time ago. But like many of this Coalition's disastrous policies, this crisis is of the Government's own making. Its willingness to blow taxpayers' money far and above what any other EU state spends is what has brought about this unsustainable situation. The reality is Ireland is a soft touch when it comes to refugees and asylum seekers and it's not entirely the fault of those who might abuse the system. Indeed in the recent Budget it emerged the State is to spend tens of millions more on asylum seekers next year than was allocated to the country's defence forces. Another (EURO)2.5billion has been put aside for Ukrainian refugees who currently receive (EURO)220 a week - the highest amount paid in the EU. This is the same sum given to an Irish person on disability benefit which, unlike the payment the Ukrainians receive, is means tested. The Taoiseach admitted there are a lot of ""secondary movements"" to Ireland which means that Ukrainians who moved to other parts of the EU are opting to come because of free accommodation and the generous social welfare payment. Meanwhile, the amount the Czech Republic pays to such refugees is (EURO)42 while the richest country in the EU, Germany, makes a payment of (EURO)112, just over half of what they receive here. ""It's a long-standing issue with international protection,"" Mr Varadkar said but it's one that his government has created. He acknowledged that people who have been living safely in other parts of western Europe for a period of time are now coming to Ireland to claim asylum. When you can arrive here without any travel or identification to prove you came from a war zone or are escaping persecution, who can blame them? When someone is allowed to remain in the country even if they are issued with a deportation order is it any wonder Ireland is such an attractive destination for those chancing their arm? In what was a classic case of closing the gate after the horse has bolted, the Taoiseach said that to prevent what is in effect welfare tourism the Government has to ""review the situation"". The bigger question is why, despite all the warnings, are the Taoiseach and the Cabinet only now addressing what is one of the most divisive issues of the past decade? The Government was warned in the spring of last year that Russia's attempted invasion of Ukraine was going to develop into a full-scale war that could last many years. It has been pointed out by many experts that uncontrolled migration would put serious strains on the country's already stretched resources which could lead to public unrest. It's already started to degrade the tourism sector but, more importantly, it has begun to erode the social cohesion that has made Ireland the safe and stable country that it is. It is somewhat ironic that the real reason for the growing concern among politicians is not out of concern for the country's citizens or refugees. It is the growing realisation that immigration will be the major issue in the fast-approaching General Election that has finally made them take action.

The figure is expected to rise to 107,000 by the end of June 2023, according to a study conducted by Women in AI Ireland's WaiPRACTICE programme. The data focused on the influx of refugees to Ireland since the turn of the century and created a machine-learning model capable of predicting future numbers.

Researchers found that 61,000 Ukrainians had been allocated Personal Public Service Numbers by the end of November this year. Based on historical trends, the researchers' model predicts if the war continues another 30,000 Ukrainians will arrive in Ireland by the middle of March, with a further 17,000 arriving between March and the end of June. This would bring the number of new arrivals from Ukraine in the first six months of 2023 to 46,000, adding up to a total of 107,000.

That's the incredible figure spent on paying for the pets of Ukrainian refugees to be accommodated, the Irish Mirror revealed this week. One million euro a month for what is evidently an extravagance, not a need. Not only paid out for cats and dogs being brought over from homes in Ukraine, but also those acquired after refugees arrived here. It's being defended politically as a virtue, but in any reasonable view, it's more of a vice. The public aren't fools, our leaders should know that by now. They should also know this kind of thing is antagonistic and irresponsible at a time of a widening wealth gap. It's a desperate squandering of other people's money that could have been better spent in countless other areas, including housing homeless asylum seekers instead of leaving them in tents in the city. True benevolence is about giving appropriately. We cannot afford this. But the Government has forgotten the value of money, with Micheal Martin piously claiming it ""reflects the best of who we are"".

But it was your hard-earned taxes that paid for it. There should be an inquiry into this level of flagrant overspend by the state, with citizens' money. How was this allowed to happen? Who signed off on it? Was it a case of being afraid to say No? Why not just tell people arriving from a warzone, fine, you can keep Fido, but you're going to have to pay for him yourself ?

Kateryna said: ""We slept in the train terminal in Lviv like horses in a stable last night. We wanted to get a train out, but it was too busy. ""Everyone was pushing and shoving and fighting to get on them. It was crazy."" They travelled by bus instead, but had to walk the last 12-and-a-half miles through hail and snow.

Ireland may have its problems (I would have said) but the one thing we've always been pretty good at is spotting an out-and-out chancer. Laughably obvious shysters like Trump and Bojo wouldn't even get out of the starting gate here. Sure, we've had chancers at the very top in the past - leaders who displayed a creative approach to building personal wealth and a very loose regard for the rules the rest of us have to live by. But they were pretty good at hiding that side, while making sure to actually apply themselves to running the country and the economy at the same time. We've never had anything like Trump or Boris inflicted on us - but we've now seen the damage they can do. Boris famously didn't give a flying feck about Brexit one way or another until he realised it could be his path to power. On the morning the English and Welsh actually voted to shoot themselves in the foot, he looked as shocked and as shaken as anybody else, realising the once-in-a-century mess he'd talked the country into. It's been a bad few days for the both of them - even if Trump still refuses to deal with reality and millions of the gullible Yanks who fell for his snake-oil salesman act would vote for him again tomorrow. So could we see that kind of character here? The short answer, if the last 12 months are anything to go by, is yes, we bloody could. There are enough Irish people who can only deal with simple answers - like it's Ukrainian refugees and not greed, corruption and shameful mismanagement behind the housing emergency. Or that hardworking Polish plasterers or Filipino nurses are somehow less deserving of being in Ireland than the rent-a-mob anti-immigrant ""protesters"" who have loads of free time on their hands to make a racket. Funny that, you'd think these ""patriots"" would be busy working and paying their taxes. There's a lot of anger out there. In many ways, it's understandable, we live in a country where the game is rigged against working people, where the already-haves will always be first in the queue for everything and where basic public services are expensive and usually not fit for purpose. All it would take is one charismatic chancer to tap into that anger and frustration, that sense of injustice, and we could be looking at our own Trump or Johnson, even if our PR-voting system gives us some protection against just such an outcome. We can't take our relatively sane (if incredibly frustrating) politics for granted. Millions of people fell for Trump and Boris. Millions still - against all reason - would vote for them tomorrow. It could happen here in Ireland - we must make sure it does not. Graphic   PLEASE NO Boris and Trump",Tabloid,0

The People Before Profit TD used Dail privilege to claim the recent spate of arson attacks on professed accommodation sites are ""acts of far-right terrorism in the State"". Mr Murphy told the chamber he was not suggesting any of the three had ""possible involvement in nefarious activity"", but he argued there had been a ""clear pattern"" with recent fires. He was speaking just 24 hours after an old dormer bungalow in Leixlip that had been incorrectly linked to asylum accommodation was burned down. Mr Murphy accused the Government of not taking enough action to hold those responsible to account. He told the Dail: ""The pattern is very, very clear. A rumour starts, true or false, suggesting a property is going to be used. Far-right activists, people like Philip Dwyer, Gavin Pepper, Fergus Power, are quick to the scene. ""A few days later, it is burned down. We should call what we are seeing what it is. We are witnessing a campaign of far-right terrorism in this State. ""What has been the response? Almost nothing. Nobody charged. Fiddling while the country burns. We finally have three arrests this morning for the arson in Ringsend.""

Ceann Comhai rle Sean O Fearghail warned Mr Murphy he had named individuals ""who are frequently named in the public media"" and ""that is fine"". But he urged the Deputy to be careful, stating he had named the men ""more or less in the context of suggesting possible involvement in the nefarious activity. In other words, the burning down of buildings. That's not in order if that's what you are suggesting. ""It's open to that conclusion, just be very careful please"". Mr Murphy said he was not suggesting those people were directly involved and argued that he was pointing out a ""pattern"". BLAME In response, Finance Minister Michael McGrath, who was filling in for Tanaiste Micheal Martin during Leaders' Questions, branded Mr Murphy's contribution outrageous and told him that ""only you could come into the house and seek to blame the Government for people burning down buildings"". He added: ""You've actually made the work of the gardai more difficult and the work of our criminal justice system to secure successful prosecutions for people who are conducting criminal acts. I don't think you've done anyone any service with the contribution that you've just made."" Meanwhile, speaking on Newstalk's Pat Kenny Show, the Taoiseach stated he believed arson attacks on locations linked to asylum accommodation could be characterised as hate crimes which would mean, he warned, ""stiffer sentences"". Leo Varadkar said: ""These are serious crimes and they are also motivated by hate. Let's not forget that. ""People often ask, what is hate crime? How do you legislate for hate? ""Somebody who is burning a building because they believe that people of a different nationality or a different colour are going to be accommodated there, that's a very clear hate crime to me. ""Those who encourage it or spread disinformation knowing full well that this could be a consequence of it, that is a hate crime. ""Potentially [offenders] will get an additional stiffer sentence because of the hate element of this."" Mr Varadkar also stated it is not believed that the recent spate of arson attacks are all being carried out by the same people. He said all of the fires have been ""different in nature"" and added: ""There are some that are doing it opportunistically, others who are connected to extreme right racist views who are more organised in what they're doing. ""The attacks have been different. Take somewhere like Crooksling, the nursing home in Brittas. I would know that well from my time working as a doctor in Tallaght. It is where we would have sent patients. ""That was a big building. To burn that down took a lot of planning and took a degree of knowledge. ""In other places, it hasn't been arson on that scale.""

The refugee students aged 15 to 21, like the lions, were saved from Russian warmonger Vladimir Putin's rockets. Listening to the beasts at Yorkshire Wildlife Park, Yelizoete Terletsko, 18, said: ""I was really upset they had to leave our home in Ukraine, the same as me. But I'm really grateful that people helped them like they did me and we are all in a safe place now."" Later she squealed in delight as a giraffe grabbed a branch from her and said: ""They're so strong."" Yelizoete recalled her sister phoning her to say the war had started. The school for the blind in the northern city of Kharkiv was one of the first buildings to be bombed. The students, many of whom are orphans, were evacuated to Poland a day before it was virtually destroyed. Yelizoete said: ""I thought 'how can there be war in the 21st century? How can that happen? When the bombing began I was worried I wouldn't survive. ""Because we're blind we can hear differently. You can hear more and you feel the noises in your body. Rats ""It was a horrible experience and I hope it all finishes soon because I never want to hear the bombs again."" Initially, the 70-year-old headmaster decided everyone should hide in the school's basement, with staff securing the school's windows with mattresses to protect against rocket attacks. The students were traumatised by both the rats in the basement, and the rocket attacks outside. Deputy head teacher Marzena Bialas said: ""They're really excited about the lions in Yorkshire. They didn't know they had been shipped over to the UK. When we told them about it they googled the Mirror. They also phoned their old head teacher to tell him they were visiting lions from Ukraine."" The head teacher from the Polish school, Violetta Trzcina, said the 14 students had now been with them for two years. She said: ""We can't thank everyone enough for this trip as it is helping not only kids but blind adults to forget about the tragic situation in Ukraine."" The students have been supported by the Duchess of York, who helped to arrange the wildlife visit and the Thomas Pocklington Trust and the RNIB who funded their trip to the UK. Sarah, Duchess of York told the Mirror she had met the students a number of times and it was ""wonderful"" they'd been able to visit Yorkshire. She said: ""I hope the visit brings smiles to their faces - for me the smile of a child has always been the most important thing. ""They have been through unimagi- n a b l e trauma, separated from their families, broken apart by the dreadful Russian invasion. It is just the most appalling situation. ""I first met the group in Poland at the onset of the war, where my charity has worked for many years. I was humbled to hear their story of survival and determination, and we have remained in touch ever since. It is an honour for me to call them my friends."" The group were also taken behind the scenes at the Park, near Doncaster, and listened to some of the ""most vocal mammals on the planet"", the sea lions. Then they had a private audience in the lion enclosure where Aysa and her three cubs, Santa, Emi and Teddi, are settling in. The big cats roared as the youngsters were told about their journey by the ranger. The small pride arrived last week thanks to help from the park's Wildlife Foundation who funded the trip. Pregnant Aysa was first moved from a private zoo in Donetsk, Ukraine, to the country's capital Kyiv. She gave birth to the cubs there, and the family went to Poznan in Poland, where they were safe but unable to see the sky for nine months. After crossing six countries and travelling more than 2,000 miles they finally arrived at their safe haven in Auckley last Thursday. Within days, they had settled so much, the rangers felt able to remove the steel panel between their mum's pen and theirs so they are now separated by see-through mesh. The rangers say all have been head rubbing and ""showing really positive signs"", with Emi lying next to her mum by the mesh all day long. As we watch, Emi won't leave the mesh, and appears to be trying to touch her mum with her paw resting in the space between the pens. HORRIBLE The rangers are planning to let them have access into an area which overlooks their huge eight acre enclosure, where they will live eventually. As they roared at the visitors, Bohdan Ustiianskyi, 18, told us: ""I feel emotional that I can be here. I never dreamed I would travel so much. ""It was a big surprise to find out about the lions from Ukraine, it's similar to our story."" He told how he woke to hear shouting about the war starting and a tank parked outside their school. They did not know if it was Ukrainian or Russian. He said: ""It was horrible. It was an old building and the walls were shaking, the bombing was so close to us in the centre of Kharkiv. ""We stayed in the basement only going upstairs to brush our teeth. I was scared. We didn't understand what was going on because we could not see it.

Ireland. seen as touch seeking better The country's already-overcrowded main airport being turned into a makeshift refugee reception centre did not come about by accident. It was designed by the coalition of chaos that masquerades as a Government. Any of the 10,325 indigenous homeless could have told the Taoiseach and his ministers what would happen if you invited around 40,000 Ukrainian refugees into the country and failed to stop thousands more coming here who originally planned to seek asylum in Britain. The end result is total chaos resulting in the opening of what is set to be a tent city at Gormanston military camp in Co Meath. Ironically, the former Air Corps base is just a stone's throw from Mosney where hundreds of would-be asylum seekers have been living in Direct Provision accommodation for years. The disclosure that 70% of those at Citywest, which was designed as a reception centre for Ukrainians fleeing war, are international protection applicants, has also come as a shock. In some circles this is a polite way of saying these are migrants who previously preferred to go to the UK but now see Ireland as a better option than Rwanda. At the same time that those fleeing the war in Ukraine were sleeping on the floors of the old Dublin airport terminal building it emerged Irish patients on chronic hospital waiting lists are flying to Spain for treatment.

Again, any of the 830,000 people on hospital waiting lists in this country could have told the Taoiseach and his ministers it was not feasible to take in tens of thousands of refugees when the State can't provide hospital treatment for those already in the country. Earlier this week Galway Deputy Catherine Connolly told the Dail that one of her elderly constituents who is almost blind languished on a hospital trolley for seven days before receiving treatment. An Irish Government trying to be the best boy in Europe has had dreadful consequences for this country in the past - we shouldered 42% of EU bank debt - and it would appear that the mistakes of the past are being repeated. What the Government is doing is the equivalent of a dad promising to bring his kids to the North Pole for Christmas only to take them to buy a frozen turkey in an Iceland store. It is a simple fact of life that a country with an already chronic housing shortage and a dysfunctional health service cannot possibly provide for the needs of what could end up being up to 100,000 refugees. While this country has been praised for opening its doors to Ukrainian people fleeing Russia's brutal attack on their country there are limits to the amount of help that can be given. Across the water the UK, which has a population of 67 million, has only accepted around 66,000 refugees. While as of yesterday this country with a population of just over five million has taken in almost 41,000 and that number is growing by the day. On the other hand Scotland, which has a similar population to this country with a decent health service, has only accepted less than 7,300. While most Irish people have sympathy for the people of the Ukraine and until now have been happy enough with the Government's response to dealing with the influx of refugees. The disclosure in recent weeks that 93% of the private accommodation promised at the start of the Russian invasion never materialised could indicate that the public are becoming less tolerant to the plight of those fleeing the conflict. Because of Ireland's openness to helping Ukrainians there is a growing feeling that Ireland is now seen as a soft touch for those who may be those seeking a better life rather than those seeking protection. In light of Britain's decision to send asylum seekers to be processed in Rwanda they are probably right. Ireland is now seen as a soft touch for those seeking a better life",Tabloid,1

625,urc_dailymirror_raw1.docx,Daily Mirror,24/8/2023,1006 words,NA,My body began to shake and my eyes filled up as soon as I heard the explosions; DIANITA'S STORY... 18MTHS AFTER START OF Ukraine WAR »» Irish not about a fight for freedom..it's inspiring »» Everyone's lives are now divided into before & after,"Today marks 18 months since Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, thousands of Ukrainians have been killed and millions forced from their homes. It was the biggest military attack since World War II - and sparked the biggest refugee crisis since then, also. Tomorrow is Ukrainian Independence Day. Here, DIANITA MARUNCHENKO, who fled Ukraine for Ireland in the aftermath, tells how her life has been completely changed by the war. I was born in 1996 in Ukraine's Odesa - the Pearl of the Black Sea. In the final year of my journalism course at university there, I got a job at the English-language newspaper The Kyiv Post, in Kyiv. A week before the war started, the boss sent me home to Odesa for safety reasons. It was hard to believe that a war could really begin. But on the morning of February 24, 2022 - 18 months ago today - it did. For Ukrainians, it divided our lives into the ""Before"" and the ""After"". For the first two weeks, I didn't even leave the basement of my home in the Primorsky district where I lived with my parents. Constant rocket attacks, explosions, and air raid alerts had a depressing GRIM Zelenskyy announces war effect on the psyche. My body began to shake and my eyes filled with tears as soon as I heard the explosions. I lived in a state of anxiety, until May. My patience snapped - I could not take any more. My mum Luidmyla and I fled Ukraine, and came to Ireland on May 16, 2022. We chose this country because of the language, primarily - but also because in Ireland, there was no need to look for a host family and apply for a visa, like in Britain. At first, we were settled in Shannon, Co Clare, with almost 100 other Ukrainian refugees, in what was the former Shannon Development Offices. Nightmares about war continued, but when I woke up in Ireland, I felt relieved that I was safe. STUDENT Dianita at Dublin City University However, living conditions there were abnormal to us. We couldn't lock the door. The bathroom was shared, there was no fire alarm and it was impossible to cook. I never ate the food that was brought to us. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't healthy. I cooked myself porridge in a kettle. We had sanitation problems. People ate from the same plates. The washing machine did not work. I developed redness around the mouth and the local GP said it was caused by unsanitary conditions. When I wanted to report this issue to the staff, Ukrainians started yelling, insulting me and mum, and shouting at us, saying if we complain, our living conditions will be made even worse. People looked at us with hatred, so we went back to the transit hub at Citywest, Dublin, to ask to be relocated. I showed a medical document, certifying I developed a disease due to bad conditions. So we ended up in a hotel in Howth, by the sea in Dublin. Mum and I were very pleased. Finally, we had our private bathroom. There was no fridge or cooking facilities, but we coped, with the help of a microwave. I started preparing documents for my admission to Dublin City University, for a Masters Degree in Journalism there. In my view, the education at DCU is of higher quality than at home, and includes a lot of practice a future journalist needs. In Ukraine, unfortunately, everything is based on studying theory. Here, I've been to the Criminal Courts of Justice, Dublin City Council, and reported on key national events. I continued to live in the hotel in Howth without any facilities for comfortable study - but that was the least of my problems. From my experience, no-one checks people's backgrounds when they are resettled. Criminals lived with us, and one of them confessed to stealing regularly in Ukraine. When he sent me a photo of his hand holding a knife, I started shaking. That night mum moved the bed to the door to make it harder to get inside and she couldn't fall asleep that night. The next day I plucked up the courage to talk to him about it and he claimed it was a joke. I told the hotel staff about the incident, but the man continued living there. It got worse. He said he wanted to date me. He began to carry a knife behind his back and showed it to me were from DIANITA YESTERDAY in the kitchen. When my mother spoke to him, he said he would hit her on the head if she interfered. With DCU STUDENTs' Union's help, I rented a room - despite the challenges of the housing crisis - and my life improved. Mum returned home to Odesa . Although it is safe in Odessa, I am worried about my loved ones when I receive an air raid alert on my phone.

My parents are proud that my articles are published in print media here in Ireland. When I fly home, I will bring them every edition with my features in it. After all we have been through, my mother says this is the best gift. Minister for Further Education Simon Harris said knowledge is the most powerful weapon, in an online press conferece with Ukrainian President Vololdymyr Zelenski in November last year, His words stayed in my head. He's right - if education is at a low level, bureaucracy, the suppression of the poor by the rich will flourish - and there will be no democracy. I am grateful to Ireland for helping Ukrainian refugeesand for all the opportunities. The Irish people are very friendly. This is what distinguishes them from other nations. My studies and lecturers at DCU will remain in my heart for ever. The Irish know what it is to defend their independence. I think their history inspires Ukrainians' faith in the victory. Ukrainians appreciate Ireland's help because here they feel more socially protected than in their native country . My mother always wanted me to speak English and hired private tutors. I would have never studied here without her efforts.

The Government is now looking at reducing social welfare supports for those coming in to flee the war. There were reportedly heated talks between ministers over limiting the provision of accommodation for them. The Tanaiste has, of course, tried to downplay the Cabinet split, but there's no doubt there has been tension over the spiralling issue. It's sort of alarming that the Government hasn't really anticipated this, however. Minister Simon Harris said it's now an opportunity to look at how we make sure our offerings are ""sustainable and durable for the weeks, months and potentially years ahead"". Shouldn't you have been thinking of this even before we accepted even a single refugee from Ukraine? Many of us feel that we would take in as many Ukrainians as we can, such is our culture, history and just human nature. Unfortunately, practical concerns have now caught up to us. This was always coming down the line, though. We had a housing crisis long before the war started and it's beginning to seem like we'll have one long after that conflict has ended. And that's without mentioning the problem of homelessness, where numbers just keep rising and rising. Meanwhile, the far-right will claim they were correct all along in claiming that 'Ireland is full', but this was never the case. In fact, it is still not the case. It's simply logistics that prevent us from looking after that many people's needs given we weren't prepared.

Many had just started jobs in the local community, while their children had also made friends nearby. These families were given just 48 hours of the decision to move them to a new area.

848,urc_thesun_raw.docx,The Sun,10/8/2022,971 words,NA,Refugee housing a 'grave crisis'; 'PINCH POINT' AS STUDENTS RETURN,"THE refugee accommodation crisis is set to hit a pinch point in the coming weeks as students look to return to college digs for the coming academic year. More than 4,200 Ukrainian refugees were placed in college campuses over the summer holidays as the Government struggled to keep up with the demand for accommodation. Some 3,000 Ukrainians were told this week they must leave their college housing before the end of the month with officials now scrambling to find new solutions. The Red Cross has been called in to help at Maynooth University and another Dublin college to try and find homes for 1,100 Ukrainians who must be moved in the next three weeks. But Red Cross Secretary General Liam O'Dwyer, left, yesterday warned the housing situation is in a ""grave crisis"". Here, our political correspondent ADAM HIGGINS runs the rule over the Government's proposed housing solutions for refugees. PLEDGED ACCOMMODATION Just weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, thousands of people had already signed up to open their homes to refugees fleeing here from the war. Over time, this number has reduced, with 30 per cent of people who offered to take in Ukrainian refugees changing their minds and withdrawing their pledge. Some 3,000 vacant houses have been offered for use along with 6,800 shared accommodation options, 3,000 Ukrainian which the Red Cross believe will be used up in the coming weeks. refugees. must college housing However, vetting people who are offering up the accommodation has a proved time-consuming, with officials requiring every person over the age of 16 living in the home to be Garda vetted. HOTELS AND B&BS Leasing hotel rooms on a large scale has been the Government's main tactic when dealing with the accommodation crisis for refugees. Almost 25,000 hotel beds across the country are currently being rented by the State for people who have come to Ireland to escape the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, the Government felt they had exhausted the available hotel capacity as hotels booked up during the busy summer tourism season. However, as the tourism season comes to a close soon, it's likely more hotels will offer their services to the State for Ukrainian refugees during the winter months. LOCAL AUTHORITY REVAMPS Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien ordered every local authority in the country to identify a building in their area which could be repurposed for housing refugees. This trawl brought up many options that the Department of Housing has already actioned - with some buildings being renovated to be turned into housing units. The first batch of these buildings who leave have been handed over to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth that is leading the Ukrainian housing drive. This batch of buildings will house up to 500 people and are already in use. The success of the first round has resulted in the Housing Minister going back to local authorities and asking them to search for more buildings. POP-UP HOUSING The Government has ordered 500 units of modular housing that can be built on any State site in a matter of weeks. 320 How people live in Gormanston These rapid-build homes are created in factories and delivered to a site ready to be assembled quickly. The Office of Public Works is leading this solution and have already earmarked 20 sites where 500 units of housing can be placed that will accommodate 2,000 people. However, the units take eight weeks to create in the factory and the Government only put in their order last month. This could be a great solution but it is expected the first units won't be available until November and the full order won't be delivered until early next year - so they won't be ready to deal with the pinch point in the coming weeks. TENTED ACCOMMODATION A tent town was 43,970 The of refugees. Ireland built a Gormanston Military Barracks earlier this year to be used as a last resort for Ukrainian families coming to Ireland. The facility can hold up to 320 people but is currently empty. The site was needed temporarily in recent weeks to house some 150 refugees before they were moved on to more permanent accommodation. Families that have escaped the invasion in Ukraine will share tents that accommodate 16 people each. many can tents in The makeshift tent town also includes a canteen and large children's play tents which are filled with toys and games. The Defence Forces are involved in building four more tent sites that will be built on State-owned International Protection Accommodation Service centres. CIYTWEST, DUBLIN Some 710 people stayed at the Citywest facility in Dublin on Sunday night. This enormous hotel and reception facility has been taken over by the Government since the Covid-19 pandemic, when it was used as a vaccine centre, testing centre and quarantine facility. The State has again taken over the facility for the Ukrainian accommodation crisis. Every person who arrives into Ireland from Ukraine is taken there to register. number Ukrainian in so far The site has previously filled up, with people then taken to other tents in Gormanston barracks. OTHERS The State has reached out to several other sectors in a bid to find accommodation solutions for Ukrainian people. The Department of Children is in talks with the Department of Sport and some of the country's biggest sporting organisations to see if there are any buildings that could be used. The State has asked the GAA, FAI and IRFU to help shelter Ukrainian people who have come here to flee the Russian invasion. Discussions between the Department and the sporting organisations are ongoing, but it is unlikely any major solutions will be found here. The State has also reached out to various religious organisations to see if they own any buildings across the country that could be quickly repurposed for housing.

The war had already been raging for three weeks. Our European allies had opened their doors to the refugees. Time was of the essence. These were largely women and children fleeing a lethally dangerous conflict zone. Since then, how many Ukrainians have been let into the country? Go on, take a guess. Bear in mind Germany has welcomed 316,000 refugees. Some 35,000 Ukrainians have gone to live in tiny Belgium. Poland has opened its doors to more than 2.6million. Even inhospitable France has let in close to 40,000. Cash-strapped and distant Spain? More than 110,000. And our figure? A magnificent 12,000. It's a bit shameful, don't you think? Is this because Ukrainians don't want to come here? Nope, there are at least 40,000 visas pending. But still the refugees fail to arrive. In all other respects, the UK's support for Ukraine has been steadfast, generous and admirable. We have been at the forefront of sending military equipment - along with experts to train the Ukrainian soldiers in how to use the new hi-tech weaponry we've bunged them. For this, the Ukrainians have been very grateful. Our Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has been singled out by Putin's gangster henchmen in the Kremlin as being the most ""hostile"" of European leaders. That's a badge Johnson wear with pride, of All the while France's President Emmanuel Macron was making increasingly useless phone calls to the Russki dictator. DESPERATE And Germany was getting cold feet over allowing so much as a spud gun across borders into Ukraine. But this is one area where we have utterly failed the people of Ukraine. These are not, in the main, long-term refugees. They are not the economic migrants who turn up in boats on our shores. They are largely women and children who have left their men to do the fighting home - to where they will return when Putin is finally defeated. They should be welcomed here. But the problem here is that we are still demanding that each refugee should have a visa. That means whole families cannot come the UK until every member has separately filled in a horrendously complicated visa form. And these visas are taking three weeks to process. In some cases that is the difference between life and death. Other European countries have scrapped the need for visas. Surely now, we should do the same. There's also the usual red tape from the council over where these refugees should be housed. The usual pencil-necked jobsworths with their clipboards. Don't they realise this is an emergency? fleeing Mariupol There is no real excuse for this shambles. We have to waive the restrictions and let more people in, quickly. Or we will become known as the country which, alone in Europe, failed to open its doors. Oh - and while we're on the subject, what should we do about Ryanair? The Irish airline charged a family of Ukrainian refugees an extra 60 euros for a boarding pass because its computer kept crashing and the family couldn't print a pass before coming to the airport in Poland. The family couldn't afford this extra money, so they lost their flight. If you're going away for the summer, make sure it isn't with Ryanair. Hit them where it hurts.

The sanctioned oligarch is secretly seeing Alexandra Korendyuk, an entrepreneur and TV star who appeared in Russian show You're All P***ing Me Off, it is claimed. Chelsea FC owner Abramovich, 55 - who was yesterday formally disqualified as a director of the club by the Premier League - was linked to Ms Korendyuk by Russian gossip columnist Bozhena Rynska. The same journalist first revealed that dad-of-seven Abramovich was due to wed his third wife, Dasha Zhukova - who he was married to from 2008 to 2018. Alexandra is said to be the founder of the Institute of Music Initiatives, which helps up-andcoming musicians. Rynska first reported that Red Rom was romantically involved with her last October, four months before the invasion of Ukraine. She said: ""Roman Abramovich's new girlfriend is very interesting. ""At the beginning of the year, rumours started that the oligarch's heart had been won over by Alexandra Korendyuk. ""There is very little information about the girl, but it is said that she is the founder of a company in the music industry. ""Abramovich's date has also tried her hand as an actress."" She played a hostess in two episodes of the Moscow-based series. Reports in Russia have said she had a ""closed lifestyle"". Regional experts say her surname links to her having Ukrainian family roots. A source added: ""It is ironic Abramovich has been linked with a lady with a Ukrainian background just as he's been sanctioned because of the war and his links to Putin. ""It is easy to see what he would see in her and this is apparently a relationship that has been going on for up to a year."" In 2018, Red Rom was linked to Russian ballerina Diana Vishneva, 45 - with reports suggesting she had ""conquered his heart"". He was said to have become ""transfixed"" by her dancing performances and used his private Boeing 767-33AER to fly to remote Perm in the Ural Mountains so he could watch her. But his spokesman dismissed claims of a romance with Vishneva - who is married and later gave birth to a son - as ""nonsense"". It comes as we can reveal Abramovich's UK homes could be seized - and used to house Ukrainian refugees who have fled the war. Abramovich was worth (EURO)11.2billion before last week's tough sanctions by the UK government. They have frozen his assets, barred him making money and stopped him selling Chelsea - leaving the club's future in limbo. Abramovich, whose investment vehicle MHC is run from offices at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground, has dozens of properties in the UK, Russia, US, France and Israel. His most valuable London property is a 15-bedroom mansion in Kensington, close to the Russian embassy and worth (EURO)180million. He also has a three-storey penthouse in Chelsea Waterfront Tower, which overlooks Stamford Bridge and cost him (EURO)35million in 2018. When he divorced his second wife Irina Malandina - mum to five of his children - in 2007, Abramovich is said to have transferred three properties in West Sussex and London to her. One of those, a five-storey Georgian townhouse in Chester Square in London's Belgravia, is thought to have been used by two of his children recently. Another of his daughters, Sofia, 27, is said to use the West Sussex mansion and has posted glamorous holiday snaps from the Caribbean. She also put an anti-war message on Instagram, saying: ""The biggest and most successful of Kremlin's propaganda is that most Russians stand with Putin."" But the family's comfortable UK lifestyle is now under threat as ministers draw up plans to seize British properties owned by Putinlinked oligarchs without paying compensation. Cabinet sources said UK Levelling-up Secretary Michael Gove proposed housing Ukrainian refugees in the lavish homes. Yesterday, the oligarch's whereabouts were unknown, but his (EURO)600million superyacht, Solaris, was tracked to Montenegro. Abramovich, said to have ""vetted"" Putin when he became Russian Prime Minister in 1999, has vanished from public view with suggestions he is lying low in Moscow. But there has also been speculation he is in Israel, where he owns a (EURO)77million mansion in Herzliya and land outside capital Tel Aviv. Abramovich was granted Israeli citizenship in 2018. He was also granted Portuguese citizenship in 2021 and is said to have been spending time there. @IrishSunOnline Graphic   Sanctioned ...

Boris Johnson vowed to bolster defensive lethal aid to President Volodymyr Zelensky's forces - including NLAW tankbusters. The PM's announcement came before he headed for Brussels today to push the EU and America to do more to help ""turn the tide"". He will set out plans to bolster Ukraine's defensive capabilities with long-range targeting and intelligence. And troops are preparing to deploy Sky Sabre anti-air missile systems to Poland to bolster Nato's eastern flank. The news came as Western officials warned that Russia may yet use tactical nuclear weapons - with nothing off the table in its playbook. Ministers will dish out another £25million for Ukraine's armed forces, more cash for the International Criminal Court's investigation into alleged war crimes, and £4million for the BBC World Service to tackle fake news. The PM said the West ""cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine into dust"". He added: ""The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight. ""One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice - we can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world."" The latest shipment of weapons will mean Britain has more than doubled its total sent there to 10,000 just days after Ukraine warned it was fast running out. The UK has already given 4,000 anti-tank artillery - including Nextgeneration Light Anti-Tank Weapons systems, or NLAWs, and Javelin misthings siles. Sweden will also double its contribution of tankbusters and equipment to rip up mines. The Ministry of Defence has supplied everything from Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to body armour, helmets and combat boots. As he faced calls to move faster in allowing Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK, Mr Johnson yesterday told his Cabinet that the West ""should not hesitate to go further in strengthening sanctions"" on Russia. Last night another truckload of medicines, including insulin and antibiotics, arrived in the wartorn capital Kyiv from Britain. The MoD has also called on YouTube to remove videos of Defence Secretary Ben Wallace that had been doctored by the Russian state, saying the footage ""created a substantial risk to UK national security"". But Russia's war machine was unravelling last night. Western officials believe six of their generals have now been slaughtered on the battlefield and one lieutenant colonel has been captured, along with large amounts of electronic warfare kit. Alexei Sharov, head of the 810th Guards Separate Order of Zhukov Brigade in the Russian Marines, was reportedly the fifth colonel to have been killed when he died in besieged Mariupol. One senior Putin adviser, climate envoy Anatoly Chubais, has resigned and fled Russia, the Kremlin confirmed. And a Russian soldier reportedly drove his tank into his commanding officer in protest at the loss of comrades. Col Yuri Medvedev was hospitalised with severe leg injuries. Putin's war was plunged into a deeper crisis with his Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu vanishing from view with ""heart problems"". The Russian tyrant is said to have started a witch-hunt among his inner circle after the US and Britain got leaks of his plans. Moscow yesterday warned Nato against sending peacekeepers into Ukraine, suggesting that it would constitute a ""direct threat"". And Putin announced that ""unfriendly"" countries will have to pay for Russian gas in roubles. natasha.clark@the-sun.co.uk The Sun Says - Page 12 Graphic   Success ... a Ukrainian with an NLAW near KyivDefection ...

It's causing havoc for people with OCD. I'm getting a bit sick of people moaning about the cost of tea, cakes and biscuits. If I hear any more complaints, I'll stop inviting friends over. But fear not. There is a New Age movement that could solve it all, called manifesting. It started with books like The Secret and was followed by a stream of ""gurus"" chanting mantras like ""dream it, believe it, do it"". They claim the universe is there to deliver ""abundance"" if you would only open your mind's eye. You start by emptying the thoughts from your head. (Some might find this easier than others.) Then tell me what you want, what you really, really want. Less zig-a-zig-ah, more ... Tibetan bells and ohms. Believers in the ""laws of attraction"" often use ""vision boards"" featuring images of their dream lives. Vision bored, more like. Putting one together is so dull you might think there had been a glitch in the spacetime continuum. But stick with it. If you want a new car, you might choose a Ferrari for your vision board. But that's not very good for the environment, so perhaps an EV. But there are no EV points where you live, so you're going to have to manifest a new home, ideally a solar-powered one. In fact, just find a picture of one of those homes from Selling Sunset. And if you don't have a load of magazines to cut the images from, nick them from the dentist. You're probably due an appointment soon anyway. Now, you should probably offer some rooms to Ukrainian refugees. This week Dutch royals announced they would house 30 refugees in a 15thcentury castle. If they can do it, so can Future You. It's a tricky job, manifesting, but you can dream it, believe it, do it. This week I found love in my soul and indulged in some unadulterated guilt-free manifesting for five straight hours. But do it too much and you could go blind. As I sat in a flow state, I thought about the cost-of-living crisis. What do we really need to get us out of this mess? I asked the universe for the National Insurance threshold to be raised to £3,000, for the basic rate of income tax to be cut to 19p and a 5p cut in fuel duty. They say: ""Dream big.""

983,urc_thesun_raw.docx,The Sun,10/2/2023,851 words,Damien Lane,"Shouting 'Ireland is full' isn't simply selfish, it's anti-Irish","MANY previously decent people have turned into irrational ranters parroting the lies and disinformation about ""Ireland being full"" fed to them via WhatsApp memes and hysterical Facebook posts. The transformation of a sizeable number of citizens into ""migrant-haters"" has happened at lightning speed and should worry every one among us who cares about democracy and truth and what it means to be Irish. The Government's commendable, if cack-handed, handling of the influx of Ukrainian refugees fleeing war, and other migrants seeking a better life, has been the spark to light the fire in the belly of the economically hard-pressed and poorly informed. Incensed by the misperception that the Government is placing the needs of refugees ahead of the ""needs of the Irish"", they have taken to the streets in large numbers over recent weeks. They march bearing Irish flags and end up outside hotels housing migrants, shouting: ""Get them out!"" Sometimes they target journalists or politicians with their vitriol. The spectre of violence always hangs heavy in the air. It's only a matter of time ? wait and see. The protests show no sign of losing momentum. The nefarious individuals and groups orchestrating things behind the scenes are becoming more brazen, more vocal and more dangerous. Many of those attending the ""antirefugees"" marches may consider themselves to be just ""concerned citizens"" and in no way racist, but by being seen shoulder to shoulder with known far- Right agitators dressed in black and wearing balaclavas, they have forfeited their right to be considered as they would wish. Logic dictates. The majority watch these marches with a sense of disgust. This is not who we are. Ireland is a nation that for decades emptied itself of its poor, its desperate, its educated and its best because the state didn't have the wherewithal to serve their needs. Famine, the great tragedy of the mid-19th Century, is a long way from the minds of those who crow now that ""Ireland is full"" and ""Put the Irish first"". That traumatic event in our history saw more than one million souls emigrate in the space of just 20 short years, most to the United States, a great many others to Great Britain. Our population, eight million before 1840, plunged to fewer than four million by 1880. Those who weren't fit enough to leave died or eked out an existence in the soup kitchen or the workhouse. What happened when the fleeing Irish arrived at Ellis Island in New York or the docks in Liverpool, in rags, desperate for refuge? They were placed in quarantine of course, treated as diseased creatures by the struggling US authorities. As the bedraggled Irish came off the ships, many Americans protested with antiimmigrant insults. The same happened to the Irish when they landed in Liverpool. The British authorities feared they were a revolutionary rabble and needed to be contained. If you were Irish you couldn't leave Liverpool. That harsh policy lasted for more than a decade, driven by irrational Westminster fears the Irish would lead a revolt, overthrow the state and declare a republic, with the help of the old enemy, France. God forbid! Which is why Liverpool to this day is so Irish. The poverty of the Irish situation continued for more than a century. The Irish emigrant fought on both sides of the American Civil War, many for no more than three square meals. In Britain, tens of thousands signed up to fight for King and Country in World War I for the same reason. In the wake of World War II, the Irish emigrant was at the vanguard in rebuilding Britain. They toiled for a pittance to build roads, houses and railways in the 1950s and 1960s. When I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, emigration was the leading concern too. So many of my generation left Ireland for a better life abroad. I went to Germany, my friends left for America and England. It would be years before we'd return. The IRA ceasefire in 1997, followed by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, changed things for ever in Ireland. The end of conflict brought a sense of self-belief. In the space of a few short years, Ireland's fortunes were transformed. Huge inward investment, the vast majority from US multinationals, helped fill the bare coffers. The Irish who left for America in the mid-19th Century left imprinted in the DNA of all those Irish-Americans who came after them the memory of suffering they endured. That would never be allowed to happen again. So when peace came, the Irish-Americans had our back. My generation of emigrants raced home, raised families here and helped build the new progressive, outwardlooking, generous, hopeful, inspiring, inclusive, diverse and tolerant Ireland I still believe in, despite all the growing pains we are now enduring because of a lack of infrastructure to house and nourish all our citizens and those who come here and want to be Irish like us. So, to those protesting against the poor unfortunates who've come here fleeing war, persecution and famine, remember your ancestors were just like them: desperate, hungry, traumatised and full of fear too.

""I do,"" he replied, solemnly, his face etched in what seemed to be sincere reflective remorse. ""REALLY?"" I exclaimed, stunned and incredulous. The great man paused for maximum effect, nodding slowly and very seriously. Then a massive smirk appeared on his ""tormented"" face and he cackled loudly: ""Do I f***!! I loved it all!"" And we both fell about laughing. Those few seconds perfectly encapsulated the character of the man who I'm lucky enough to call a friend, and who I consider to be Britain's most genuine, down-toearth and amusing star. But as we were reminded a few days ago, there's a lot more to Rod than just a great raspy voice, iconic spiky barnet and wise-cracking sense of humour. He's also an incredibly bighearted and generous guy, who cares passionately about his country. regret years boozing, hotel That's why I wasn't surprised to see him randomly call into Sky News last Thursday (though I did email him immediately afterwards, suggesting that next time he feels the urge to do something like that, could he please call into MY show!) to express his raw anger at the terrible state of the NHS. Do In an emotional exchange, Rod said he'd ""never seen it so bad"" and raged: ""There are people dying because they cannot get scans."" He then offered to pay for ""ten or 20 scans"" for people who aren't able to go private like him - something that may have saved his life when he got prostate cancer a few years ago, but survived because it was thankfully caught early. Extraordinary pledge ""I don't need the publicity,"" he said. ""I just want to do some good things, and this I think is a good thing. ""If other people follow me, I would love that."" The next day, he emailed me to say: ""No idea how I'm going to organise and pay for 20 scans for people who are desperate ... any ideas?"" I'm sure there will be a way for Rod, who turned 78 two weeks ago, to fulfil his extraordinary pledge, and I will help him in any way I can. But, more significantly, his unexpected public intervention into the mounting crisis of NHS waiting times fuelled days of newspaper headlines and TV and radio debate, and may shame the UK government into doing more, faster, to get people the life-or-death treatment they so urgently need. It's not the first time Rod's put his money where his mouth is. Three months ago, it emerged that he'd rented and furnished a house in Berkshire for a family of seven Ukrainian refugees, including five kids between two and 17, after he and his wife Penny were reduced to tears seeing the horrors of the Russian invasion unfold on TV. ""Words couldn't describe what we were watching,"" he said. ""The bombing of innocent children, of hospitals and playgrounds. Like everyone else, we were completely beside ourselves. This is pure evil."" Again, he spoke out publicly about his act of compassion because he wanted others to follow his lead. ""I am now a knight,"" he said. ""I should be using my power to do something for people. I am sure that if there are people out there who see what I am doing, they will pick up some slack, too."" Rod also hired three trucks filled with supplies for refugees and had them driven to Ukraine, using them to then safely transport 16 people out of the wartorn country to safety in Germany. None of this surprised me. Despite long-running rumours of his supposed meanness (Ronnie Wood branded him ""tight as two coats of paint"" and George Michael told me he and Elton John were convinced Rod once served them Dairylea cheese triangles for the starter at a fancy dinner at his Beverly Hills home, claiming it was rare, imported cheese), I've always found him to be extraordinarily generous, both with his money and his time. Three years ago, my father Glynne suddenly announced he'd bought four top-priced ((EURO)285 each) tickets to see Rod perform at the Sussex County Cricket Ground in Hove. He'd never done anything like this before. Indeed, my shocked mother disclosed after he dropped the bombshell that they hadn't attended a single concert in their entire five-decade marriage. But Dad, who used to play drums in a jazz band, explained: ""I'm 78, Rod's 74, and I want to see him play live before one of us dies."" When I emailed Rod to break this startling news, he replied: ""Brilliant, Piers! I'd love to meet them!"" He then fixed it for me, my parents and my sister to park our car backstage next to his chauffeurdriven Bentley - and invited us all to a meal in the green room with some of his own delightful family, including his 90-year-old sister Mary and brother Don, 89. Later, after a brilliant show, he invited us back for a few bottles of fine wine outside his trailer, where he chatted to Mum and Dad for ages like they were old friends. (When she got home, my mother posted a Facebook photo of herself gleefully hugging Rod with the caption: ""Died and gone to heaven!"" Despite this, Dad announced it had been ""a wonderful evening, worth every penny"".) Those who know Rod well all have stories like this, especially if it involves family, which is the most important thing in his life . honest and hilarious. He's a rarity for a popular celebrity: someone who is just as charming off camera as he is on it. There's no sinister dark side to him, and no raging narcissistic ego lurking beneath the cheeky grin. Rod's just a really good bloke who loves his wife, his kids, his siblings (Don and his other brother Bob both sadly died in recent months), his country and his football. When we bumped into each other at an LA party just before the 2015 Champions League Final, and I said I was going to watch it on my own, he exclaimed: ""Can't have that! Come and watch it with me at my mate Eddie Kerkhofs' house."" Eddie is a celebrated restaurateur who ran LA's hottest eaterie, Le Dome, for 25 years. We had a great afternoon, including a long boozy lunch during which Eddie revealed he once banned Rod from his restaurant. ""Why?"" I asked. ""Because Dudley Moore threw a pork chop at him, and Rod threw back a piece of calf's liver ... then all hell broke loose."" As for unsubstantiated Hollywood folklore that he once had sex in Le Dome's bathroom in between courses, Rod chuckled: ""No comment. Some things are best left to the imagination, old boy."" I've interviewed him many times and he is always refreshingly candid, honest and hilarious. After I replaced chat show legend Larry King at CNN, the network ran promos of me calling myself ""a little bit dangerous"". So when I turned up at Rod's Beverly Hills home to interview him in launch week, he greeted me at the door by hurling a very convincing toy hand grenade at me, shouting: ""I heard you're DANGEROUS so thought I'd come prepared!"" As we walked inside, Rod then pinched my backside for the CNN cameras, causing me to yelp. ""That'll kill your female audience,"" he chortled. The words ""national treasure"" are bandied about way too often about luminaries whom I'd regard more in the way comic Jack Whitehall once described me - ""a regional trinket"". But Rod really IS a national treasure - he's one of Britain's greatest musical talents, a funloving, decent family man and, as we saw last week, a ferociously proud patriot who wants to help those less fortunate than himself. bighearted guy, Piers: Do you regret all those years of womanising, boozing, drug-taking, hotel room-trashing?

But she is a survivor - and she and one-year-old daughter Varvara are now making a new life in Britain, where they have been given refuge. In an exclusive interview, Viktoriia told The Sun: ""When I finally arrived in Britain I felt such comfort. I felt safe at last. Half of my heart died with my family and half lives for Varvara, so I will celebrate Christmas and make her happy."" In the new year Viktoriia plans to make a complaint of war crimes against Vladimir Putin's forces for the trauma that ripped apart her family. Ukrainian and United Nations investigators have concluded that Russia has committed war crimes, and they have made the investigation of human rights violations a priority. Viktoriia is one of many victims. Her ordeal began when the family - she and husband Peter, their 12-yearold daughter Veronika and little Varvara, who turns two next month - tried to flee the Russian invasion. On March 5, near the village of Yahidne, their car was forced to a stop by large rocks blocking the road. But as Peter got out to move them, Russian soldiers opened fire. Viktoriia said: ""I didn't see them. It came from nowhere. I think it was a sniper. We were in the line of fire."" Bullet holes Their car windows shattered and she was showered by shards, leaving her hair covered in blood. Viktoriia said: ""I had Varvara in my arms and Veronika was sitting next to me. Veronika opened the door and started to get out, and I followed. ""I didn't see what happened, but as I got out of the car I realised my daughter was on the road and she had no head."" Still under fire, Viktoriia clambered into a roadside ditch, using her body to shield her baby. She continued: ""I saw my husband in the car and he wasn't moving and I realised he had died. ""I couldn't see the blood as the airbag had gone off and I could only see his leg. The car was on fire."" Viktoriia lay there for several minutes as shots rang out around them, then ran for shelter in an abandoned car riddled with bullet holes. She then found the courage to run a further 100 metres, while shielding her baby, with bullets still firing around her, to a deserted government building that had previously been used by Ukrainian troops. There was no running water, heat or electricity, but they did find discarded tins of meat and partly-drunk bottles of water left by troops. Viktoriia said: ""At night the shelling was going on around me and the building shook and windows smashed. ""It was cold, we were alone. I didn't have nappies or clothes as they were burned in the car. I had long hair and I cut it off as it was so matted with blood."" At 6pm the next day Russian troops searched the building. They heard Varvara's cries as they hid, leading ne Russian ""We'll save to their capture. One soldier told Viktoriia: ""Wyou and your baby."" g set free, e basement here Viktore held hosditions with rainians. at followed eople dying was used to a wall, to stones later.

Viktoriia now e soldiers hed our phones. They shut the door on us like animals."" Amid the horrific conditions, Viktoriia faced the trauma of Peter and Veronika's deaths. She said: ""I couldn't cry. I was numb. I was ready to die too. Varvara was my saviour. She is my reason to live."" Viktoriia asked Russian soldiers to recover her husband and daughter's bodies so they could be buried. They agreed on March 12. She said: ""A different group of Russian soldiers helped me from the ones that held us. I went to a forest with three of them. ""They took the bodies of my relatives into a forest. There were two crosses. When we were in the forest firing started. They ran, as there was shooting. ""One of the Russian soldiers put me to the ground and he protected me. In Yahidne there were around 2,000 soldiers and some soldiers killed people, some helped."" Around three weeks later, the Russians began their retreat from the north of Ukraine and Viktoriia was able to flee. Her husband's parents, who lived three miles away, found her and she then travelled on to Lviv, where she was introduced to British entrepreneur Derek Edwards, co-founder of UK charity Nadiya. Selfless people The charity has helped nearly 200 Ukrainian refugees into the UK with approved visas, and promised to do the same for Viktoriia and several of her relatives. But first, she had to get new passports for herself and Varvara, due to problems with her visa application. And that meant she had to return to the flat where the family had once happily lived. She said: ""I walked around the flat and my mind refused to believe that this is now my reality. It was still standing. I thought, 'Why has my daughter died and my flat is OK?' ""I felt like a child who wants a miracle to happen, to turn back time, for someone almighty to return my loved ones to me."" Further paperwork problems meant she was trapped in limbo from May 2 until last week, when Derek himself drove to the Polish- Ukrainian border to fetch her and Varvara, along with Viktoriia's brother Yuri, 35, his wife Tamara, 28, and their children Sasha, eight, and Olga, three. Viktoriia said: ""I couldn't believe there were selfless people like Derek. I had such emotion at what people have done for us in Britain and also for other Ukrainian people."" Viktoriia arrived in Britain on Saturday, and is now living in Kent, in a home provided by the Diocese of Canterbury. Derek said: ""I found out about Viktoriia's harrowing ordeal and I was determined to help her. After weeks of phone contact I met her for the first time on April 24 and I was struck by what an amazingly resilient woman she is. She has suffered unimaginable horror. ""I sobbed when they opened the door to their new home. It means the world to me that they are finally safe. But there's thousands of other Ukrainians who aren't."" It is now more than six months since the Government's Homes For Ukraine scheme launched, in which British people offered to accommodate Ukrainians for at least six months. As a result, many refugees have come to the end of their sponsorship period. Figures released this week show more than 2,000 Ukrainian families with children in Britain, as well as 900 individuals, have registered with local councils as having nowhere to live. With no credit history and without guarantors, many find it hard to find property in the private sector, even if they have a job. Nadiya is trialling a 100-home project around Milton Keynes in Bucks to offer assistance as guarantors, help with deposit payments, and three months rent paid up front. Derek added: ""But we also have 200 people still waiting in Ukraine for sponsorship with people in the UK. We desperately need sponsors for them. Viktoriia's family sponsor, Rev Julian Staniforth, of the Diocese of Canterbury, said: ""They've been through things we simply can't imagine, but we hope that in some small way we can make life feel a little bit safer and a little bit happier for them."" l To donate to Project Nadiya, which is fundraising for Viktoriia's family and other refugees, or to inquire about becoming a sponsor, see homesfor www.ukraine.org.

But Justice Minister Helen McEntee said she expects that number to rise in the coming days. The Government has simplified the process for people seeking refuge from the war here. Ukrainian arrivals will be immediately issued with a PPS number, allowing them immediate full access to supports provided by the State. Speaking alongside Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys at Dublin Airport, Ms McEntee said two-thirds of those arriving were female - many of whom left husbands and fathers behind in Ukraine. A processing facility has been set up at the airport, which includes toys and food for kids. Ms Humphreys said it is a ""very difficult situation"" for people who have escaped Putin's bombs.

He suspected something unusual was in the bag of Snackrite's ridged thick-cut cheese and onion as he grabbed it late last week. Savouring the moment, Michael said: ""I remember the packet feeling particularly bulgy. ""I put my hand in the bag and clasped on to the first crisp I could find.

1154,urc_thesun_raw.docx,The Sun,23/7/2023,1861 words,BETH NEIL,"You can wear make up and still be a mathematician'; Countdown whizz RACHEL RILEY on smashing stereotypes, taking on the trolls, and how she got Pasha to change his mind about having kids","As an Oxford University maths graduate who has blonde hair and hails from Essex, Rachel Riley knows only too well what it's like to be underestimated. ""When I was younger, people would be surprised when I said I was studying at Oxford,"" she says. ""I was known as a 'blonde Essex Girl' - but it's not always a bad thing, because you can use it to your advantage and surprise people in a positive way. It says more about them for having those misconceptions in the first place. ""I think it's really important to show you can be blonde, wear make-up and whatever clothes you want and also be a mathematician or scientist. You don't have to fit an outdated stereotype."" It's a lesson that Countdown's resident maths genius Rachel, 37, is keen to pass on to her daughters Maven, three, and 18-month-old Noa, who she shares with husband Pasha Kovalev, 43, the Strictly Come Dancing pro she was paired with while competing on the show 10 years ago. They got together in 2014, shortly after Rachel separated from her first husband, millionaire Jamie Gilbert. In the early stages of the relationship, however, Pasha was insistent that he didn't want to be a dad. ""He said he was a lone wolf and definitely didn't want children. But loads of my friends started having babies? Then, we were on holiday and decided we'd run out of places we wanted to travel to, so it was a case of: 'If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!' Let's have some children!"" says Rachel. ""And seeing that nurturing side of Pasha with the girls is so cute. We're both really enjoying being parents."" Their household expanded further last summer when Rachel and Pasha, who is Russian, took in four Ukrainian refugees. The war is deeply personal to Rachel and Pasha - along with many other Russians, his brother was forced to flee his country to avoid being conscripted, and is currently living in exile in Turkey. The refugees - a woman, her young son, aunt and mother - shared the couple's London home for more than a year, before recently returning to Ukraine to try to rebuild their lives. ""The girls loved it,"" says Rachel. ""It was like having loads of extra aunts, and the eight year old was like a big brother to them. ""They were from occupied territories in the east so they can't return home, but they're going to try and settle in western Ukraine. Life has been so hard for them here doing cleaning jobs, travelling across London on the bus and without the language skills to give themselves the comfortable life they had back home. ""They have family fighting, which puts into perspective how lucky we are."" It's not the first time Rachel, who is Jewish, has taken action for causes close to home. After calling out the Labour party and its then-leader Jeremy Corbyn for antisemitism in 2018, she found herself on the receiving end of troll attacks, including death threats, after which she was given extra security at Countdown's Manchester studios. It's clear how bruising the whole experience was for her, as she visibly shakes when talking about it. ""I think part of my personality must be argumentative,"" she says, half-joking. ""For me, it was incredibly personal. I did loads of research before speaking out, because I didn't want to wade into something I didn't know enough about. But I was also brought up knowing what happens when good people say nothing, so it was something I needed to do."" 'Social media became unusable' Rachel has since started working with the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) to campaign for better protection for social media users, and was awarded an MBE for helping raise awareness of the Holocaust and combating antisemitism earlier this month. Guided by the CCDH, she uses the ""block"" button more liberally on social media, rather than challenging online abuse directly. ""They target you because they want you to retweet and say: 'Look at this person, isn't this awful?' because it grows their following,"" says Rachel. ""We don't have to listen to this stuff. I don't see anything like as much of it as I used to, which is good, because it was like a swamp. I can 'bigger picture' it now without having to get in the mud with the pigs."" She says, for a time, her social media was so toxic it became ""unusable"", but she will continue to stand up - Rachel has also spoken in support of JK Rowling, who has come under attack from trans activists for her stance on women's rights. ""You have to fight for your freedoms and speak out,"" she says. ""Be aware of rights being eroded incrementally - we have to be vigilant. I want to bring up my girls to be strong, vocal women and they definitely are so far - they're going to be trouble!"" Pasha has been by Rachel's side throughout the ordeal of the last few years. The pair recently celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary, having married in Las Vegas while she was pregnant with Maven. In typical Vegas style, the budget ceremony was fairly spontaneous - they decided to do it just a few days before their trip to the States, and only told their families once it was signed, sealed and delivered. ""We'd had a couple of days in New York before flying to Vegas. As we got on the plane to Vegas, my mum sent me a jokey message saying: 'Have a good flight. If you get married there, I'll come back and haunt you!' But we'd already bought the dress - it was a brilliant day, such a lot of fun."" The pair are heading for dinner after today's photo shoot - a rare date night, which Rachel says won't be a late one, not with the 5am starts Noa is so fond of at the moment. Sleep often revolves around their youngest daughter, as Rachel is breastfeeding and has no plans to stop yet. ""For me, it's just easier. It gets her back to sleep, it's healthy and she's happy. It feels normal. I find it weird when places have signs saying: 'Breastfeeding welcome'. I don't need a sign - I'll breastfeed anywhere!"" She adds: ""At one point I was feeding both girls, one on each boob, as I didn't want to kick Maven off when Noa arrived and for her to feel resentful. So that was interesting! When they were little, they could come to the TV studio and I could feed them between shows. I was lucky."" Countdown has been Rachel's ""home"" for nearly 15 years, but she ended up on the telly almost by accident after her mum noticed that Channel 4 was recruiting to replace numbers whizz Carol Vorderman. Rachel had just graduated and applied on a whim, never expecting to get the job and knowing she had her degree to fall back on if it didn't work out. Over the years, she's hosted alongside several anchors, including Jeff Stelling and Nick Hewer - and former Radio 1 presenter Colin Murray since he joined last July. ""Colin is so competitive. He plays every single round and dissects it all with the contestants. He's a massive nerd and makes me and Susie [Dent in Dictionary Corner] look really cool! But he brings so much enthusiasm and he's very quick with a pun or references to bands or lyrics, which he'll weave into his next link. It's fun and everyone's enjoying it."" It sounds a bit different from the days of Anne Robinson, who was rumoured to have created a frosty atmosphere on set before quitting the show last year. ""It is very different,"" Rachel says carefully. ""Each presenter has their own style and you don't always gel with everybody that you work with."" In the past, Rachel has diplomatically described Anne as ""not the cuddliest"". ""Well, you're not going to get a sympathetic shoulder to cry on from Anne,"" she says today. ""But she might make you cry!"" Besides Countdown, Rachel works with organisations and charities, such as National Numeracy, and is passionate about encouraging more women into STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) careers. Just 24% of the UK's STEM workforce is female,* and research shows that 60% of girls aged 12 feel maths and science are ""too difficult"" to learn and are better suited to boys.** ""So much of it has to do with confidence, because women and girls are more susceptible to external pressures and what people tell them. National Numeracy found that the biggest indicator of whether someone will improve their numeracy is if they believe they can. Believing in yourself has a huge effect on outcomes, so we need to change the narrative,"" Rachel says. ""If you look back over the years, women were denied education, so the people who have made all the advances in science and maths are men. I went to a space museum in Moscow and they had glass cabinets filled with photos of cosmonauts from the 1960s to present day. You had to get all the way to the final cabinet before you saw two female faces. Without representation, it's hard to see yourself fitting into a group. ""A huge part of the solution to the climate problem is going to be STEM and it's where employment is going to be. We need more numerate-literate, scientificallyliterate and technologically-minded people - and we need women at the table."" Climate-conscious Rachel and Pasha switched to an electric car last year and the whole family is vegan. It's why she's fronting a campaign by Hello Hydrogen to raise awareness of hydrogen as a future energy source for UK homes. Rachel's quieter house is about to get even more so, as Pasha heads on a nationwide tour with dance musical La Bamba!, meaning long spells away from home until November. ""The pandemic meant a lot of his work was cancelled, so we're used to having him around. And we've had the Ukrainians living with us like a big reciprocal family, so there's always been someone there to watch the girls if I've needed to nip out. We really need to sit down and map it all out-"" Does it feel like 10 years since Strictly brought them together? ""They gave us a bottle of champagne with Strictly written on it and I've still got it in the cupboard. I should open it, as it's been 10 years, although it's probably turned to vinegar by now! It's a long time, isn't it? Four years married and two little girls- I did a podcast with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, who was on Strictly with me and we said: 'Ten years - how has that happened?!'"" Rachel supports hydrogen as an energy source for the home (www.Hellohydrogen.com). PARENTING CLUB Most embarrassing parenting moment? I took the kids to a festival at our synagogue and there was storytelling for the little ones. It was really quiet when Maven said: ""I want some ham!"" I had to hurriedly point out it was vegan ham! Best advice for a new mum? You don't need new baby clothes! Look for children's charity shops - they have everything you could possibly want. The stuff is next to new and you're giving money to charity, too. Best parenting hack? My friend had a cot called a Snoo, where you secure them in, so they're coddled on their back. If they start crying, it responds with different levels of rocking and soothing sounds. Who's your parenting inspo? Sophie Ellis-Bextor. She has five boys between four and 18, and everyone does their own thing. It's just really nice. Biggest parenting win? When they tell you they love you.

1169,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,30/6/2022,971 words,Miranda Bryant,Calls for more funding for English classes for Ukrainian refugees,"Language schools and community groups have called on the government to increase funding for free English classes for Ukrainian refugees, saying they are being inundated with applications. Providers have reported waiting lists of thousands and Ukrainians around the UK joining their online classes because they do not have anything nearby. Demand has especially gone up in recent weeks, they said, as thousands of newly arrived refugees, many of whom are suffering trauma and have had their former homes destroyed, attempt to set up a new life in the UK. Access is a particular problem among Ukrainian refugees because as predominantly women and children, a lack of childcare at most classes prevents many of them from attending.  The Ukrainian Institute in London said its waiting list for online and in person classes has more than 5,000 people on it. In Paddington the charity teaches 220 students and they soon have 35 more students starting at another site in west London, where they are also planning to provide childcare. Maria Montague, the Ukrainian Institute’s deputy director, said: “There is definitely a huge, huge demand that is not being met. The more English schools that are supported, the better.” The timing of most volunteer-led classes, in evenings and weekends, makes it especially difficult for mothers, she said. “If they can’t bring their kids with them, in general then a lot of the time that means they can’t access it.” She said classes were available at adult education colleges, but that many did not have places until September, which is too long for many refugees to wait, who need it now. “English is just absolutely key to every stage of trying to get settled in the UK. It’s absolutely at the core. Students tell us how much they need the English just to be able to go about with their lives,” she said. WEA, the largest charitable provider of adult education in England and Scotland, said they had seen a significant rise in demand for English classes, which they expected to “grow more and more”. But they have had to use existing government funding to support Ukrainian refugees because they have not received any new funding to pay for it. Simon Parkinson, the WEA’s chef executive, called for a more “joined up” governmental approach so they can ensure the appropriate resources are in place before an influx of people arrive in a particular part of the country, adding that funding for community-based adult education has been falling for the last 10 years in real terms. The lack of availability and funding has left voluntary organisations “bridging the gap” with untrained teachers, according to community organisers. In south London, the White Eagle Appeal has set up weekly English classes at the request of the Ukrainian community. On Wednesday night, dozens of adults and their children filled the White Eagle Club, a Polish community centre in Balham, for refreshments before dividing up into three groups depending on their English level. In the beginners class, mainly female students ranging from their 30s to 60s sat around two large tables learning how to introduce themselves in English. The experience is also new for their volunteer teacher who usually works in marketing in the city. Among the advanced pupils is Anastasia Shilakhtina, 33, a lawyer who moved from Mariupol to Streatham in April with her son Max, nine, who said she needed to improve her English to find good work opportunities. “My city is under Russian control right now, my house is destroyed and I have no choice,” she said. Liza Aleksyeyeva, an international environmental lawyer from Lviv, started going to the sessions with her six-year-old daughters Yeva and Polina to practise her English. While she speaks fairly fluently, she is not yet confident discussing policy issues for her job. “Here we said it would be good to have a discussion club to practise speaking English and I’m still looking for other experiences to get to the place where I can talk about policy issues and more important stuff than traffic and cooking and stuff like that.” In Sheffield, Hayley Nelson, director of Learn for Life Enterprise, which runs a total of 30 in-person and online English classes a week and is teaching around 75 Ukrainians, said they are also seeing huge demand. “We’re getting people signing up for classes from London, in Wales, in other parts of South Yorkshire,” she said. “They can’t find classes in their area so they’re coming to our classes. And we’ve got women and young children who are attending online because they can’t get childcare.” They want to put on more classes but first they need to recruit more volunteer teachers. “There is a need for class provision and funding provision because we’re not getting funding for this,” she said. “We’re just doing that because we think they should be able to learn English when they’ve arrived.” Urging the government to “catch up with the situation”, she said there should be flexible funding that community organisations can apply for from the government to teach English to new arrivals, adding that any council help would only take them through to the end of July. The Local Government Association said English classes were not generally provided by councils, saying it was an issue for the government. According to government guidance, £10,500 per person funding to councils can be used to fund education and skills support. A government spokesperson said: “The government acted quickly so that all Ukrainian adults and their families could immediately access the same education and childcare as a UK citizen. “This has included access to education and training funded through the Adult Education Budget, including English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) courses. All eligible Ukrainian refugee families can also access our free early education entitlements.”",Broadsheet,1

As the Homes for Ukraine scheme launched on Friday, allowing UK residents to sponsor visas for non-family members, Ukrainians who had already applied to join relatives in Britain under an earlier scheme expressed dismay at the long waits for visa approvals. At least 43,000 have applied for Ukraine family scheme visas and are waiting for their applications to be approved. Many of them are staying in hotels in countries bordering Ukraine, repeatedly checking their emails to see if visa clearance has been granted. Taitiana Dembicka, 73, a retired university administrator from Kyiv, has changed hotel in Bucharest six times in the past seven days as she waits for a visa to allow her to travel with her son, Eugene, a British citizen, to his home in the UK. Many of the city's hotels are crowded with refugees and they have struggled to find somewhere to stay for more than one night. Her application was submitted two weeks ago, on 4 March. When staff in the office of Eugene's local MP, Lucy Frazer, asked the Home Office why the process was taking longer than anticipated, they were told that further checks had been requested. ""I feel disappointed,"" Eugene said. ""She has applied previously for a UK visa many, many times, so I'm not clear what they're actually checking."" Taitiana said: ""We're told that UK government is helping us, but we don't feel it."" Sarah Keeley, an immigration lawyer who has volunteered to offer free legal advice to Ukrainians fleeing the conflict under the Ukraine Advice Project , said she had heard from many people stuck in hotels waiting for visas to be approved. She said the problems were mostly caused by the government's decision not to waive visas for people travelling from Ukraine. ""We are pushing people through a managed migration visa process which necessarily creates these unconscionable delays,"" she said. Natalia, a Scottish university employee, who asked for her surname not to be published, was waiting for her 72-year-old mother's visa application to be cleared. Her mother fled Kharkiv with just a handbag earlier this month and is stuck in Warsaw until her UK visa, which she applied for a fortnight ago, is processed. ""What really infuriates me about this whole situation is not the wait in itself, and not even the significant financial cost, but a total lack of communication and accountability,"" Natalia said. Anna Malyna White, an interpreter from Glasgow, was still waiting for visas for her parents, 84 and 82, to be approved two weeks after they applied. She was staying with them in a hotel outside Budapest. ""Everything is done to make this process as difficult and complicated as possible,"" she said. ""I was advised that my parents should fall into a priority category due to their age and health issues. We are surviving on a credit card as nobody could foresee being drawn into such a complicated red tape visa process. There is no communication with the [Home Office] and there is no mechanism allowing us to track our progress online."" Figures for the number of people applying to sponsor Ukrainians under the new Homes for Ukraine scheme have not been released. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and the changes we've made to the visa process are making it quicker and simpler for Ukrainians to come here, as well as ensuring those already here can stay. Staff are working seven days a week to process applications as quickly as possible.""",Broadsheet,1
1195,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,25/3/2022,1011 words,Amelia Gentleman,Ukrainian refugees: frustration grows over long wait times for UK visas,"Some Ukrainian refugees have described being forced to return to Ukraine because of protracted delays in securing UK visas, while others are living in underground bomb shelters in Kyiv, dismayed by the long wait for visas to be processed. A month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine 10 million people are believed to have left their homes, of whom 3.6 million are thought to have left for neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The Home Office has granted 18,600 visas to Ukrainian relatives of UK citizens, but there is rising frustration among those who have applied for visas under the government's two schemes - a family process and sponsorship programme - many of whom describe long delays without any way of knowing the status of their applications. Some refugees are stuck because their passports are believed to be locked up in a UK visa processing centre in Kyiv, which has now been closed due to the fighting. Others are worried because they are running out of money to pay hotel bills while they wait. Some families have been split because visas have been granted at different times. British national Nadiia Mackowiak, a London-based interpreter, is puzzled that visas have been granted to her father, sister and five-year-old niece, while her mother, Nadiia Pavlenko, is still waiting, 18 days after applying. ""My parents had to leave Kyiv after a missile hit their home; they saw their block burning and falling down. My mother is in very bad way, and is desperate to be with us here,"" she said. Her sister and niece have traveled to the UK, but her father and her mother, who ran a nursery in Kyiv until earlier this year, are still in Poland, staying with strangers who have given them a room. Her mother has twice been issued with UK visas previously. ""It's hard to understand what the problem is; it's too much bureaucracy. These people have fled a war."" Sandip Basu, a volunteer legal adviser with the Ukraine Advice Project, said he had advised one family of refugees who fled Ukraine in late February and applied for UK visas Budapest, but were forced to return to Ukraine while they waited two weeks for the visas to be processed ""It was clearly a dangerous measure but they could not afford to remain in Budapest,"" he said. Since 6 March, Michelle Potts has been in a rented one-bedroom flat in Bucharest with her 72-year-old mother-in-law Olga Selivanova, who uses a wheelchair, and her 12-year-old twin godchildren, who have left their village on the outskirts of Kyiv. ""We were told it would take five days to process their applications on 9 March, but we're still waiting. The children don't understand why it's taking so long. The UK visa system isn't fit for purpose at the best of times; it's certainly not fit for emergencies."" Tatiana Dembicka, 73, a retired university administrator from Kyiv, has been waiting since 4 March for her application to join her son, Eugene, a British citizen in the UK. Her case was raised with the home secretary and with the minister for refugees Lord Harrington by her son's MP Lucy Frazer, and she was told that a decision had been made on Tuesday, however her family was still waiting on Thursday for an emailing explaining what the decision was. ""I can't see why there is such a delay between a decision and notification,"" her son-in-law Karl Dembicki said. ""We feel embarrassed by the government's lack of empathy."" Several people described technical and practical difficulties with the Homes for Ukraine application form. One man said the woman he was hoping to sponsor was living in an underground shelter in Kyiv, and unable to return to her flat to collect documents required for the form. ""It is nerve-racking. The situation in Kyiv is not great. Due to the lack of the required document, we're not sure what the outcome of the visa application will be, but we're hoping for the best,"" he said. Clare Birkbeck, who is studying for a masters, said she was one of a group of about 10 families in Saffron Walden, Suffolk, trying to host refugees; she hopes to host Katryn Zakharchuk 35 and her son Alexander Zakharchuk 15. ""It's a black hole of stress. Katryn and her son are sleeping on the floor of a room in Krakow, belonging to a very kind Polish man, with six people, unable to access funds from their Ukrainian bank. We've had no further communication since submitting the form; you just have to wait. They are desperate and I'm unable to help because of the shambolic system."" Lucy Ward, a writer, said she had spent over seven hours grappling with forms to sponsor two mothers and two children over the weekend. ""There are a lot of baffled people; I speak Russian and I'm used to filling in visa forms, but I still found it confusing,"" she said, adding that there was a lot of pressure on hosts to make it work. ""It's so devolved. It's like a Victorian charity or a knit-your-own refugee scheme. I know it's been done quickly, but there has to be a better way."" The refugees are currently staying in a school sports hall in Poland. ""We've been told nothing about how long it might take,"" she said. Robina Qureshi, director of the refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said her charity was assisting 415 who were trying to be matched with UK sponsors. ""No one is getting visas from the families we are helping. Many families are living in war zones in Ukraine and won't leave until they know they can travel to the UK. The UK's visa approach to refugees is putting them at additional risk; under the refugee convention they don't need a visa,"" she said. The local government associations said it was still waiting to be given guidance on exactly how and when safety checks on sponsors' homes should be done. A government spokesperson said changes had been made to simplify the visa application forms, adding: ""We are very aware that many people fleeing Putin's invasion will not have certain documents with them. While such documents can aid the application process, our case workers are taking a compassionate, commonsense approach.""",Broadsheet,1
1196,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,23/12/2022,1137 words,Clea Skopeliti,‘I’m in a safe place’: Ukrainian refugees’ mixed feelings about Christmas in UK,"Like many Ukrainian refugees, Yuliia Kashperenko will spend Christmas away from home this year. She feels upset at the thought of being away from her family and friends in Ukraine, but comforted to know she will spend the holiday with her host and their children in south London. Kashperenko, 25, arrived the UK in October, leaving her parents behind in the Kyiv region. “With this family, I feel like I’m with my family,” she says. “I realise it’s better to stay here. I’m in a safe place with good people.” The Ukrainian government advised refugees not to go home over Christmas, because of fears the country’s energy infrastructure would not be able to deal with the demand, meaning many will spend the holiday apart from loved ones. Ukrainians traditionally celebrate Christmas on 7 January, according to the Julian calendar, but after Russia’s invasion, the country’s Orthodox church is allowing its congregations to observe the 25 December date instead in a move toward the west. Kashperenko, who worked in the media and as a copywriter in Ukraine, arrived in London after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled because she was worried about attacks on the capital and being forced to survive the winter without power. “I understood that Russia was going to destroy cities and energy systems,” she says. She describes her sponsor, who is in her early 60s, as a “really nice woman with a good humour”. “I’m lucky to live with her. We spend time together, cook together. We drink wine and talk about the situation in Ukraine, London, relationships, politics.” They have spent the run-up to the festive season decorating the house and doing Christmas baking. Kashperenko says she tried her first mince pie the other day. Her sponsor has also helped her set up her life in the UK, accompanying her to appointments at the local jobcentre and the council. She also arranged for her to have English lessons. “She helped me to believe in myself,” she says. Kashperenko recently began working six days a week as a waitress in a central London restaurant. She enjoys the city’s bustling atmosphere and says she feels at home there, but emphasises she is not in the UK by choice. “I want to live in Ukraine with my friends and parents and help my country,” she says. “Russia [has] destroyed everything. People are not thinking about how to spend their Christmas, they’re thinking about if they’ll have power.” Like Kashperenko, Iryna has begun to feel at home in the UK town she moved to with her two children in May. The 48-year-old was on her way to her work’s Christmas party in Frome, Somerset, when she took a moment to reflect on her life in the town. “There will always be a special place in my heart for this small town that gave us shelter and safety. Frome is a synonym [to] me for being safe, a second home,” she says. Iryna moved from the Kyiv region with her 21-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son. She had never visited the UK before Russia’s invasion. She is effusive about how welcoming their sponsors, a couple in their 60s, have been: “They are some of the best people I’ve ever met. I will be grateful all my life. They always say ‘you’re our family’, and we consider them to be ours as well.” Iryna and Kashperenko emphasise how well-matched they have been with their sponsors, but others have not been as lucky. Community organisers have said relationship breakdowns between hosts and refugees have resulted in rising numbers of Ukrainians being made homeless.  Iryna emphasises her sponsors’ generosity and warmth, but says it is different from being at home: “We have a very good relationship but I sometimes feel we’re stealing personal space. We’re in someone’s home and at some point we have to go. “My husband, my sister, my parents and in-laws are all in Ukraine. It’s really hard for them, and us sometimes, when we don’t have proper communication, when there’s no electricity.” Her children also miss their lives in Ukraine. “They are very homesick. My son goes to college and has made friends but he misses his friends at home. He is constantly texting,” she says. “We’re lucky to be here, but this move was a forced decision. We took two suitcases and I grabbed our documents and some photos of my family.” She says she wanted to go home over Christmas, but her family were worried about their safety. Iryna, who was an HR manager before she fled, has been working for Frome’s Refugee Support Hub since October. She knows how tough it has been for many Ukrainians to find housing, in particular. Rents “are extremely expensive and it’s really difficult to find properties”, she says. “We don’t have credit history or guarantors in the UK.” A survey of Ukrainians in the UK by the Office for National Statistics found that 45% had experienced barriers to accessing private rented accommodation. The number of Ukrainians seeking emergency accommodation in England has also risen as the six-month mark for many involved in the Homes for Ukraine scheme passed. Andrii Samusiev, 43, came to the UK after the Scottish government acted as a “super sponsor” for his family, allowing them to leave Lokhvytsia, in central Ukraine, for Aberdeen in June. Samusiev, his wife, Olena, and their four children, aged 11-16, have been living at a hotel since then, accommodation Samusiev says they are very grateful for. Samusiev was able leave Ukraine under a martial law exemption for men who financially support three or more children. He worked in land management in Ukraine and is now studying English at a local college, aong with Olena, 34, and their eldest child. He is concerned about securing the family’s future in the UK. “I am worried about [being able] to find a decent job to be able to rent a house and educate our children,” he says. “We are trying to find at least a part-time or remote job while we study.” Their children are adapting well though, Samusiev says. They attended a sports camp over the summer and they have been well-supported at school.  “Despite the fact that there is still a language barrier, thanks to the youth programmes they quickly found friends,” he says. He says he and his wife volunteer with Aberdeen’s Ukrainian community and take part in local initiatives such as tree planting. “We actively try to integrate into society, to be useful here, and the Scots help us a lot in this. We are very touched by this.” With Christmas around the corner, Samusiev and his wife have sent gifts back to their parents in Ukraine: warm clothes. “Electricity and heat are constantly cut off,” he says. “We are very worried about them and miss them.” They plan to have a Christmas video-call “provided there is electricity in Ukraine at that time”. His children wish they could spend the holiday in Ukraine with their friends, he says. “If they believed in santa, they would ask for just that.”",Broadsheet,1
1198,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,23/8/2022,419 words,Matthew Weaver,‘You should try fish and chips’: UK scouts praised for welcoming Ukrainian refugees,"Scouts in the UK have been praised for setting adults an example on how to welcome refugees after they made hundreds of messages of support for Ukrainian families fleeing the war. “You are so brave and I hope you like it here,” wrote one scout in a decorated card. Another said: “REMEMBER YOU ARE LOVED.” Among other messages were: “Let us take you to safety” and “You should try fish and chips.” The messages from scouts aged 12-15 were made to mark six months since the start of Russia’s invasion. They will be shared with recently settled Ukrainian families in the UK in welcome packs from Save the Children. Meg Briody, the head of child and youth participation at Save the Children, said the messages showed the best side of the UK’s attitudes towards refugees. “Children and young people are once again setting an example in showing that the UK can be a welcoming place for refugees.” Some of the messages were displayed on the wall of a community hall used by Mereworth and Kings Hill scout troop near Maidstone as part of the Kent international jamboree. The messages’ welcoming sentiments are in sharp contrast to the abuse some asylum seekers have received when they land on the Kent coast after crossing the Channel in small boats. Heath Langford, 12, also a scout with the troop, said: “On my message I wrote welcome to the UK, enjoy your stay and we stand with you. I said that because we’re a country that knows [how] to help other countries and welcome refugees. I think people coming here must be feeling very scared.” Daisy Stafford, 13, a fellow scout, said: “I wanted to write that it’s safe and to enjoy your time here and just to show that we are friendly in the UK, and we welcome them.” Kate Shuttleworth, leader at the troop, said: “Our scouts are perhaps a little bit more aware of refugees because we are in Kent and it’s an entry point. They see it on the national and local news. As a group, we do talk about things to be more globally aware. We are from a fairly affluent area, so we want people to be aware that not everybody is as wealthy as we are.” The adventurer and chief scout, Bear Grylls, said: “As scouts we are committed to peace and international friendship. We believe in our shared values of kindness, care, cooperation and most importantly respect for all. “I am super-proud of the letters, drawings and videos that scouts have created about life in the UK to welcome young people as they arrive from Ukraine and around the world. We are living our scout promise to help others.”",Broadsheet,1
1201,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,25/4/2024,785 words,Shaun Walker in Warsaw,Poland and Lithuania pledge to help Kyiv repatriate Ukrainians subject to military draft,"Poland and Lithuania have said they are prepared to help Ukrainian authorities return men subject to military conscription to the country, after Kyiv announced this week that it was suspending consular services for such men who were now abroad. “We have suggested for a long time that we can help the Ukrainian side ensure that people subject to [compulsory] military service go to Ukraine,” Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s defence minister, told the television channel Polsat, though he did not elaborate on what mechanisms could be used. His Lithuanian counterpart, Laurynas Kasciunas, said his country may make similar efforts. “Ukraine is very short of mobilisation reserve … This is not fair to those citizens who are fighting for their country,” he said on Thursday. Ukraine is struggling to overcome a huge equipment and personnel deficit in comparison with Russian troops at the frontline. The parliament has recently passed a new law on mobilisation, which lowers the age at which men can be called up from 27 to 25.  Callout  On Wednesday, the foreign ministry announced that it would suspend consular services for men subject to the draft who were living abroad. There were angry scenes at consular offices and agencies in Poland later in the day, where men who had booked appointments to pick up documents were told they could not do so. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the Guardian on Wednesday that it was unacceptable for Ukrainian men outside the country to “sit down in restaurants” while others were dying, and said the move was partly about demonstrating fairness to those who were at the front. “They don’t understand why the government is not trying to bring more people into the war effort,” he said. Thousands of men are believed to have crossed Ukraine’s western borders illegally since the war began, sometimes paying bribes to make it across. However, many other Ukrainian men have lived outside the country for years. Some returned after the war started, but many have lives and families outside the country and do not wish to return. There are also many Ukrainian men in Europe from war-torn eastern areas of the country who left their homes via Russia in the early stages of the war as it was the only way out. Igor Lisin, vice-president of Foundation Ukraine, an organisation working with Ukrainians in Poland, said that while there were no official figures for how many men of military age were currently living outside the country, as a “very rough estimate” he believed about 300,000-400,000 were currently in Poland. Tadeusz Kolodziej, a lawyer with the Ocalenie Foundation, a Polish NGO, said there was no mechanism by which Polish authorities could deport Ukrainian men to Ukraine, and no current plans to declare their presence in the country illegal. But the Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity. “The draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports,” Kolodziej said. In time, there may also be questions about whether people without a passport can work legally. “If it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum,” Kolodziej added. Exactly how the new regulations will work may not be clear until the new law on mobilisation comes into force in mid-May. It is possible that men will be able to update their records in the military register using an app from outside the country, rather than returning home to do so. “Of course, they want people to come back, but there is no legal instrument to force them,” said Lisin. However, he said the recent messaging had caused stress and fear among many in Poland’s Ukrainian community, partly because of the uncertainty over how it would work in practice. “The less people know, the more people fear,” he said. Poland drew plaudits for the way it opened its borders to Ukrainian refugees in the first months of the war and the Polish government remains one of Ukraine’s most vocal backers in the EU. However, there has been evidence of increasing “Ukraine fatigue” in Polish society as the war drags on. Protests by Polish truckers over transit access for their Ukrainian counterparts blocked the border between the two countries for several weeks, while surveys show attitudes to Ukrainian refugees are becoming gradually less welcoming. “I think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine,” said Kosiniak-Kamysz.",Broadsheet,1
1203,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,16/6/2022,989 words,Emily Dugan,"Hundreds of Ukrainian refugees left homeless in England, data shows","Hundreds of Ukrainian families have been left homeless in England after arriving on visas designed to secure them a place to live, official figures reveal. Since the end of February, at least 480 Ukrainian families with children and 180 single adults have applied to councils for help with homelessness. Despite the government insisting that the Homes for Ukraine and family visa schemes would ensure that refugees had housing, both are leaving people struggling when arrangements break down. The data exposes the cracks already appearing in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, with 145 placements having ended in homelessness by 3 June. Of these, 90 ended because the arrangement broke down and a further 55 never got off the ground properly because the accommodation was unavailable or unsuitable on arrival. Lauren Scott, executive director of Refugees at Home, said: “We are frustrated and saddened but not surprised to see placements start to break down. Expecting vulnerable, traumatised refugees to rely on the goodwill of strangers they have met on Facebook was always a risk. “We urgently need a joined-up national fallback plan to help families whose placements go wrong. Across the country there is no consistent approach to rematching guests with new hosts, no standard way for Ukrainians to change their visa sponsors, and no single mechanism for moving funding from one host to another.” Many local authorities are treating Ukrainian families as homeless rather than attempting to rematch them with new hosts, leaving them in hostels and hotels, just as happened with Afghan refugees. Of the 145 failed Homes for Ukraine placements, only 20 were rematched with a new host. Scott said: “It is a nightmare situation – the very one that we had hoped to avoid.” Anna, 37, fled Kyiv with her husband and their three-year-old son when war broke out. They came to Britain at the end of March after matching with a family of four who lived in a large house in Northampton. After initially being welcoming, their hosts became less enthusiastic within a few weeks. “We didn’t understand what was happening because they changed their mood very quickly,” Anna said. Anna and her family were moved into an annexe. The host said he wanted a key to it and they agreed as long as he warned them before going in, but shortly afterwards he called the council to say he wanted to terminate his sponsorship. “They didn’t explain anything to us,” Anna said. “They were not ready to share their house. They tried to get rid of us as soon as possible.” Her family were put up in a Travelodge for several days by the council, sharing one room with no cooking facilities. They had no idea where to go. “We were desperate and felt we didn’t have any other options than to go back to Ukraine,” Anna said. Finally, after trawling the internet, they found Refugees at Home, who helped place them with another family. They are still scarred from the experience. “We lost our home in Ukraine, and when we came here we thought that we were safe, but actually we weren’t and we lost our home a second time.” The family visa scheme, which has been running the longest, accounted for 455 homeless applications. In many cases, families desperate to get their relatives out of Ukraine applied for visas but never had room for them to stay. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said: “It is worrying to see that desperate Ukrainian families who have fled war, endured trauma and heartbreak, arriving here, entrusting their safety in our hands, to have been left to fall into homelessness. “Ukrainian families arriving here need a warm welcome, safe housing and benefits, emotional support, and connection. We’re concerned that Ukrainians arriving on family visas are running into problems as not all relatives will have the space or the resources to support their family members – which is why there needs to be the same level of funding available to them and local councils as is provided under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.” Lisa Nandy MP, shadow levelling up and housing secretary, said: “It is utterly shameful that families that have fled Putin’s brutal war have found themselves homeless here in the UK. “The British people showed amazing generosity in stepping up in their thousands to provide the care and sanctuary that these people – many of them families with young children – needed and deserved in such awful circumstances. “But the government has failed miserably to play its part. Ministers were warned about the risk of refugees becoming homeless on the day they launched the sponsorship scheme, but they were more interested in grandstanding in television studios than doing their jobs to protect vulnerable people. “The government must urgently set out a plan to support councils to find safe homes for these families.” Cllr David Renard, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: “Currently, councils receive no data on, or funding for, people who are coming under the family visa scheme. Some of those families present as homeless once they have arrived, but we are asking that they should be able to be rematched with a sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. “Urgent work is needed on how councils can work with government and the community, faith and voluntary sector so those offering their homes can be quickly matched with a family in need.” A government spokesperson said: “More than 77,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK since Putin’s invasion and all arrivals have access to benefits and public services, as well as the right to work or study, from the day they arrive. “The overwhelming majority of people are settling in well, but in the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. Councils also have access to a rematching service to find a new sponsor in cases under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.”",Broadsheet,1
1207,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,3/6/2022,752 words,David Blood,UK takes in fewer Ukrainians per capita than most of Europe,"The UK has taken in fewer Ukrainian refugees per capita than all but one of 28 European countries, a Guardian analysis of official figures from across the continent has found. Seven million people have fled Ukraine for other European countries since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR). The Home Office put the number of Ukrainians who had arrived in the UK as of 29 May at 65,700 – equivalent to about 10 refugees per 10,000 population. As of 11 May, 720,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in Germany, which has a population of similar size to the UK’s, working out at 87 per 10,000 population. France is the only European country with a roughly equivalent per capita figure to the UK’s, with just over 57,500 arrivals as of 25 May, or nine refugees per 10,000 population – although figures from individual prefectures indicate that 93,000 have now arrived in the country, significantly more than the most recently available official figure. Some much smaller countries by population, including Austria, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria, have admitted many more refugees in both absolute and relative terms, according to their governments. Bulgaria, for example, was the initial destination for more than 290,000 people fleeing the war, equating to 423 per 10,000 population. The countries bordering Ukraine have, as would be expected, admitted many more still: UNHCR data shows that a combined 5 million refugees have entered Poland, Romania and Hungary. Poland has admitted the highest rate of Ukrainian refugees of any EU country, taking in 957 refugees per 10,000 population. While it is the case that many refugees move on to other countries, and some return to Ukraine – an Austrian official indicated that as many as 80% of arrivals had not stayed – the figures highlight the restrictiveness of the UK’s schemes, applicants to which are directed to wait for visas to be granted before they travel. The UK’s visa schemes have been widely criticised for the lengthy delays experienced by many applicants. Hundreds of Ukrainian families have chosen to withdraw their applications to come to the UK because of these delays, according to a recent Observer report.  Refugee charities have said the sponsorship scheme, called Homes for Ukraine, could be exploited by predatory hosts , though the government insists that all hosts are subject to “security and criminal checks”. While the Guardian research only considers figures for refugees arriving in each country, the UK also fares poorly in comparison with countries that publish only the number of applications for protection or asylum. Denmark and Finland, for example, have received roughly twice as many applications as the UK visa schemes per capita. The UK government’s two Ukraine visa schemes – one for Ukrainians with family in the UK, the other a sponsorship-based scheme – were launched in March. The website for the schemes shows that 144,000 applications had been received as of 30 May, and 120,000 visas issued. However, just over half that figure – 65,700 refugees – had arrived in the UK as of 29 May. A Home Office spokesperson said: “65,700 Ukrainians have now arrived safely in the UK through our two new Ukraine visa schemes and others have arrived here on other types of visas which are not shown in these figures. Together, our uncapped Ukraine family scheme and Homes for Ukraine routes are amongst the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. 120,200 visas have now been issued, showing the work we’ve done to speed up the process is working and improving daily.” They added that European countries may record refugee arrivals differently and that the figures were therefore difficult to compare directly.  The extent to which Ukrainians have been uprooted by the conflict is catastrophic: the 6.8 million people who have fled the country, combined with the 8 million people displaced internally, constitutes more than a third – 36% – of Ukraine’s total population prior to the Russian invasion. The Guardian figures represent the numbers of Ukrainian refugees arriving in the country or, where these were unavailable, the numbers who have registered as refugees or are otherwise recognised by the government as being in the country. It excludes countries that have only published figures for the number of applications by Ukrainian refugees for protection or asylum – as is the case for Denmark and Finland – and Spain, for which the only published figures date from April.

While Zelenskiy has also travelled to the US , Britain, France and Belgium , the trip to Poland stood out because it was announced in advance and undertaken without the secrecy of past foreign trips. It was also the first time that the couple had travelled abroad together since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to Marcin Przydacz, the head of the Polish president’s foreign policy office. Zelenskiy travelled through Poland on previous foreign trips, but until now had not made it his sole destination. The purpose of the journey to Warsaw was primarily to thank a country that has been an international cheerleader for Ukraine, as well as a safe haven for Ukrainian refugees and a transit hub for Ukraine-bound humanitarian aid and weapons. Zelenskiy and his wife were welcomed in Warsaw by the president, Andrzej Duda, who awarded his Ukrainian counterpart Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, the Order of the White Eagle.  ????? ???????? ????? ?? @ZelenskyyUa ?? ??????. ???? ????? ?????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? – ????? ??????????? @AndrzejDuda ?? ?????? ???? ?????? ??????????-?????. ???????? ??????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???????? ?? ?????????. pic.twitter.com/ZeujSZpavo — ????? ?????????

Poland would send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy. “Four MiG-29s that remained in storage have been handed over to the Ukrainian armed forces in recent months. Four MiGs are now being given, so eight in total. We are ready … to give six more that are currently being prepared. We assume they could be transferred soon.” Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. He said: “You have not abandoned Ukraine, you stood with us shoulder to shoulder, and we are grateful to you. We believe this is a historic relationship.” Poland has taken in more than a million Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded and has played an instrumental role in persuading other western powers to supply battle tanks and other weaponry to Ukraine. It was also the first country to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine. Zelenskiy also said he expected decisions to be announced in the coming days and weeks to alleviate anger among Polish farmers linked to Ukrainian grain imports. He told reporters at a briefing standing alongside Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, that he had discussed the matter of Ukrainian and Polish farmers at talks in Warsaw on Wednesday and found a solution. “We have found a way out, I believe that in the coming days and weeks we will finally resolve all issues as there cannot be any questions, any complications between such close partners and real friends as Poland and Ukraine,” he said. The Polish agriculture minister, Henryk Kowalczyk, resigned earlier on Wednesday amid rising anger among farmers over the impact of Ukrainian grain imports on prices. Zelenskiy will also speak to Ukrainian refugees and Polish members of the public as well as business leaders who could be involved in rebuilding Ukraine.",Broadsheet,0
1213,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,2/10/2022,593 words,Diane Taylor,Charity helping Ukrainians find UK hosts to scale back work,"A leading charity that has been helping the government with rematching Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts after initial placements end or break down is to scale back its work because it says the scheme is unworkable. Refugees at Home is one of five voluntary and community organisations listed as “recognised providers” on the gov.uk website to help match and rematch Ukrainian refugees with UK hosts. Hosting arrangements are for a minimum of six months and many are coming to an end after the scheme opened in March. As fewer UK hosts are now coming forward, rematching requests from Ukrainians are increasing. Many Ukrainian households have become homeless – around one third of them in London. According to government figures from 24 February 2022 until 26 August 2022, 1,565 Ukrainian households were registered as homeless by councils. Refugees at Home said: “We are extremely sorry that Refugees at Home is unable to help with any rematching requests under the Homes for Ukraine scheme for placements not originally made through Refugees at Home.” The statement adds: “This is due to the conditions and requirements of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. “As well as hosts and guests we have been approached by a number of local authorities who have asked us to support them in making these rematches. Regrettably we are unable to do so because of the complexities surrounding the current scheme.” The Local Government Association has also expressed concern about the housing situation for Ukrainian refugees. Its chair, James Jamieson, said councils, Ukrainians and hosts needed “certainty” about next steps. “There are concerns that more Ukrainian families may need to present as homeless as a result of a lack of sponsors or other options,” he said. “As the number of Ukrainians presenting as homeless continues to gradually rise alongside the cost of living crisis, support to sponsors may need to be enhanced to encourage new or existing hosts to sponsor in the longer term as inflation and energy costs increase,” he said. Robina Qureshi, CEO of Positive Action In Housing, which has matched more than 350 Ukrainian individuals with hosts in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland, said there were “layers upon layers of chaos” in the government hosting scheme along with a lack of strategy. “NGOs are doing what we can based on our own expertise but we are watching a ticking timebomb,” she said. Sara Nathan, co-founder of Refugees at Home, said the charity’s work for initial matches between Ukrainians and UK hosts would continue but it would only work on rematching requests from Ukrainian refugees they had made initial hosting placement for. All other rematching requests are now being turned down. In September the charity turned down 60 rematching requests. “We are concerned there doesn’t seem to be a move on strategy. We have found it very difficult to help with rematching. It’s just too bureaucratic and there’s no mechanism for one local authority to talk to another about this. There needs to be a policy to sort this out. We can’t expect local authorities to do it,” Nathan said. A government spokesperson said: “We continue to work closely with Refugees at Home and local councils to ensure families have somewhere to stay. “We are grateful to hosts for the generosity and goodwill over the last six months – and the majority of sponsors want to continue hosting. “For guests that do move on, we launched rematching in May which has been successful in finding families ongoing accommodation and we are working with councils to expand this service.”",Broadsheet,1

Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s military commander in chief, said: “Ukraine’s air force destroyed an enemy A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft and an enemy IL-22 air control centre.  I am grateful to the air force for the perfectly planned and executed operation in the Azov Sea region!” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, arrived in Switzerland to participate in the World Economic Forum in Davos and meet Swiss officials. On Sunday, Ukraine pushed ahead with its peace formula to end nearly two years of war with Russia with a meeting in Davos of national security advisers from around the world. China must be involved in efforts to end the war between Ukraine and Russia, Switzerland’s co-chair of the Davos meeting Ignazio Cassis said. Russia is mobilising about 1,000-1,100 recruits to its armed forces every day, Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency (HUR), said in an interview with RBC-Ukraine. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that Russia had probably “substantially inflated” the number of people whom it says have joined the country’s armed forces, with new recruits being disproportionately drawn from impoverished and rural communities. Russia said it had given more than 200 Ukrainian prisoners of war lengthy prison sentences, with some getting a life sentence, AFP reported. The state-run outlet RT quoted an investigative committee source as saying 242 soldiers were sentenced in occupied Ukraine. The Kremlin said Russia was developing relations with “our partner” North Korea in all areas and would build on the agreements reached between the countries’ leaders when they met at a Russian space launch centre in 2023. The UN and its partners appealed for $4.2bn (£3.3bn) from donors to support communities in Ukraine devastated by the war, as well as Ukrainian refugees, in 2024. The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, urged diplomats in Geneva: “Please do not forget Ukraine while there are many other places in the world that grab our attention.” The UK announced that it would send 20,000 service personnel to one of Nato’s largest military exercises since the cold war.

1237,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,25/3/2022,747 words,"Betsy Joles in Chi?inau, Moldova and Paula Erizanu",The poor help the desperate: Moldova struggles to aid its fleeing neighbours,"After crossing the border from Ukraine, Olga Salko spent her first days in Moldova in Talmaza, a place she calls a ""beautiful village on a hill"". It was a far cry from the horror she left behind in her husband's home town near Mykolaiv.  In Talmaza, Salko stayed with an elderly woman who volunteered to host her along with her sister, Taiyana, and her three-year-old daughter, Sophia. Salko, 36, and her family are one of many who have been welcomed into Moldovan homes, in Salko's case just hours after arriving in Chi?inau, Moldova's capital city. In the past month, Ukraine's small neighbour has received approximately 370,000 Ukrainian refugees, who have been met at the borders with acts of kindness from locals who have rallied to host and support them.  But Moldova, one of the poorest nations in Europe , is also learning how badly war relief can drain resources as conflict creeps nearer to its eastern border with Ukraine. Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, said so far, Moldova is the only country bordering Ukraine where the WFP is providing support for refugees - help that has come at the government's request. ""The capacity of the local community to continue to help these people will run out,"" Etefa said, adding that the WFP intends to give financial stipends to host families as well as food aid to refugees. Still, many fear that relief efforts will come up short if the war in Ukraine continues. Russia has advanced around Odesa, close to Moldova's border. If Odesa comes under attack, it is likely to prompt a new wave of refugees fleeing the intensifying violence. Meanwhile, experts in the region have warned that a disinformation campaign is under way, designed to spread panic among local communities. Videos in which people complain of Ukrainian refugees' ingratitude , aggression , Russophobia or wealth are being widely shared on Moldovan social media. ""It's clear that these posts are orchestrated,"" said Anastasia Nani, from Moldova's Centre for Independent Journalism. ""They look the same, use the same words and have the same messages,"" she added, bringing up a montage put together by the independent Moldovan outlet Newsmaker, which proves her point. ""There are people taking small incidents and amplifying their importance,"" said Petru Macovei of Moldova's Association of Independent Press. Valeriu Pa?a from Watchdog, a Moldovan thinktank, adds: ""We have noticed a change in the Kremlin's tactics on social media."" Russian troll farms ""are now hunting for authentic social media posts that fit their agenda and artificially making them viral"". ""A video that has 12,000 shares but only 16 comments is clearly artificially viral,"" Pa?a commented. ""Fake accounts they have created throughout the years, in the whole region, promote their narratives. You can see content with reactions from profiles from Hungary, Georgia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, who have nothing to do with the local realities spoken about in the original posts,"" Pa?a said. ""Unfortunately, Moldova has many Russian agents of influence,"" Macovei said - including politics and the media. Four of the country's 10 most watched TV channels are Russian re-transmissions with some local content. The country's Committee for Exceptional Situations has brought back a law that bans news bulletins from countries that have not ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television - including Russia. ""But the war gets represented in a distorted way even in these channels' local news programmes,"" Macovei said. Several channels were fined by Moldova's Audiovisual Council for presenting a ""unilateral"" Russian perspective on the security crisis. ""Beyond news, I also saw them broadcast a proliferation of triumphalist Soviet-era films on the Red Army,"" Nani added. Moldova's president, Maia Sandu , has asked the international community to help with the cost of hosting refugees from Ukraine. This week, the US pledged $30m (£23m) to Moldova to assist with relief efforts. The European Union earlier pledged 90m (£70m) for support in Ukraine and Moldova. Money from both will go to UN agencies and local civil society organisations. Olga Ghilca, a volunteer with Moldova for Peace, a group that started helping with relief efforts soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, says they are doing their best to prepare for more refugees but she fears an influx would overwhelm them. ""Nobody can promise that we can deal with that because we've never dealt with that,"" she said.",Broadsheet,1
1240,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,16/3/2022,450 words,Peter Bradshaw,Olga review - Ukrainian gymnast drama given fierce new focus by events,"Star Rating: 4 stars Events have lent an explosive new significance to this prophetic movie about the agony of exile from debut director Elie Grappe, which showed at Cannes last year and is now being released in UK cinemas to raise money for Ukrainian refugees. It concerns Olga, a dedicated teenage Ukrainian gymnast, excellently played by the real-life Ukrainian gymnast Anastasia Budiashkina, who herself last week arrived in Poland after escaping Kharkiv. In the movie, Olga leaves her homeland for Switzerland during the 2014 Maidan revolution to compete for the Swiss team during the European championships in Stuttgart. Her widowed mother was able to get her out to safety because Olga's dad was Swiss, and she herself is being threatened by the state for her work as an investigative journalist uncovering corruption during the pro-Russian presidency. Olga is lonely, tired, scared, reflexively suspicious of her Swiss hosts - but also a superb competitor who can obliterate all her anxieties with her fanatical commitment to work in this state-of-the-art Swiss gym. But as the tough training programme continues and Olga's tricky relationship with her sullen French- and Italian-speaking teammates gets complicated, the news comes through of how Ukraine (and her mother) are under brutal assault. Olga is wretched with remorse for leaving her friends and family for the bland safeness of Switzerland. The power, athleticism and beauty of her gymnastics now have a new choreography of guilt and rage. This is a film whose ideas and emotions have come into a fierce new focus. And there is an almost unbearable ironic flavour to the ending, which imagines a kind of emotional closure in 2020, a chastened acceptance of a precarious peace bought with bloody struggle all the way back in 2014. And the choice of Switzerland for Olga's flag of convenience is a brilliant piece of symbolism. Olga is, in her troubled way, emblematic of Ukraine's yearning for a new European identity, a peaceful and prosperous modernity and a (very Swiss) neutrality, in which its independence can be cocooned. But Olga is to see how there is also something evasive in her Swiss exile. She is mortified at the courage of the Ukrainian gymnasts when she comes face-to-face with them at the Euro championships and is convulsed with anger at the sight of one of them who has gone over to the Russians. In its unexpected way, this film speaks to the new agony of banishment now being felt by millions of Ukrainians, and to the profound unease and concern and impotence spreading westward across Europe.  Olga is released on 18 March in cinemas. For screening information benefiting the Disasters Emergency Committee click here. ",Broadsheet,0

1263,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,30/3/2022,1027 words,Robert Tait in Budapest,Hungary accused of inflating number of Ukrainian arrivals to seek EU funds,"Hungary's far-right government has been accused of inflating the number of Ukrainian refugees it is sheltering as it seeks to secure European funds to finance their welfare. Days before what will be a closely-fought general election against a unified opposition bloc, Viktor Orbn's Fidesz administration - which has previously trumpeted its hostility to those it considers illegal migrants - claimed it had accepted more refugees fleeing Ukraine than any other neighbouring country after taking Hungary's population of 9.6 million into account. Zoltan Kovacs, the government's international spokesperson, said Hungary had welcomed more than 540,000 people escaping the conflict, a figure he said amounted to between five and six refugees for every 100 Hungarian inhabitants. However, the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights NGO dedicated to helping refugees, called the statistics ""misleading"" and said most of those arriving subsequently travelled on to other countries. The number of refugees in Hungary was much lower than the official figures, the committee insisted. It also said the Hungarian government had failed to take adequate steps to inform those who had chosen to remain of their right to official protection, and added that Hungarian communication efforts paled beside neighbouring Poland and Slovakia, which has provided online forms to apply for protection. Despite the massive exodus from Ukraine, as of 27 March, according to official figures, only 7,749 people had applied for temporary protected status in Hungary entitling them to social welfare support including housing, the right to work and access to education, as required by an EU decision on how those fleeing the Russian invasion should be treated across the bloc. Mrta Pardavi, the Helsinki committee's co-chair, said the relatively low number of applicants showed many refugees were merely passing through Hungary, while others were having trouble obtaining information about their entitlements. ""How many people entered at the border does not mean anything about how many are staying longer than the time it takes to transit Hungary,"" she said. ""In reality, there are far less Ukrainian refugees staying in Hungary. ""In its quest for additional funds from the EU, the Hungarian government uses the most impressive number it can find. However, it has to provide for a far less number in reality since a high number of Ukrainian refugees move on to other countries. ""It's as if you count the number of people who go into a clothes store and then you tell the company owner that this is the number of your customers - but there's a big gap between the number who walk in and the people who actually buy things. Actually getting protected status is not made easy, you have to queue up at the immigration office and no one has received it yet."" Orban - who has declared that ""all those fleeing from Ukraine will find a friend in the Hungarian state"" - wrote to the European Commission on 18 March requesting funding from its recovery and resilience facility to help deal with the refugee inflow, which at that point he put at 450,000. No decision has been made on the application. Orban's government has been in prolonged dispute with the EU over the suspension of funding as punishment for infringements against EU rule of law procedures, with Brussels having already frozen 7bn (£5.9bn) in Covid relief funds for Hungary. Speaking to the Guardian in his office near the Hungarian parliament, Kovacs said he did not know how many refugees were in the country. ""Many of them have biometric passports, which means they have visa-free movement within the European Union,"" he said. ""We can only have a relationship with those who apply for refugee status or asylum."" In addition to those seeking protected status, another 80,000 had applied for 30-day temporary residency permits, he said. Asked to explain the gap between those figures and the much higher number of arrivals, he said: ""Many of those who have come from Ukraine are coming with the knowledge that they have relatives, friends, all over Europe and they try to spend some time with them until the war is over. ""The Hungarian state is doing everything according to what we have agreed with the united European opinion."" In a later statement, a press release issued by Kovacs' office said Hungary had provided 5.4m euros (£4.6m) in humanitarian aid within the framework of the Hungary Helps programme, with an additional 8.1m earmarked to support six charities.  It said nearly 9,500 refugees were given assistance at an emergency humanitarian transit point set up at Budapest's BOK stadium and concert hall on Monday, while 758 Ukrainian children have been enrolled in Hungarian schools and individual tutoring is being provided to help with integration.  Pardavi said some of those still in Hungary were staying in hotels at their own expense. Many had not applied for EU protected status because they were not aware of it, while those who had made applications have to wait up to 45 days for the process to be completed. In the meantime, welfare is being provided by charities and NGOs, she said. In the Czech Republic - which, unlike Hungary, already had a large prewar Ukrainian expatriate community but no border with Ukraine - authorities have issued more 242,000 temporary visas to refugees and estimate the total number inside the country at 300,000, far below the Hungarian entry figures. More than 240,000 have already registered for Czech state health insurance. The Czech Republic is also seeking European funding to help deal with the crisis. Poland has had £30bn in EU pandemic recovery funding frozen in a long-running dispute over rule of law breaches. But the country's differences with Brussels have begun to fade into the background as its humanitarian effort to help refugees and expressions of solidarity with Ukraine have earned it plaudits. Poland has so far received more than 2 million people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and the Polish government has said it will spend 2.2bn this year alone to support them. Warsaw is pressing for the pandemic funding to be released, plus other sources of EU compensation.",Broadsheet,1
1281,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,10/4/2024,724 words,Lisa O'Carroll in Brussels,EU passes asylum and migration pact after eight years of deadlock,"Sweeping changes to the EU’s migration laws have been passed in a knife-edge series of votes in the European parliament, with supporters of the new laws calling the move historic but NGOs saying they are a step back for human rights. The vote on Wednesday, which is now expected to be rubber-stamped by the member states, ends eight years of deadlock over repeated efforts to tighten up border management and asylum processes in the 27-member bloc. Champions of the laws, who had been campaigning to get the legislation passed in the face of a rise in popularity of the far right before the European parliament elections in June, seized on the move as a great victory. They said it would fast-track asylum procedures at the EU’s border, impose tough new screening systems and return people who do not qualify for international protection to their countries. Roberta Metsola, the European parliament president, wrote on X: “History made. We have delivered a robust legislative framework on how to deal with migration and asylum in the EU. It has been more than 10 years in the making. But we kept our word. A balance between solidarity and responsibility. This is the European way.” However, tensions in the huge auditorium as the voting started betrayed the deeply divisive nature of the laws. Proceedings were interrupted by protesters dressed in white T-shirts in the public gallery, who shouted at MEPs: “This pact kills! Vote ‘no’!” while throwing paper planes carrying the coordinates of shipwrecks and refugees who have died at EU external borders. The home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, who shepherded the legislation through, was defiant. “I feel proud... considering when I took office four and a half years ago, few thought we would make it,” she said. Civil society groups, however, hit out at what Eve Geddie, Amnesty International’s head of the European institutions office and director of advocacy, called a “failure to show global leadership”. “After years of negotiations, EU institutions are now shamefully co-signing an agreement that they know will lead to greater human suffering,” she said. “For people escaping conflict, persecution or economic insecurity these reforms will mean less protection and a greater risk of facing human rights violations across Europe – including illegal and violent pushbacks, arbitrary detention and discriminatory policing. Oxfam had earlier denounced the pact as a recipe for “deterrents, detention and deportation” rather than protection of human rights. MEPs on the left and the Greens, who voted against eight of the 10 pieces of proposed legislation on the table, also criticised the bill for failing to prioritise guarantees for human rights. Rightwing politicians had their own reasons for opposing the reforms, arguing that the new laws did not go far enough and would cause a spike in migration. Among those that voted against parts of the asylum and migration pact were the French and Spanish far-right parties Rassemblement National and Vox, as well as the Polish nationalist populists Law & Justice, and Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz. They had earlier denounced the 10-part pact as a licence for people-smugglers and a blow to member states’ sovereignty. The Belgian prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said parties who had tried to block the pact were voting for the status quo and leaving countries such as Italy, which has various far-right parties, to deal with the people smuggling crisis on its shores alone. The new laws must now be approved by European leaders, with opposition guaranteed from Poland’s new prime minister, Donald Tusk, who has said he will not agree to new rules allowing for relocation of migrants from countries under pressure.  “We will find ways so that even if the migration pact comes into force in roughly unchanged form, we will protect Poland against the relocation mechanism,” he said, underlining his country’s argument that is already accommodating around 1m Ukrainian refugees. Sources who worked on the legislation said every member state could opt out of the relocation of migrants with measures allowing them instead to contribute “in kind with equipment or experts such as lawyers”. In one of the most controversial measures they will also be allowed to pay €20,000 (£17,000) a head into a fund for those people they do not accept under the solidarity measure.",Broadsheet,0
1283,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,14/3/2022,775 words,Diane Taylor,Four arrested after protest at Oleg Deripaska's London mansion,"The four protesters who occupied the home of a Russian oligarch in London's Belgravia have ended their demonstration and have been arrested by police. The squatters, who said they were opposed to Vladimir Putin and Russia's invasion of Ukraine and wanted to open the mansion up for Ukrainian refugees, got into the property of Oleg Deripaska around 1am on Monday morning. Dozens of police including officers from the Territorial Support Group and a climbing team spent hours trying to persuade them to come down from a balcony at the front of the building. The group refused police negotiators' repeated attempts to ""collect"" them from the balcony using a crane, saying that they wanted to be treated in the same way as the prime minister. Referencing the ""partygate"" inquiry, they said they wanted to be sent a questionnaire to ascertain whether they had done anything wrong rather than being arrested. But on Monday evening they left the balcony. A spokesperson for Westminster police said: ""The four people protesting on the balcony of a building in Belgrave Square have come down and been arrested. A police presence will remain at the scene."" The street had earlier been cordoned off and at least 10 police vehicles and dozens of officers were on the scene. Speaking to the PA news agency over the phone during the afternoon, one of the protesters, who refused to give his name but said he was from Lithuania, said: ""All our group made peace with arrest because this was always one of the options. I'm ready to take the consequences for something I believe.""  The protesters said they felt their countries were also under threat from Putin. They said they wanted to open up the mansion - which they said ""has too many rooms to count"", including a cinema and a wine cellar - to Ukrainians fleeing the war, along with other refugees needing shelter. In a message to Russian oligarchs, the squatters said: ""You occupy Ukraine, we occupy you."" This part of London has been nicknamed ""oligarchs' quarter"" because so many wealthy Russians have bought properties in the area, a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace. Earlier, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called on the government to take action and use Russian oligarchs' empty residences to house Ukrainian refugees. He said he was ""surprised"" by the police response to the squatters. ""I'm unclear what the police were responding to because we know no one's living there,"" he told LBC's Tonight With Andrew Marr programme. ""But I'm not sure if there were concerns about any crimes being done to any neighbouring properties, so those are the questions."" Khan said that he was likely to bring up the police response with the Metropolitan police hierarchy. He added: ""One of my concerns is, we've had a number of weeks now to seize those homes, to allow them to be used by refugees. They haven't. ""I don't condone the actions of the squatters but they've decided to take the law into their own hands."" Deripaska is an aluminium magnate. He has called on Putin to make peace with Ukraine. He was among seven Russian oligarchs put under UK government sanctions last week. The squatters also criticised UK banks and parts of the establishment that they say have allowed oligarchs to launder their billions in London. They declined to say how they got into Deripaska's property but said ""it required climbing skills"" and ""squatters' magic"". ""This is not ordinary squatting, this is property liberation,"" one of the squatters said. In a statement sent to the Guardian, the squatters said the invasion of Ukraine was the latest in a long line of human rights abuses by Putin's government, including the bombing of Syria and mistreatment of LGBT people. ""This mansion will serve as a centre for refugee support for Ukrainians and people of all nations and ethnicities,"" they said. The squatters said they were invoking the spirit of Nestor Makhno, a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary. They said they would not leave the property willingly and planned to barricade themselves in if police or bailiffs tried to remove them. Before the group were arrested, a Metropolitan police spokesperson said: ""Police were called shortly after 01:00hrs on Monday 14 March to a residential property in Belgrave Square, SW1. Officers attended and found that a number of people had gained entry and hung banners from upstairs windows. Officers remain at the location."" This is not the first time squatters have occupied an oligarch's London mansion. In 2017 a group occupied the mansion of Andrey Goncharenko in nearby Eaton Square, which they said they wanted to open as a homeless shelter. Goncharenko is not currently under UK government sanctions.",Broadsheet,1

1303,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,26/4/2024,958 words,Warren Murray with Guardian writers and agencies,"Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv pulls back Abrams tanks due to drone raids and losses, says US"," Ukraine has taken American Abrams M1A1 battle tanks off the frontline, partly because of Russian drone tactics, Pentagon officials have said. The US agreed to send 31 Abrams to Ukraine in January 2023. Five have been lost to Russian attacks. The proliferation of drones means “there isn’t open ground that you can just drive across without fear of detection”, a senior defence official said on Thursday. “Now, there is a way to do it,” he said. “We’ll work with our Ukrainian partners, and other partners on the ground, to help them think through how they might use that, in that kind of changed environment now, where everything is seen immediately.” The Ukrainians have not adopted tactics that could have made the tanks more effective, one of the US defence officials said, such as in combined-arms warfare, training for which was provided by the US in Germany. Russian forces have sustained heavy losses of their own tanks and armoured equipment due to highly effective surveillance and attacks by Ukrainian drone warfare units. The US does not expect Ukraine to launch large-scale offensive operations against Russian forces in the near term, a US defence official said.  The goal was to help Ukraine’s forces “regain the initiative … In terms of what we see in the next several months of operations, Ukrainians will need to rebuild quite a bit to take on board all of these new supplies after having rationed ammunition and other supplies … and ensure that they can defend their positions”. Intense artillery, rocket and drone attacks either side of the Russia-Ukraine frontline left at least 10 people deadand more than a dozen wounded, regional officials said. Russian attacks killed at least six in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Four people were killed in Russian-occupied parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, according to Moscow-installed authorities. China must stop supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine if it wants to enjoy good relations with the west, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in Berlin on Thursday. “Last year, Russia imported 90% of its microelectronics from China, used to produce missiles, tanks and aircraft. China is also working to provide Russia with improved satellite capabilities and imaging,” he said. “China says it wants good relations with the west … They cannot have it both ways.” Stoltenberg cautioned western allies: “In the past, we made the mistake of becoming dependent on Russian oil and gas. We must not repeat that mistake with China. Depending on its money, its raw materials, its technologies – dependencies make us vulnerable.” Emmanuel Macron has warned that Europe faces an existential threat from Russian aggression and must adopt a “credible” defence strategy less dependent on the US. The French president described Russia’s behaviour after its invasion of Ukraine as “uninhibited” and said it was no longer clear where Moscow’s “limits” lay. In his almost two-hour-long speech, Macron warned that “our Europe, today, is mortal and it can die”, Jennifer Rankin writes from Brussels. Poland and Lithuania have said they are prepared to help Ukrainian authorities return men subject to military conscription, after Ukraine’s government announced this week that it was suspending consular services and the issue of passports for such men who are living abroad, Shaun Walker writes from Warsaw. “We have suggested for a long time that we can help the Ukrainian side ensure that people subject to [compulsory] military service go to Ukraine,” Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s defence minister, told the television channel Polsat. His Lithuanian counterpart, Laurynas Kasciunas, said his country may make similar efforts. “Ukraine is very short of mobilisation reserve … This is not fair to those citizens who are fighting for their country.” The Polish parliament is due to consider new regulations next week that would require all Ukrainians to show a valid passport to be able to access benefits in Poland. Previously, Ukrainian refugees had been able to do so by showing any other documents proving their identity. Kosiniak-Kamysz, the defence minister, said: “I think many Poles are outraged when they see young Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine.” Tadeusz Kolodziej, a Polish NGO lawyer, said: “The draft text we have seen would cut around 80% of benefits for people without passports … If it will be impossible to get a passport, many of these people may ask for asylum.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, said he met the UK finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, in Kyiv and called for sanctions against Russia to be tightened to stop Moscow bypassing them. France is calling for further sanctions against Russia, targeted against officials and organisations involved in attempts to disrupt elections and the democratic process in EU member states, according to a paper seen by the Guardian.

1306,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,5/9/2022,426 words,Pjotr Sauer,Moscow court revokes Novaya Gazeta’s licence to publish inside Russia,"A court in Moscow has stripped Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia, less than a year after its editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, won the 2021 Nobel peace prize. Russia’s media regulator, Rozkomnadzor, had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Speaking outside court, Muratov said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. In a separate ruling next week, a Moscow court will decide whether to also revoke the licence for Novaya Gazeta’s website. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. A number of its journalists, including Anna Politkovskaya, have been killed since the 1990s in retaliation for their reporting. In March, Novaya Gazeta said it would cease operations until the end of the war in Ukraine after it received several warnings from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. Some members of the paper’s staff fled Russia and launched a new outlet, Novaya Gazeta Europe, published from several cities in Europe. Roskomnadzor has blocked that website inside Russia, as well. Muratov, who has remained in Russia, was awarded the Nobel peace prize last October for his efforts to support journalistic freedoms in Russia. He later auctioned his 23-carat gold medal to raise money for Ukrainian refugees. In April, he was the target of a chemical attack , believed to be retribution for his anti-war stance. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on protesters, independent news outlets and foreign social media networks. In early March, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, signed off on a draconian law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military, effectively criminalising any public criticism of the war. With the closure of Novaya Gazeta, the Russian government has now blocked or shut down virtually all independent outlets in the country. The move to revoke Novaya Gazeta’s licence comes days after the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, who was widely seen as the paper’s patron. Gorbachev famously used part of his Nobel peace prize money to help set up Novaya Gazeta in 1993. On Saturday, Muratov led Gorbachev’s funeral procession in Moscow.",Broadsheet,0
1312,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,15/3/2022,1037 words,Jessica Elgot Chief political correspondent,Homes for Ukraine: what do I need to do to host refugees in the UK?,"Almost 89,000 people in Britain have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. The scheme means those who do not have a family connection to the UK can come to the country on a visa for the first time.  What do Britons who want to host a refugee have to do now?  You can host a refugee family if you live in the UK - regardless of your nationality. Non-Britons must have at least six months' leave to remain in the UK. The first step is to apply through the government website , which almost 90,000 people have already done. Applications can also be made on behalf of charities, faith and community groups or businesses. There will be some ""light-touch"" vetting of hosts, probably not a full DBS check. More detailed guidance is expected to be released in the coming days. Hosts will receive £350 a month tax free for up to 12 months, with one payment made per address, not per individual.  How will Ukrainians be matched with a British family?  The government will not be matching British hosts with Ukrainians. Those who are approved as hosts will need to identify the Ukrainians they intend to host and then they will make a visa application naming their intended hosts. However, in practice, many of those who are offering to host Ukrainians simply will not know anyone directly that might wish to come here. There are a number of charities who are asking people to register their interest with them and who can undertake some of the matching process. They include: Sanctuary Foundation - which is running online information events for hosts Refugees at Home , a charity that has experience connecting refugees and hosts online Room for Refugees , which has previously settled unaccompanied child refugees Reset , which also has a sponsorship scheme for refugees from other conflicts World Jewish Relief, which runs a number of projects in Ukraine. What will Ukrainians need to do to enter the country?  Once hosts are approved and they are in touch with a Ukrainian individual or family you wish to sponsor, they can fill in a visa application. That process is not yet open - it will start on 18 March. After a change in the rules last week, those with a valid Ukraine passport will be able to apply online. But without those documents, which many fleeing may have left behind, refugees have to visit a visa centre in other European countries, including many bordering Ukraine such as Poland, Romania or Moldova, but also in other countries like Belgium or France. There is no visa centre in Calais, despite many Ukrainians turning up at the port hoping for help to enter the UK.  What are refugees entitled to when they come to Britain?  Those who are granted a visa will be eligible to work and have the right to access state benefits and public services, such as schools and healthcare. Charities and other community organisations will be organising to help refugees access the benefits and services they are entitled to. The majority of those arriving are likely to be women and children, with men between 18 and 60 barred from leaving Ukraine in order to support the military.  What funding is available for councils?  Local authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee and more funding will be available to ensure school places for children. However, some local councils have expressed concern that further funding is likely to be needed in order to meet the needs of people likely to have experienced severe trauma and those with caring responsibilities towards children and elderly people, given that most men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine.  What do hosts have to provide for refugees?  Hosts are expected to provide a private bedroom, rather than a shared room. The government has made clear the £350 is not intended to be a full rental payment - more a goodwill gesture to cover additional costs of having a family use your home. The scheme does not expect hosts to cover food and other necessities, that should be covered by refugees themselves who will have access to the benefit systems and be able to work. However, there's nothing to stop hosts from offering food and whatever else they would like to offer.  What are the legal hurdles to hosting a family?  It's likely that councils will treat the offer of homes to refugees with compassion rather than enforcement actions but in normal circumstances there are restrictions on how people can offer homes and to how many people. Christian Fox at Becket Chambers, who said he would offer free legal advice to those seeking to house Ukrainian refugees, said that offering anything other than a room in the main home - such as an annex above a garage or a cabin or a separate flat - could create a legal ""tenancy"". ""If the owner of a second home or investment property were to allow several families to stay in a property, it may give rise to the need to register as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) under the Housing Act 2004,"" he said. ""While we might hope that local authorities would be sympathetic, unless the government scheme allows exemption, then at the very least licensing will need to be investigated with the local council and their views sought."" Fox said there were fewer legal complications for people offering a room but said it could still affect property insurance or risk breaching mortgage or lease terms, which hosts would need to clarify with their lender or landlord.",Broadsheet,1

Here's where we stand now:  A series of Russian strikes hit a residential neighbourhood in the capital on Tuesday morning, igniting a huge fire and prompting a frantic rescue effort in a 15-storey apartment building. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said five people were killed in the airstrikes on residential buildings this morning. About 2,000 cars were able to leave the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, according to local authorities. Officials said a further 2,000 cars were waiting to leave the city. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said a convoy with supplies for Mariupol was stuck at nearby Berdyansk. ? There are reports that Russian forces have taken patients and medical staff of a hospital in Mariupol as hostages. More than 100 buses carrying civilians have left the besieged city of Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine for a safe area, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. The evacuation consists of two separate convoys headed towards Poltava, in central Ukraine, ICRC spokesperson Jason Straziuso told Reuters. Talks between Russia and Ukraine resumed this afternoon, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said. On Monday, Podolyak said negotiations had taken a ""technical pause"" until Tuesday for ""additional work in the working subgroups and clarification of individual definitions"". US president Joe Biden will attend an EU summit in Brussels next week, an EU official said, according to AFP. Nearly 100 children have died in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ?Zelenskiy said in a virtual address to Canadian lawmakers.  Zelenskiy pleaded for Canada and its allies to do more to stop the Russian invasion of his country, including establishing a no-fly zone as civilian casualties mount. A woman who interrupted a live news programme on Russian state TV last night to protest against the war in Ukraine has been fined 30,000 roubles (£215) by a Russian court. Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian television producer, was found guilty of flouting protest legislation, the Russian state news agency RIA reported. Russian prosecutors have asked a court to move jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to a maximum security prison after requesting that he serve 13 years in prison on new fraud charges, AFP reported. Navalny, Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic in Russia, was jailed last year for parole violations related to charges he says were trumped up. The UK is to impose sanctions on 370 more Russian individuals, including more than 50 oligarchs and their families with a combined net worth of £100bn. More than 1,000 individuals and entities have now been targeted with sanctions since the invasion of Ukraine, with fresh measures announced against key Kremlin spokespeople and political allies of Putin, including the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu . More than 100,000 people have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first 24 hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. The website for registering interest in the scheme crashed for a short while because of the numbers offering help. An adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine was at a crossroads that could lead either to an agreement at talks with Russia or a new Russian offensive. Russia's defence ministry spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov , said on Tuesday that Russian forces had taken full control of all territory in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, Russian news agencies reported. An adviser in the Ukraine government says the war should be over by May because Russia will run out of resources to keep the invasion going. The leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia are travelling on Tuesday to Kyiv on a European Union mission to show support for Ukraine as Russia's invasion intensifies. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) says Russia has reportedly installed its own mayor in the city of Melitopol after the alleged abduction of his predecessor on Friday. Nearly all of the Russian military offensives in Ukraine remain stalled after making little progress over the weekend, according to a Pentagon briefing. Russian troops are still about 15km (9 miles) from the centre of Kyiv, a US defence official said, according to a Reuters report. Zelenskiy has used his latest address to urge Russian troops to choose surrender over the ""shame"" of continuing with the war. Speaking partly in Russian , he said the war had become a ""nightmare"" for Russia and that it had now lost more soldiers in Ukraine than during both Chechen wars combined. The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the actions of a woman who interrupted a live news bulletin on Russia's state TV Channel One on Monday to denounce the war in Ukraine amounted to ""hooliganism"". UK ministers have imposed a series of new export bans and tariffs on Russian products, the morning after the passage of the economic crime bill, intended to make it swifter and easier to target oligarchs and Russian interests. Ukraine will make a fresh attempt to deliver supplies to civilians trapped in the encircled city of Mariupol on Tuesday, the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said. Turkey's foreign minister said he expected to evacuate citizens from Ukraine's southern port city of Mariupol on Tuesday or Wednesday, he told reporters after a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. The EU has this morning formally agreed to a fourth package of sanctions, including an asset freeze and travel ban on Roman Abramovich. The full details are expected to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union later today. Abramovich, the Chelsea FC owner, is described as a ""Russian oligarch who has long and close ties to Vladimir Putin"", in a copy of the EU's legal text relating to its latest sanctions package. Boris Johnson has urged the west to end its ""addiction"" to Russian fuel as he heads for Saudi Arabia in a push for increased oil output. Almost 89,000 people have offered homes to Ukrainian refugees in the first hours of a government scheme that allows families and individuals to bring them to the UK. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder met Abramovich in Moscow for several hours last Thursday, tabloid Bild reports on Tuesday. The purpose of the Gazprom lobbyist's one-man diplomatic mission, and upon whose request it took place, remains unclear. ",Broadsheet,0
1339,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,6/3/2023,644 words,Jon Henley Europe correspondent,Estonia’s Kaja Kallas weighs up coalition options after historic election win,"Estonia’s popular centre-right prime minister, Kaja Kallas, has begun weighing options for a new governing coalition after a sweeping election victory that saw her win more personal votes than any politician in the country’s history. The centre-right leader, one of Europe’s strongest pro-Kyiv voices, said on Monday she felt “humble and grateful” for a result that showed Estonians “overwhelmingly value liberal values, security founded on EU and Nato, and firm support to Ukraine”. Kallas’s Reform party finished first in Sunday’s elections on 31.2% of the vote , giving it 37 MPs in Estonia’s 101-seat assembly, three more than in the previous parliament. Its far-right rival, the Conservative People’s party (EKRE), lost two seats, finishing second with 17. Political scientist Kristi Raik said the outcome suggested a desire for continuity reflecting both Kallas’s “strong leadership in the most serious security crisis since Estonia regained independence in 1991”, and popular dislike of EKRE’s policies. Kallas has ruled out going into coalition with the far-right party, which campaigned against additional military aid to Kyiv and called for an end to the arrivals of Ukrainian refugees and radical cuts to overall immigration to protect Estonian workers. Reform has promised to raise military spending to 3% of GDP and lower business taxes in Estonia, an EU and Nato member bordering Russia that has so far spent 1% of its GDP on military aid to Ukraine – proportionately more than any other country. Kallas said talks with possible coalition partners could begin on Tuesday. She may try to relaunch her present three-party coalition with the Social Democrats and Isamaa (Fatherland), or seek a deal with the Centre party or liberal newcomers Estonia 200. Centre won 14.7%, Estonia 200 13.5%, the Social Democrats 9.4% and Isamaa 8.3%. “We are weighing the benefits and drawbacks,” Kallas said, adding that discussion would be needed with other party leaders before formal negotiations could start. Rein Toomla, a political analyst from the Johan Skytte Institute, said it appeared that Reform could now safely exclude EKRE from the coalition building process as its “position has now become so weak that it can be easily ignored”. EKRE’s leader, Martin Helme, suggested that Reform had stolen the election, in which more than 50% of voters voted electronically. “We did everything right, and with honesty, unlike those who stole our well-deserved victory,” he said. The centre-right prime minister, whose multiple pre-war warnings about the intentions of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have boosted her international credibility, has been vocal in her demands for more western military aid to Ukraine. The Centre party, traditionally popular with Estonia’s large Russian-speaking minority, has largely supported her policy towards Ukraine and Russia – prompting a collapse in its electoral support and the loss of 10 parliamentary seats. Reform finished first in the previous 2019 elections but was then kept out of power when three smaller parties formed a government that subsequently collapsed in 2021, allowing Kallas to step in and build a new coalition. After the pre-election concerns that EKRE might outperform expectations, meanwhile, analysts said the far-right party had made a strategic error in challenging the government’s line on Ukraine and Russia. “Their main communication mistake was the sharp confrontation they sought with the armed forces, and their tactic of calling into question core tenets of national security,” political scientist Ott Lumi told the Estonian news agency ERR.  The misstep was all the stranger because EKRE prides itself on its military credentials, he said. “It seems their campaign stance, flatly ignoring their rivals’ arguments and making themselves into something of a pariah, scared potential voters off,” he said.",Broadsheet,0

1352,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,12/10/2023,796 words,Weronika Strzyzynska in Rzeszów,Far-right coalition tipped as kingmaker in Polish election,"The big political battle in Sunday’s Polish parliamentary election may be between the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, seeking a third term in office , and the opposition Civic Platform (PO) led by Donald Tusk , the former prime minister and European Council president. But with polls suggesting that neither side will have the votes to form a government outright, the decisive say in who rules Poland for the next four years could lie with Confederation, an eclectic far-right coalition of nationalists, libertarians and monarchists. As Poland enters the final days of campaigning, Confederation is polling at about 10%, which could give it enough MPs to hold the balance of power. “If there is a hung parliament, they will be the kingmakers,” said Aleks Szczerbiak, politics professor at the University of Sussex, UK. Confederation is a three-way marriage of convenience between groupings that share a radical rightwing orientation but vary considerably in their political and economic outlook. It has campaigned on a programme of low taxes, rejection of migration to Poland , and on reducing support for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees. Confederation is unlikely to enter a formal governing coalition, as this would damage its self-styled anti-establishment credentials. But analysts suggest that if PiS needs just a handful of MPs to form a government, it may seek to woo parts of Confederation, or persuade the party to prop up a minority government. Another scenario could be Confederation entering a governing pact with an opposition minority government and agreeing to pass its budget, enabling it to govern for at least a year. This could be in exchange for concessions: public appointments, constitutionally valuable parliamentary positions and a presence in public broadcasting and would be deeply controversial among many supporters of Tusk and other leftwing and liberal opposition parties. Confederation has a history of brazen antisemitism and homophobia. During the last election campaign, in 2019, Slawomir Mentzen, one of the party’s leaders, summarised Confederation’s priorities: “We don’t want Jews, homosexuals, abortions, taxes, or the European Union.” His comment was picked up by the media and nicknamed “Mentzen’s five points”. In the election seven months later, Confederation barely scraped past the electoral threshold, with 6.4% of votes. Today, Mentzen disavows the comment. The 36-year-old self-styled entrepreneur is now the TikTok-famous face of the party, and only taxes and abortion seem to remain from the original agenda. The party has released its new “five points ”, including “simple and low taxes” and “zero social benefits for Ukrainians”. A study of this year’s first-time voters showed that more than a third were planning to vote for Confederation, including 46% of men and 16% of women. On Monday, Confederation’s Krzysztof Bosak represented the party in a pre-election debate on public television, and pressed hard on anti-Ukraine and anti-migration talking points. “The border must be protected, we cannot succumb to any political correctness here. Every piece of Polish territory must be defended,” he said. The threat of Confederation scooping up anti-Ukraine votes has led PiS to take a firmer line on its neighbour recently, with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, causing waves when he announced a halt in Polish arms transfers to Kyiv. Because of the different brands of radicals and extremists under Confederation’s broad tent, the party draws support from different social groups: young voters who feel alienated from the mainstream political process, and people with extreme anti-abortion views who feel PiS has not gone far enough in reducing reproductive rights. In south-east Poland’s Subcarpathia, where many of the disproportionately poor and ageing residents are not libertarians, there is considerable support for the monarchist Grzegorz Braun, a conspiracy theorist who has a hard line on abortion and is vocally antisemitic, who won a seat on Confederation’s ticket in the last election. Other candidates are libertarians. The Warsaw businessman Michal Poluboczek, also standing for Confederation in the region, said his programme was about low taxes, small government, and self-sufficient villages generating their energy through renewable sources. Poluboczek said he was interested in “the economy, not worldviews”, adding: “The state should not furnish someone’s house.”  With the different wings of Confederation often unable to agree, their presence as part of a governing coalition, whether formally or informally, would be a wild card in Polish politics. “If they do enter a pact, Confederation would not be very loyal … They will engage in guerrilla warfare and hope to capitalise on chaos,” said Szczerbiak.",Broadsheet,0
1354,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,23/3/2023,663 words,Heather Stewart,"Climate visas could give victims of natural disasters safe route to UK, says thinktank","New climate visas should be created to allow victims of natural disasters to come to the UK, and to bring in skilled workers needed for the transition to net zero, a Conservative thinktank has argued. Onward, whose co-founder Will Tanner recently became Rishi Sunak’s deputy chief of staff, is urging the government to prepare for the likely increase in global migration as a result of the climate crisis.  The authors of the report call for the government to prioritise financial support for climate adaptation in developing countries, but also to open up new legal migration routes. “We cannot allow climate-related migration to become the defining crisis of the 21st century. The government needs to act now to build climate resilience in the most vulnerable regions on the planet and open up safe and legal visa routes for those fleeing environmental disasters,” said the report’s co-author, Ted Christie-Miller. Despite the hardline rhetoric on the illegal immigration bill by the home secretary, Suella Braverman, the authors suggest that welcoming a limited number of climate refugees would be consistent with the government’s approach. The United Nations high commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that an average of 21.5 million people were forcibly displaced each year by sudden onset extreme weather events between 2008 and 2016. Citing the UK’s recent acceptance of thousands of Ukrainian refugees and Hongkongers through bespoke visa routes, the report calls for the introduction of a natural disaster visa scheme. With major floods and droughts already becoming more prevalent as a result of global heating, the authors suggest such a route could allow for a limited number of people displaced by climate events to flee to the UK. These refugees could be permitted to stay temporarily in the UK to earn money to rebuild their lives – or potentially to remain permanently. The report does not specify how many such visas could feasibly be issued. Polling carried out for the thinktank suggests such a measure might find only limited support among the public, however: 29% of people agreed the UK has a moral obligation to host people displaced by the climate crisis, against 41% who did not. Among 2019 Conservative voters, support was just 21%, with 55% against. Separately, Onward suggests migration could form part of the answer to ensuring the UK has the skills necessary to meet the government’s target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The report recommends a new environmental resilience visa scheme, which would involve the UK establishing partnerships with climate-vulnerable countries. The authors suggest that under such a scheme, the UK would help to fund training in skills including “clean energy, construction, and disaster preparedness”, and could then allow some of those trained under the scheme to come and work temporarily in the UK. Alex Chapman, senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation (Nef), agreed that the UK has a “profound moral responsibility” to support climate refugees whose predicament was ultimately set in train by emissions from developed countries over decades.  But he said bringing in workers from developing countries was not the right solution to plugging green skills gaps. “A better approach would involve a wholesale rethink and expansion of the UK’s own upskilling system, which has been left broken and neglected. Over the course of the 20th century the UK established one of the strongest upskilling systems in the world, but successive reforms and funding cuts have seen the rate of adult participation in education crash, and our national productivity stall.” A NEF report suggested that something between 4.5m and 8.5m cumulative years of full-time training were needed to bring the UK’s workforce up to the level needed to shift the economy to net zero.

Olha Kachurenko, 43, a nurse and laboratory worker, and her 13-year-old daughter Marharyta fled their home in the southern city of Mykolaiv, not far from Russian-occupied Kherson, on 18 March, a few weeks after the war started. After reaching Poland they applied for the UK Homes for Ukraine scheme on 23 March. “We started to hear rumours that the Russians wanted to also attack neighbouring countries so we decided to try to move as far away as possible,” said Olha Kachurenko. “I opened the internet and saw information about the UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme.” Lee Mitchell, 49, a Cumbrian property developer, saw their appeal for help and offered to accommodate the mother and daughter. He said: “I have since been told I was not a suitable sponsor as a single gentleman, so arranged for them to live in a separate property that I own about 45 minutes’ drive away from my home and reapplied for their visas.” But six months after the start of the war, Kachurenko and her daughter’s visas have still not been approved. Mitchell initially funded accommodation for the family in Poland, assuming it would only be a few weeks before the visas were approved. But after weeks stretched into months it became more difficult to continue funding the accommodation, and on 30 May the family decided they had no choice but to return to their home on the ninth floor of an apartment block in Mykolaiv. “I think the UK is a very good country for Ukrainians but our visas have been delayed for a very long time,” Kachurenko said. “There are bombs all around us. I hope and pray that we will get a second chance to leave Mykolaiv and reach safety in the UK.” Mitchell said: “My grandmother came to the UK from Poland after the second world war so I feel an emotional attachment to the area. I have become close to the family and would never forgive myself if anything happened to them. I wanted to give the family some dignity by offering them a home but instead they’ve ended up back in a war zone. “They are traumatised and living in terror. The mental stress they are under is unbearable. They are desperate to get to safety and peace. I can get no help or response from the visa people. This has been going on for months. I feel it’s totally inhumane to treat these people so.” A government spokesperson said: “More than 75,900 people have safely arrived in the UK through our Homes for Ukraine scheme. It is only right we have safeguarding checks in place to ensure the safety of Ukrainians arriving in the UK.” The problems have arisen at a time when government has admitted it may have to look at alternatives to the hosting scheme to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. Government sources said: “We are currently exploring whether mass accommodation offers may be needed for emergency or longer-term accommodation.” Kate Brown, the chief executive of the charity Reset Communities and Refugees, which provides a Homes for Ukraine matching , training and support service, said: “Following the initial wave of interest in hosting people from Ukraine, we have seen a drop in the number of new sponsors coming forward. Some sponsors have postponed welcoming people during the school holidays.” She urged more people to come forward as hosts.",Broadsheet,1
1386,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,12/4/2022,638 words,Richard Partington Economics correspondent,World Bank planning to give support worth $1.5bn to Ukraine,"The World Bank is planning financial support to Ukraine worth $1.5bn (£1.2bn) to help keep critical services running as the country fights a fresh assault by Russia in Vladimir Putin's ongoing war. The bank said the funds would be used to support the continuation of key government services, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for elderly people, and social programmes for vulnerable people. In addition to $944m of emergency financing already mobilised by the World Bank, the institution said it was preparing the fresh funding to help essential government services continue to function during the war. The $1.5bn investment project financing includes $1bn of support through its International Development Association arm, as well as $472m in funding guaranteed by its International Bank for Reconstruction and Development division. Announcing the funds in a speech in Poland on Tuesday, David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, said the organisation was providing immediate working capital for companies providing critical supplies to Ukraine. ""We are working to help Ukrainian refugees as they plan their return home, help host communities as they absorb Ukrainians, and help the many millions of internally displaced persons in Ukraine who have lost their homes and livelihoods,"" he said. Founded in 1944 to help Europe rebuild after the second world war, the Washington-based organisation includes Russia and Ukraine as members. Malpass, who met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Munich on 19 February, days before the outbreak of the war, said the bank stood ""ready to help Ukraine with reconstruction when the time comes"". The head of the global development body said it was analysing the impacts of the ongoing war, including the rise in food and energy prices expected to have a severe impact for low-income countries around the world. ""[We are] preparing a surge crisis response that will provide focused support for developing countries,"" he said. The World Trade Organization has downgraded its global trade growth forecasts for the year, saying the prospects for the global economy had darkened since the war started on 24 February. With sweeping sanctions imposed by western allies in response to Putin's war, the Russian economy is expected to fall into a deep recession. A former Russian finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said the economy was set for the biggest contraction in economic output since 1994, when the country was struggling to recover from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kremlin economy and finance ministers are working on new forecasts, the RIA state news agency reported. ""The official forecast would be for more than around a 10% contraction,"" said Kudrin, who served as Putin's finance minister from 2000 to 2011, according to the report. The World Bank said last week that Russia's economy was forecast to contract by 11.2% this year , while Ukraine would suffer a plunge of 45.1% given the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war. However, the conflict is also leading to global disruption, with a sharp rise in prices for energy, fertiliser and food. Together, Russia and Ukraine account for more than a quarter of global wheat exports, with lower-income countries in the Middle East and north Africa among the biggest buyers. Malpass warned that the war in Ukraine and continuing Covid lockdowns in China were affecting the global economic recovery from the pandemic. Speaking ahead of the spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund next week, he said poorer countries would find it harder to respond to the shocks than wealthier western nations. ""The repercussions are worsening the inequality as the war affects commodity and financial markets, trade and migration linkages, and investor and consumer confidence,"" he said.",Broadsheet,1
1387,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,29/3/2022,564 words,Paul MacInnes in Vienna,Champions League places based on historical performance receive backing,"Plans to allow teams to qualify for the Champions League based on historical performance have received the backing of Europe's top clubs as the best way to ensure the competition remains ""premium"" and ""inclusive"". The changes are all but certain to be implemented by Uefa for the 2024-25 season. The influential European Club Association has developed the system as part of a process of reforming Uefa's competitions from 2024 and on Tuesday also gave its backing at its congress in Vienna to new rules regarding Financial Fair Play (FFP). The reforms, originated in a working group of ECA members and Uefa officials, will include reserving two of the 36 Champions League group places for teams who would otherwise have played in the Europa League but have a high-ranking coefficient based on previous continental performance. These two places would be awarded in addition to those based on league performance, with a maximum of six clubs entering the Champions League from any one national association. Speaking at the congress the ECA vice-president, Aki Riihilahti, said he was ""very happy"" with the proposals, which will be taken on by Uefa. More countries than ever will be guaranteed group-stage places across Uefa's three men's club competitions. ""When we're talking about the European performance spots, we added domestic performance because you have to look at the whole picture,"" said Riihilahti, who is the CEO of HJK Helsinki and sat on the working group. ""How do we have quality premium competitions which are also inclusive? When we add the domestic performance [that means] the next best is there. There's no leapfrogging. It's fair, it adds value, and overall when you look at the total picture it makes sense. As a smaller country's champion, I was very happy with the whole thing."" Also agreed in principle are new FFP rules which would see clubs competing in European football adhere to an annual cap on the money they can spend on transfers and wages. That figure is understood to be 70% of annual revenue, with the potential for fines or docked points should the level be exceeded. The previous method of calculation for FFP looked retrospectively at a club's spending and set a limit on the money any club could lose. Again, these rules are to be finalised by Uefa. The two-day meeting in Vienna showed a united front among the 247 men's clubs who are members, with plans also announced to create a membership structure for women's clubs. ECA members committed an initial 1m to assist Ukrainian refugees. Three clubs missing from the list are the remaining European Super League-supporting clubs, Juventus, Barcelona and Real Madrid. This was the first in-person gathering of the ECA since the attempted launch of the ESL last year, and the ECA's new chairman, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Paris Saint-Germain, said he did not expect a recurrence of any such breakaway. ""Today we are proving that there is a big potential in the Uefa club competitions and we don't need another system,"" Khelaifi said. ""Everyone is against it, from the fans and the media to the clubs - big and small - and [the breakaway clubs] are three only. The strange thing is that they are now enjoying playing in Uefa competitions; they are playing in the best competition. There is no potential they can do something like [revive the Super League]: we are united. In the ECA we found our unity in 2021.""",Broadsheet,0
1401,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,30/1/2024,1095 words,Charlotte Higgins in Kyiv,Of death – and laughter: how to write plays in Ukraine during wartime,"In a studio theatre tucked into a courtyard behind Kyiv’s main Khreshchatyk Street, six playwrights and six directors were hammering out a fraught question: how to write plays about war, during the war. One unexpected outcome of their workshops was: through jokes. “In Ukraine, it’s very important for people to laugh about the war. It’s a way to survive,” said playwright Oksana Grytsenko after the final session in their week-long laboratory. “If you keep on crying every day, about every lost life, you cannot live.” Three of the six drafts that writers brought to the group were comedies, said Grystenko. The plan was, at the end of the workshops, to give them staged readings in theatres in different parts of Ukraine, from Sumy in the north-east to Lviv in the west. In this session, the participants were discussing Kateryna Penkova’s comedy-drama set in a Polish hostel hosting Ukrainian refugees at the start of the full-scale invasion last year. But the play also casts back to a dark and difficult episode in Ukraine and Poland’s shared history – the Volhynia massacres , when thousands of Poles were killed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in 1943. As the writers and directors gathered in a circle for their session, the playwright-mentor overseeing the day, Lena Lagushonkova, asked Penkova to give the group an insight into the challenges she had faced when writing her text. “It took six months to write this draft and it seemed like an eternity,” said Penkova. “I wanted it to be funny and light – but still to raise certain problems. I hope it did that. After a year’s break from writing I wanted to play with my characters. I wanted that feeling of creation.” After almost two years of war, the playwrights were sensing a turning point in what they could – and should – write about. At the beginning of 2022 many stopped writing altogether: the priority was to keep themselves and their families alive. Many turned to volunteering or humanitarian work. Writing for the theatre seemed irrelevant. Then, after the first shock, scripts did get written. They tended to be quickfire documentary works, recounting stories of escape and survival, based on personal testimonies. “The problem for me, I think, was that a bunch of plays emerged at that time about great patriotic Ukrainians,” said Grytsenko after the workshop. “It was kind of therapy for us to derive strength from the fact that we survived, that we have so many great people around us. But quickly, this became a kind of kitsch.” At the same time, theatres were keen to commission morale-boosting texts. “In 2022, I received five different requests from directors for ‘something patriotic’,” said Penkova. “War has to involve a certain amount of that, and it’s normal. But it’s not really art.” “It felt like a new version of old-style Soviet realism,” added Lagushonkova. “We have not yet finished our process of decolonisation from the Soviet Union.” Now was the right time for a deeper, broader, more complex approach, said Penkova. “We believe that we have made it to the next level,” she said. “Not that there is any distance from events yet – but we can start using different angles to think about the war. The new scripts are not just preoccupied with survival, but with who we are, our identity, who we in relation to Europe, the world, and the past. And we want to think about certain things that are buried and not reflected upon.” Penkova’s own comedy-drama for example, while closely informed by her own experiences running a hostel in Poland in early 2022, is fictionalised. And it is not blandly “patriotic”. At its heart is a Ukrainian who is far from heroic. “She is a negative character, who wants to live off refugee payments and welfare,” Penkova explained. And, with its references to the 1943 massacres in Volhynia and eastern Galicia the play explores how the often fraught past relationship between Ukrainians and Poles resonates in the present. The broadening of approach away from verbatim, testimony-based work also accounts for the emergence of comedies among the plays the writers have brought to the group. And, in Grytsenko’s case, for the introduction of a hint of the surreal. Her draft is a comedy about Ukraine’s statues of the poet Alexander Pushkin and other Russian historical figures, many of which are in the process of being removed from the country’s squares and parks under new decolonisation laws. In her play, the statues rise up and march towards Crimea in order to protect the peninsula and the “ Russkiy mir ”, or Russian political and cultural space, from the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Another workshop participant, Olha Matsiupa, is working on a dystopian comedy, in the style of a western, set in a postwar Ukraine dominated by women. Despite these non-documentary approaches, the writers have, they said, been reflecting deeply on their responsibility to the truth. As an example of how not to write a script, Penkova said the group had cited Yurik, a Ukrainian feature film set in Mariupol released earlier this year. It received a barrage of criticism for creating a false impression of the conditions during the siege of the city. The fictionalised story, which was described as “based on true events”, was criticised for showing inhabitants with phone signals and electric light, when in reality power and signal had been nonexistent. It was also accused of wrongly implying there were safe humanitarian corridors for evacuation. The inaccuracies were regarded as tantamount to gaslighting those who really had suffered the trauma of existence under the Russian bombardment and siege of the city last spring. Even when inventing characters, “the plays have to be based on profound research”, said Penkova. That often means gathering stories from those who have been witnesses to terrible events. During the summer, the playwrights attended sessions with a psychologist on how best to speak to traumatised interviewees. “At this stage, journalism and playwriting go hand in hand,” said Lagushonkova. Grytsenko herself also writes journalism. But the playwriting process is very different from reporting, she said. “If I write a story for a newspaper about a person, I of course think about this person, but I have kind of border between me and my source. “When I do a play, on the other hand, I need to get into the skin of the person – to even become the person.” As to the central question of how to write a play about the war, during the war: “There is no exact recipe,” said Penkova, “but it has to be honest, it has to be specific, and it has to be truthful.”",Broadsheet,0
1410,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,30/12/2023,958 words,Amelia Gentleman,‘I feel peaceful here’: how a charity found a welcoming home for a homeless refugee,"On a dark December afternoon, Frieda Schicker and Robel, the Eritrean refugee she has been hosting for the past two months, are squabbling about who should be relaxing on the sofa and who should be making cups of tea. “He thinks I’m too old to make tea, and he doesn’t like being served,” Frieda says as Robel tells her: “I’ll do it. Let me do it.” She insists on boiling the kettle herself, making him sit down and rest after a tiring day studying construction at a local college. It has been years since Robel lived in a family home and he is slowly reacclimatising. “I’m taking a breath, trying to prepare myself for what comes next,” he says, stroking Frieda’s cat. “I feel peaceful here.” “Try not to mumble when you’re talking,” Frieda says, kindly chiding him, thinking about how he will come across when he starts being interviewed for jobs. A room in this warm, welcoming home represents a potentially life-changing piece of good fortune for Robel, who in early October was sleeping rough in a north London park. He hadn’t managed to source a tent or a sleeping bag and was wearing several layers of clothes to keep warm. Most passersby ignored him or quickly averted their eyes, but one woman stopped to ask if he needed help. He explained that he had recently been granted refugee status, after two years spent waiting for a Home Office decision. He had been swiftly issued with an eviction letter from the Home Office accommodation where he had been housed for 24 months, but with no job and no money for a deposit to rent somewhere he found he had nowhere to go but the local park. Council staff were meant to offer help but they never returned his calls and seemed overwhelmed. The woman told him to contact Refugees at Home , one of three charities the Guardian and Observer are supporting this year for our refugee and asylum seeker charity appeal, along with British Refugee Councils and Naccom (the No Accommodation Network). Within days he was linked up with Frieda and invited to move into one of her grownup children’s long-abandoned bedrooms. The charity, which matches homeless refugees with hosts, is under unprecedented pressure after a Home Office policy change in August in effect dramatically reduced the time asylum seekers are given to find new homes once granted refugee status. Thousands were made homeless and destitute in recent months as a result. (The policy was quietly reversed in late December.) “I don’t have the words to describe. There’s a sense of panic everywhere,” says Carly Whyborn, the charity’s interim executive director, at the charity’s Brixton headquarters. “Every day we have desperate people on the phone.” In November 2022 the charity placed 78 non-Ukrainian refugees with hosts (Ukrainians are housed under a different scheme); this November it placed almost four times as many. On the day I visit, there are 53 new referrals who need homes, most of them from Sudan, Iraq, Iran or Afghanistan, and staff are checking references, discussing which hosts might best suit which refugees. Computer files indicate that the charity has 698 approved hosts, but not all of them are available immediately and many are in parts of the country where there is little demand. “We’d give our back teeth for new hosts in Brighton, Hastings, Manchester, South Yorkshire,” Whybourn says. “We spend time getting it right, it’s not just putting two random people together,” she adds. “We ask what they love, what they don’t love. We have to make sure that the match works.” The charity doesn’t ask about the refugee’s journey to the UK or the grounds for their asylum application. “We’re not the Home Office.” After Robel got in touch with the charity, Whybourn asked him to send in two references. One came from a member of staff at the Home Office hotel who described how much Robel had helped younger asylum seekers during his time there. “It was one of the most glowing references you could get,” she says. Asked to describe his hobbies, Robel wrote: “I enjoy watching football, and films in my spare time, I’m eager to meet new people and I’m very friendly.” Whyborn knew Frieda and her husband had already successfully hosted eight refugees over the past three years, and was hopeful they would welcome another. “They have a really good understanding of what refugees need. Frieda said yes straight away.” In Robel’s case, what he needed most of all was to sleep, to recover from the recent ordeal of living in a park, and from a deeper exhaustion caused by years spent searching for sanctuary. Once he had recuperated, he signed up to two college courses, and he began offering to cook Eritrean meals for Frieda and her husband (they appreciated the gesture, but admit being startled by the intensity of the spices). Frieda’s father was a refugee who fled Austria in 1938, and this helped prompt her to volunteer with the charity. “This country has always had people coming from elsewhere; they’re usually the more dynamic people. You need a lot of courage and initiative to get this far,” she says. “I feel like I’m helping people who are going to contribute an enormous amount.” The arrangement was due to last two months but has been extended to allow Robel a bit more time to find work and somewhere permanent to live. He is hesitant about his future, saying he feels too old to have real dreams or ambitions and just wants to find someone who will employ him. Having a home and, crucially, an address while he makes that happen is crucial. “Frieda understands how it is for us,” Robel says. “I felt good as soon as I arrived.” Donations can be made online by credit card, debit card or PayPal , or by phone on 0151 284 1126.

We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv to mark the the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. The US has announced that it will offer over $10bn in assistance to Ukraine.   The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education and emergency services”. Washington has also announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement, the Biden administration said it would include “several new unmanned aerial systems (UAS), counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression”. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine, prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced. He said Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion. The EU Commission vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, said “as far as [refugees from] Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being”, referring to a potential increase in refugees. The US Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, pledged American solidarity with Ukraine. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism and valour personified by President Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people,” the Democrat said. The Group of Seven has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. It promised measures against Russian diamond exports, warning that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs”. The G7 is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of its sanctions already imposed. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. A “people’s court” has endorsed an indictment against Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible”, AP reported. Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – as well as of Crimea.

1413,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,27/3/2022,648 words,Editorial,The Guardian view on Putin and the world: it's not just about China,"When Vladimir Putin recognised Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics, days before his invasion of Ukraine, one of the most powerful denunciations came from Kenya's envoy to the UN. Martin Kimani cited his country's own history as he warned against irredentism and expansionism: ""We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression,"" he said. On two general assembly resolutions - the first denouncing the invasion, the second blaming Russia for creating a humanitarian crisis - 140 or more nations have approved. Only four have voted with Russia to oppose them: a rogues' gallery of Belarus, Eritrea, Syria and North Korea. Yet widespread condemnation, along with the west's unexpected unity, should not be mistaken for Russian isolation. Having boasted of a relationship with ""no limits"", and sharing a common interest in countering the global might of the US and Nato, China is now seeking to portray itself in a more nuanced light and avoid economic and political damage - but is not, in reality, distancing itself from Russia. Beijing is not alone. Few of the world's most populous nations, and only a few leading players outside the west, have assailed Mr Putin. Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, was in Moscow as the tanks rolled into Ukraine. India, which has a longstanding strategic relationship with Russia and high anxiety about its ties to both Pakistan and China, has discussed a ""rouble-rupee"" swap to help Moscow beat western sanctions. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro - courted by Mr Putin - even sees the war as a ""good opportunity"" to encroach on indigenous land in search of materials for fertiliser.  Russia's influence in and dealings with the Middle East have expanded substantially since its decisive role in the Syrian war, leaving many countries hedging their bets, in the midst of a broader realignment of the region. Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, recently refused to take Joe Biden's call - a week after speaking to Vladimir Putin. The UAE said no to a call too. It voted against Russia at the UN general assembly , where votes are non-binding and largely symbolic, but abstained in a similar vote at the security council, which would have had more weight. South Africa initially called for the withdrawal of Russian troops, but then blamed Nato expansion for the war. Sixteen other African nations joined it in abstaining in the first general assembly vote thanks to growing economic ties , as well as a long-established position of non-alignment and the Soviet Union's support for liberation movements. The war has triggered, not caused, a dramatic new phase in the long-term reshaping of our world. Trumpism has done more than China's growing might to accelerate perceptions of US decline. Selective compassion and double standards have increased suspicion and rancour. Another illegal war - Iraq - looms largest. But many also note the contrast between the welcome outpouring of concern for Ukrainian refugees in Europe and widespread indifference or hostility to those fleeing other wars. Russia's use of cluster munitions is rightly condemned, but Mr Biden has yet to reverse his predecessor's decision to axe a ban on their use. Kenya's righteous criticism of Russia's aggression came with a pointed addendum: a condemnation of ""the trend in the last few decades of powerful states, including members of this security council, breaching international law with little regard"". Mr Putin's current position reflects not only his willingness to aid unsavoury regimes, and his malign interference around the world, but also the sins and failures of the US and the west. To address these is not a hopelessly idealistic endeavour, but one of necessary realism, if we are to forge the powerful alliances needed against cruel acts of aggression.",Broadsheet,0
1426,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,20/8/2022,672 words,Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent,Gibraltar prepares for first auction of a Russian oligarch’s detained superyacht,"A £65m superyacht of a Russian oligarch hit by sanctions will be auctioned off by the Gibraltar government on Tuesday, becoming the first of the luxury vessels to be sold off since restrictions were imposed on hundreds of rich Russians after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the 72.5-metre Axioma is not being sold for the benefit of the Ukrainian people but for a US investment bank, JP Morgan, which claims the yacht’s billionaire owner, Dmitry Pumpyansky, owes it more than $20m (£17m). The vessel, which features six luxurious guest cabins, a swimming pool, a 3D cinema room, gym, jacuzzi and a fully equipped spa, was detained after docking in Gibraltar in March. Pumpyansky, who until March of this year was the owner and chairman of the steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, a supplier to the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom, was subjected to sanctions by the UK, EU and the US after the invasion of Ukraine. The UK said the billionaire, who it said had built up an estimated £1.84bn fortune, was one of the oligarchs “closest to Putin”.  While dozens of superyachts suspected of being owned by oligarchs under sanction have been detained or confiscated across the world, Axioma is the only one that has been put up for sale. However, the proceeds will not be paid to the people of Ukraine. The UK and other governments have suggested the sanctioned oligarch’s assets could be seized and used to assist Ukraine refugees.  However, in this case, the yacht was detained by the Gibraltar government after a legal claim from JP Morgan, which said Pumpyansky’s holding company Pyrene Investments owed it more than $20m. JP Morgan said the fact the billionaire had been subjected to sanctions meant the terms of the loan had been breached because it legally could not accept loan repayments from Pyrene, and asked the Gibraltar courts to detain and sell the yacht. A spokesperson for Gibraltar Courts Service said: “The Axioma was arrested following the filing of an admiralty claim in the supreme court. Given that the sale is by auction, pursuant to an order of the court, the Admiralty marshal cannot say how much it is expected to sell for or how many people have expressed interest.” A JP Morgan spokesperson said: “We will politely decline comment on the Axioma matter.” The bank did not respond to questions about whether it would donate any of the money from the sale to Ukrainian refugees but the spokesperson said: “JP Morgan expanded a philanthropic commitment of $5m to $10m to help support worsening refugee crisis in Ukraine.” Pumpyansky could not be contacted for comment. Nigel Hollyer, the broker to the Admiralty marshal of the supreme court of Gibraltar, is leading the auction. He said there had been an “unexpected late surge by prospective buyers” and more than 30 had flown to Gibraltar to inspect the yacht in person. “They are people from across the world,” Hollyer told the Guardian. “They are people who own or have owned boats of similar size, and have been attracted to this boat because of the judicial sale process – they are convinced they’re going to get a bargain.” He said more potential buyers are booked in to see the boat across the weekend, and on Monday morning before the sealed bids auction closes at 1pm Gibraltar time on Tuesday. The yacht, which was designed by the famed superyacht designer Alberto Pinto, was built by Dunya Yachts in Turkey in 2013. The boat, which was originally named Red Square before being renamed Axioma, was available for other millionaires to charter for $558,500 a week. “With its luxurious interiors, vast array of onboard facilities and a highly trained and professional crew, a luxury yacht vacation onboard motor yacht Axioma promises to be nothing short of spectacular,” the charter listing states.

The entertainment group said on Thursday it will pause all business there, including content and product licensing, Disney Cruise Line activities, National Geographic magazine and tours, local content productions and its live television channels. ""Given the unrelenting assault on Ukraine and the escalating humanitarian crisis, we are taking steps to pause all other businesses in Russia,"" the company said. Disney said some businesses would take time to pause due to contractual nuances. The company had earlier said it would halt the release of theatrical films in Russia. Fellow Hollywood studios Warner Bros and Sony Pictures Entertainment had also decided on such a move last month. Earlier on Thursday, the Japanese retailer Uniqlo suspended its Russian operations in a U-turn after pressure to take action. Earlier this week Fast Retailing, the clothing chain's owner, said it intended to keep its Russian shops open because clothing was a ""necessity of life"", even as a string of brands, from McDonald's and Starbucks to Burberry and Asos , suspended operations in Russia. On Thursday, Fast Retailing issued a statement saying it was also suspending its operations as it had ""recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation"". The company said it still believed making ""everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia"" was part of its mission but it had become clear it could no longer continue to do so because of the difficulties involved.  Fast Retailing previously announced a donation of $10m (£7.6m) to the UN refugee agency UNHCR to help people fleeing Ukraine. It also said employees in Europe had been helping to deliver clothing to refugees. A number of brands have indicated they will be scaling back their operations in Russia rather than pulling out of the country because of their complex business arrangements there. Burger King said it had suspended marketing and supply chain support to its franchisee in Russia and would be refusing approval for investment and expansion. The fast food group said any profits from franchised operations would be allocated to humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees . The British beauty brand Lush said on Thursday that it had suspended supply to its Russian licensee and stopped online sales in the country. It is also in the process of buying out its licensee in Ukraine to secure the future of the business. Lush has 48 shops in Russia and 15 in Ukraine, and these employ more than 600 people. Its stores in Russia are continuing to operate and the company said it was ""not in a position to dictate whether they are open or closed. They are governed by longstanding legal agreements that are not easily changed."" Mondelez, the owner of Cadbury chocolate, Oreo biscuits and Philadelphia soft cheese, is ""scaling back all non-essential activities"" in Russia but will continue to supply basic foods and support local staff. The firm said it would suspend advertising spending and all new capital investments. On Thursday, Sony and Nintendo said they had also halted shipments of gaming consoles and games to Russia. Taylors of Harrogate, the makers of Yorkshire Tea, also confirmed that it was pulling out of the country. ""While Russia has been an export market for some of our teas for several years, as a result of the invasion and the subsequent sanctions, we've suspended trade,"" a spokesperson said. Later the same day, Goldman Sachs became the first Wall Street bank to close its operations in Russia in response to the invasion. The money transfer giant Western Union also said it would be suspending operations in Russia and Belarus. The owner of KFC and Pizza Hut said on Tuesday evening that it was halting the operations of 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalising an agreement to suspend all 50 Pizza Hut outlets in partnership with its master franchisee. On Wednesday, Mothercare, Heineken, the UK tobacco firm Imperial Brands and Universal Music Group joined the exodus. Unilever, which owns Marmite and Ben & Jerry's, said it had suspended imports and exports to Russia but continued to supply to local people essential food and hygiene products made in Russia.",Broadsheet,0

In Israel, it is usually celebrated with family visits and food: traditionally, apples dipped in honey are eaten to symbolise hopes for a “sweet” year ahead. For followers of the rabbi Nachman of Breslov, however, Rosh Hashanah is a chance to party. Nachman, a great-grandson of the founder of what is today broadly known as Hassidic Judaism, a branch of ultra-Orthodoxy, spent the final months of his life in the Ukrainian city of Uman, 125 miles (200km) south of Kyiv, and died in 1810. In 1941, the Germans deported the entire Jewish community in Uman, murdering 17,000 Jews and destroying the local Jewish cemetery, including the burial place of Nachman, which was eventually recovered and relocated. About 1 million Ukrainian Jews were killed in the Holocaust. More than 200 years after Breslov’s death, the sect still makes pilgrimages to his tomb on Rosh Hashanah, when it is believed those who pray over it will be atoned for their sins. Today the celebrations often involve loud music, trance-like dancing and heavy use of alcohol and drugs. Ukrainian police on Friday arrested four Israeli nationals suspected of drug possession at a crossing point outside the western Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, Ynet reported. “Many come here to pray,” says Natan Ben Noon, the chief rabbi of Uman. “But I assure you that 80% of the visitors are not religious. They come here just to have fun.” Each year it is as if an ultra-Orthodox slice of Jerusalem had been transported to the quiet city of Uman, with its population of 80,000. The streets are filled with shops that gladly accept payments in shekels, men are dressed in long black coats or white prayer robes, and advertisements and street signs are written in Hebrew. However, before turning on the techno music, at midday it is time to gather in prayer on the street for the Tikkun HaKlali (the general remedy), with thousands of worshippers reciting in unison a set of 10 verses from the Psalms. Israeli and Ukrainian officials pleaded for worshippers to stay away this year. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is also Jewish, spoke last week in a conversation in which the Ukrainian leader made it clear that there were “not enough shelters in Uman for local residents, let alone foreign tourists”. The city was last hit by Russian missiles in June, while in April 23 civilians were killed , including three children, after more than 20 long-range Russian missiles struck a residential neighbourhood. “Israeli citizens who are travelling to Ukraine need to act responsibly regarding their trips at this time,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “God hasn’t always shielded us, especially in Europe … It must be understood that in Israel, when missiles fall on us, citizens enter shelters and there is protection. There, there are no shelters and no protection.” Despite the warnings, as of Wednesday more than 35,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Uman, the majority from Israel, and others from France and the US. “In Israel, we are used to situations like these,” said Rabbi Ben Noon, who moved to Uman from Israel in 1988. “And I think this is also an opportunity for Ukraine. It’s important for them to show the world they are in control of the situation and that the show must go on.” “I come from a city near Ashdod – do you think we don’t know what it means to live in a war zone?” said one of the pilgrims, Ohad Ginzburg, 31. “We have air raid alarms too. I don’t take sides in this war. Ukraine says lies about Putin, and Putin says lies about Ukraine. It’s none of my business.” The vast majority of pilgrims are men, often accompanied by their children, some as young as three years old. Chaya Sadon, 29, from a town near Tel Aviv, was one of the very few women. “It’s really exciting to be here,” she said. “Last year, there was still a war, yet nothing happened. We are not coming here with no purpose. We came here to stay in a holy place.” Ukraine’s Centre for Countering Disinformation this week used Telegram to expose what is said was false information being spread by Moscow that Ukraine was preparing a terrorist attack in Uman, for which it would then blame the Russians. The arrival of thousands of Jewish pilgrims in Ukraine does not help the Kremlin’s propaganda, which has persistently claimed the need to “denazify” the country since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, Ukrainian authorities fear that Russian saboteurs could infiltrate the crowds and intentionally create problems to then blame Kyiv. Approximately 1,000 law enforcement officers have been deployed and an additional 24 bomb shelters set up to ensure the safety of the pilgrimage. “It’s a problem,” says Alexander Khmara, a 34-year-old Ukrainian Jew and member of the Magen Ukraine, a community group that coordinated with regional police to patrol the streets. “We’ve set up a checkpoint at the entrance of the main road. We are here to check every individual coming in and out. And to monitor that there are no individuals among the visitors with the intention of provoking the crowd and then saying: ‘See, the Ukrainians are Nazis.’” This year’s Rosh Hashanah celebrations in Uman come after a diplomatic spat last month in which Ukraine’s ambassador to Israel accused the Jewish state of deporting Ukrainian refugees and denying Ukrainian nationals entry. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian and Russian nationals have sought shelter in Israel since the war began.",Broadsheet,0

Poland in particular is bracing for various scenarios if Moscow invades Ukraine, according to its deputy interior minister, Maciej Wasik. ""We have to be prepared for a wave of up to a million people,"" he told Polish radio. Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians , many of whom have moved since the 2014 conflict and taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. Last Saturday, Krzysztof Kosinski, the mayor of Ciechanów, a town in north-central Poland, said on Twitter he had been asked by authorities to indicate ""the list of accommodation facilities for refugees, the number of people it would be possible to accommodate, the costs involved and the time for adaptation of buildings with a recommendation of up to 48 hours"". It is hard to say how many Ukrainians would flee a potential conflict. Many people from the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine have already left for other parts of the country or for Russia, while others have left the country in search of better-paid work. ""Because we now have visa-free travel with Europe, people who wanted to leave have already done so,"" said Ukraine's finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, in an interview in Kyiv. ""If Russia escalates and people decide to go to Europe to find a safer place, it's likely to be a smaller portion of people,"" he said. However, there are many different scenarios of how a Russian invasion may unfold, and if the warnings from US and British intelligence of a fully fledged invasion and drive to Kyiv by the Russians come to pass, it seems unlikely to be without huge casualties and displacements. ""We are following the situation very closely; however, the situation remains unpredictable,"" said Natalia Prokopchuk, a communications and advocacy officer for UNHCR in Europe. ""In the meantime, the UN and its humanitarian partners in Ukraine hope that the ongoing tensions will not escalate and will be resolved through diplomatic and political means among all concerned parties,"" she said. Other countries in eastern Europe are preparing for a potential influx of refugees if Russia attacks Ukraine. Romania's interior minister, Lucian Bode, told TV B1 its government was considering the prospect of ""hundreds of thousands of refugees in an uncontrolled influx"". ""We are currently analysing how many refugee camps we can install in a relatively short time: 10, 12, 24 hours. We are analysing existing lodging capacities in border counties but we are also discussing the second stage, with neighbouring counties, and the third stage across the country,"" he said. Slovakia's interior minister, Roman Mikulec, said his government also stood ready to play a part. Rights groups have welcomed countries' willingness to help, but some drew comparisons with the treatment of other refugees, in a part of Europe where politicians have often played on anti-refugee sentiment. After the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, organised the movement of refugees with the promise of a safe passage to Europe last year, thousands of people were caught by Polish border guards in the forests near the border and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus. Late in January, Warsaw announced it has started building a 353m (£293m) wall along its frontier with Belarus, aimed at preventing Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers from entering the country. A spokesperson for the Ocalenie Foundation, which supports refugees living in Poland, commended the commitment, but said it showed a double standard. ""We wonder why they didn't do any moves like that during the crisis on the border. This shows a general trend that in Poland some asylum seekers are favoured over others,"" said the spokesperson. Wasik described Ukrainians as ""real refugees"" in need of help and added that his government ""absolutely won't say no to helping them, in line with the Geneva conventions"". Grupa Granica, a Polish network of NGOs monitoring the situation on the border with Belarus, said in a statement: ""For almost half a year the same government has violently pushed back people from many other countries trying to cross through Belarusian border. It is racist to differentiate people and their access to basic migration procedures based on the country of their origin. Why don't they have access to the same treatment?"" In the meantime, authorities in the self-declared Luhansk and Donetsk people's republics have ordered an evacuation ostensibly to protect citizens from a planned Ukrainian attack, although there is no evidence Kyiv is planning any such thing. According to observers, the move appears designed to create a pretext to launch a Russian intervention.",Broadsheet,1

France's president, Emmanuel Macron, warned against the use of inflammatory language in an already volatile situation, while the Kremlin said the ""personal insults"" further undermined relations between the US and Russia. Biden's ad-libbed remarks on Putin's leadership , made during a speech in Poland on Saturday, were taken by many as a call for the Russian president to be overthrown. As Russia launched symbolic missile strikes on the Ukrainian city of Lviv, 40 miles from the Polish border, Biden said Putin was ""bent on violence"", adding there was ""simply no justification or provocation for Russia's choice of war"" in Ukraine. He continued: ""For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power."" The president's comments were swiftly walked back by both the White House and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who insisted the US did not have ""a strategy of regime change in Russia - or anywhere else"". Macron said on Sunday that he would not have used Biden's words, adding that he saw his task as ""achieving first a ceasefire and then the total withdrawal of [Russian] troops by diplomatic means"". He told broadcaster France 3: ""If we want to do that, we can't escalate in either words or actions."" Minutes after Biden spoke, the White House scrabbled to clarify his meaning, saying the president ""was not discussing Putin's power in Russia, or regime change"". According to one official, the speech was not a call to topple the Russian president, but rather an attempt to prepare the world's democracies for an extended conflict. Blinken was even more emphatic when he addressed the issue during a visit to Jerusalem on Sunday. ""I think the president, the White House, made the point last night that, quite simply, President Putin cannot be empowered to wage war or engage in aggression against Ukraine or anyone else,"" he said. ""As you know, and as you have heard us say repeatedly, we do not have a strategy of regime change in Russia - or anywhere else, for that matter."" Earlier on Saturday, Biden had been asked what seeing Ukrainian refugees at Stadion Narodowy had made him think of as he deals with Putin. He replied: "" He's a butcher."" Julianne Smith, the US permanent representative to Nato, told CNN that Biden's words were ""a principled human reaction to the stories that he had heard that day"". But she also stressed the US ""does not have a policy of regime change in Russia - full stop"". However, Senator James Risch, ranking Republican on the senate foreign relations committee and a member of the senate intelligence committee, said Biden had made a ""horrendous gaffe"" and created ""a huge problem"" when he went off-script. ""I think most people who don't deal in the lane of foreign relations don't realise that those nine words that he uttered would cause the kind of eruption that they did,"" Risch told CNN. ""But any time you say or even as he did suggest that the policy was regime change, it's gonna cause a huge problem. This administration has done everything they can to stop escalating. There's not a whole lot more you can do to escalate than to call for regime change."" The Russian government said Biden appeared to have lost his cool, adding that it was not up to the US president to determine who ruled Russia. ""A state leader should control his temper,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the state news agency Tass. ""Personal insults like this narrow the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current [US] administration. It is necessary to be aware of this."" The Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska said Biden's speech suggested some sort of ""hellish ideological mobilisation"" was under way that may usher in a much longer conflict in Ukraine. Richard Haass, the veteran American diplomat and president of the US Council on Foreign Relations, said Biden's words had been counter-productive and damaging. ""The comments by @potus made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous,"" Haass wrote on Twitter.  Tobias Ellwood, the British MP who serves as the chair of the Commons defence select committee, said the comment had been ""unwise"" and would be seized on by Putin. ""It's for the Russian people to draw this (obvious) conclusion,"" Ellwood wrote on Twitter. ""Putin/Xi (& many Russians) will now read 'regime change' as POTUS' wider objective - beyond supporting Ukraine. Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder."" Nadhim Zahawi, the British minister for education, told Sky News the Russian people would ""decide the fate of Putin and his cronies"". Asked whether Biden had been wrong to say what he had, the education secretary said: ""The president gave a very powerful speech on this and I think both the US and the UK agree that it's up to the Russian people to decide who should be governing them.""",Broadsheet,0

In an effort to force Ukraine to negotiate peace, Russia has been trying to destroy the country’s energy infrastructure with a series of mass strikes.  More than 6 million Ukrainians, left without heating and electricity, are being plunged into extreme hardship and a long period of blackouts is looming. The World Health Organization has said the destruction of houses and lack of access to fuel or electricity “could become a matter of life or death”. On 13 December, 70 countries and institutions pledged more than €1bn (£860m or $1.05bn) in immediate aid to help Ukraine get through the coldest season, with £415m devoted to Ukraine’s energy sector, hammered by Russian airstrikes. “Since Ukraine has got back on top on the ground, Russia, whose military weaknesses have been exposed, has adopted a cynical strategy that targets civilian infrastructure to bring Ukraine to its knees,” said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who hosted the global meeting in Paris to discuss what could be offered to maintain water, food, energy, health and transport during Ukraine’s winter. ‘‘For each of your country’s victories on the ground, Russia’s cowardly response is to bomb power, gas or water infrastructure necessary for the people’s survival this winter,” he said. The latest package of military aid sent by Nato to Ukraine, in addition to weapons, fuel and medical supplies, includes winter equipment and winter clothing , while the European Commission is providing temporary cold-weather shelters, generators and electricity grid-repair kits to help tide them over the coming winter. “We are encouraging member states to put enough resources in place to face these increased needs,” the EU crisis management commissioner, Janez Lenarcic, said. Last month, the EU’s assembly and Eurocities, a network of more than 200 cities in 38 countries, launched a campaign to donate power generators and transformers to keep the power on at essential facilities, including hospitals, schools, water supply facilities, relief centres, shelters and mobile phone masts. “We urged national, regional and local leaders to join forces to provide emergency support for Ukraine’s regions and cities in the face of Russia’s efforts to leave Ukrainians without homes, heating, electricity and water this winter,” the European Committee of Regions said in a statement. Hundreds of thousands of homes in Ukraine have been destroyed by the Russians. Many were razed to the ground; others were partially damaged. In some houses, it was still possible to live there during the summer and partly in the autumn, but with winter approaching it is impossible. During the winter months, Ukraine has average temperatures of between -4C and 2C. In some regions, temperatures regularly drop to -21C. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has announced the UK will provide winter kits to the Ukrainian armed forces as “they defend their country in gruelling winter conditions”. By the end of December, the UK is expected to deliver 12,000 sleeping kits, 150 heated tents, more than 25,000 sets of extreme cold-weather clothing and 7,000 sets of normal cold-weather kits – each of which normally contains more than 40 items, including a set of winter clothes, sleeping bags for use in up to -30C, special underwear, and “tactical socks” to help soldiers avoid trench foot. The Spanish foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, said in November his government had dispatched 14 generators , while Norway has sent a package that includes 55,000 items of winter clothing.  “We are trying to deliver it as quickly as possible,” the Norwegian defence minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, said. “The cold season is approaching very quickly.” Germany has said it will deliver a new €11m (£10m) package of assistance, including 183 generators, 116,000 winter jackets, 80,000 winter trousers and 240,000 winter hats. Japan also responded to Ukraine’s request for help , extending an emergency grant aid of approximately £2m as support for winter assistance – with provision of generators and solar lanterns. The UNHCR has launched a fundraising campaign to help Ukrainian refugees survive the winter season, as millions of people are facing their first winter away from home. “UNHCR teams are on the ground providing winter supplies, emergency cash assistance for the most vulnerable, and helping reinforce homes and shelters against the harsh weather,” it said in a statement. Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee have started to scale up their responses by distributing essential winter items, including blankets and heaters. “With no power source and with damage to their shelter, surviving the winter will be incredibly difficult for a large number of people,” said the IRC’s Ukraine country director , Marysia Zapasnik. “It could also result in a dramatic increase in the number of displaced people, as they move to other parts of the country in search of warmth.” In addition to institutional systems and charities, there are also millions of people who are contributing aid independently, donating woollen sweaters, jackets and blankets.  People in dozens of villages in the south-east of Poland have been raising funds to buy generators, winter clothing and basic necessities for their neighbours across the border. Meanwhile, in the recently liberated Ukrainian cities in the south-east of the country, people have started gathering wood, although Ukrainian authorities have advised citizens not to head into forests without consulting the military, because Russian troops may have left mines, tripwires and unexploded shells behind. But with the price of firewood rising, many have no choice but to take the risk. If a mine doesn’t kill them, the cold might.",Broadsheet,1
1513,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,14/3/2022,936 words,Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan,Look at ministers' plans to secretly make Britons stateless and what do you see: Islamophobia,"We are woefully underserved by the current conversation about Islamophobia. In recent weeks, the debate has hinged on whether or not the government's decision to introduce new national counter-extremism legislation on the basis of the bogus ""Trojan horse"" letter , which was full of anti-Muslim tropes, was Islamophobic. Research has suggested that middle-class Britons hold more prejudiced views of Islam than any other social group. And a Tory minister recently alleged she was sacked for her "" Muslimness "". In all these stories, Islamophobia is approached at worst as a political gaffe, and at best a moral failing, allegation or faux pas. At the same time, mainstream news outlets have reported that Russia's war in Ukraine is horrific because it is taking place somewhere that is ""not like Iraq or Afghanistan"". Journalists have suggested that Ukrainian refugees deserve to be welcomed because they are ""not from Syria"". Such coverage is not only shot through with Islamophobia, but premised upon it. References to Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria evoke wars associated with Muslims that the west justified through its ""war on terror"". Unlike ""westerners"", a racially and religiously coded marker that one reporter helpfully clarified as meaning Christian and white, the characterisation of Muslims as deserving of, or at least predisposed to, violence means our lives do not carry the same value. We cannot be deemed victims of occupation or war in the same way as Europeans. War is often assumed the natural destiny or perpetual condition of predominantly Muslim countries and their people. As such, the right of Muslims to live free from war and persecution is thrown into doubt. This dynamic is not unique; we have seen it play out in the familiar devaluation of Black lives, too. It is the same dynamic that global border controls reinforce, and which we are witnessing currently in the war in Ukraine, where African students have been actively denied escape routes from war. For Black Muslims, dehumanisation is always compounded - where was the anti-war and pro-refugee sentiment when the US bombed Somalia at the same time that Russia invaded Ukraine? These forms of dehumanisation are all manifestations of white supremacy. Discussing Islamophobia as an embarrassing faux pas at the middle-class dinner table is an astounding diversion from this fact. The ideology of white supremacy devalues lives and justifies dispossession and persecution. It has clear ramifications within Britain: as we speak, the nationality and borders bill is in its final phase in parliament. The controversial clause 9 , which the House of Lords has rejected but MPs are yet to agree upon, allows the home secretary to secretly strip people of their citizenship without notifying them. The policy builds on years of extraordinary expansion to such powers, notably the Immigration Act 2014 , which allowed the British government to revoke citizenship on often secret grounds, so long as they are ""satisfied"" that a person will not be made stateless. Making a person stateless is against international law, but this act created a loophole for deprivation of British citizenship even when a person has no citizenship in any other state. Such measures disproportionately target people of colour. The state assumes that we will be eligible for citizenship in other countries (even if we have never visited them). United Nations experts are clear that this specifically threatens the human rights of people of colour "" and especially people from Muslim and migrant communities "". Clause 9 is a human rights abuse. Consider the fact that several British Muslims who have reportedly travelled to Syria to distribute aid have had their citizenship stripped and been made stateless. Human rights only apply if you are seen first as human. Islamophobia is not the preserve of a fringe group. It is the common language of the political and media establishment. You are less likely to lose your job over Islamophobia than retain it - Michael Gove remains a top government minister despite ignoring police recommendations that the ""Trojan horse"" letter was bogus, and pursuing an Islamophobic agenda that has devastated communities in Birmingham. Islamophobic sentiments can even help you become president or prime minister. Islamophobia flourishes, despite the violence it leads to. The recent People's Review of Prevent painstakingly documented how the government's Prevent programme undermines safeguarding and free speech. Hundreds of academics and organisations, such as Amnesty , have long agreed that it encourages discrimination. Elsewhere in the world, Muslims are being directly persecuted. Recently, India's ruling party shared a cartoon on Twitter of Muslims being lynched. Experts warn that calls for anti-Muslim violence have put the country on the path to genocide. Where is the outcry from European states? Mainstream conversations about Islamophobia reflect a racist disregard for life. This is upheld in basic understandings about when violence is justified and when it is not, who can cross borders, whose deaths deserve inquiry, whose citizenship is a right and whose can be stripped away. White supremacy and Islamophobia colour our approach to all of these issues and more. Without confronting this, we will continue down a slippery path. The secret removal of Muslim people's citizenship brings us one step closer to disappearing Muslims by other means.

1521,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,27/2/2022,889 words,Kate Connolly and Jennifer Rankin,"More than 360,000 people have fled war in Ukraine so far, says UN","At least 368,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine, according to the UN refugee agency, and more than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads, Ukrainian authorities have said, with reports of tens of thousands on the move within the country itself. The majority of people are fleeing to one of 12 border crossings Ukraine shares with its neighbour Poland, which by Sunday morning had registered 156,000 arrivals. Others are crossing at one of nine border points with Romania, or into Hungary, Slovakia or Moldova, according to figures collected by the UNHCR. Those with relatives elsewhere in Europe are trying to make their way to other destinations across the EU and beyond.  Most of those arriving are women, children and elderly people. They are carrying their belongings in rucksacks, plastic bags and suitcases, children are clutching cuddly toys, and some have pets under their arms. Reports from the border crossings have related tales of largely warm receptions, as people arrive often exhausted, some elated to be in safety and reunited with relatives, others distraught over what they have left behind. An internal report by EU officials said there were lengthy waits at most borders, including up to 70 hours to cross into Poland and about seven hours to enter Slovakia, with many forced to sleep overnight in their cars in subzero temperatures. The hold-ups were said to be linked to the sheer numbers trying to leave, and mainly due to delays on the Ukraine border, with officials there on orders to stop men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving. Polish authorities are said to be making the entry into the country as straightforward as possible. National willingness to receive Ukrainian refugees is very high due largely to the 1.5 million Ukrainians already resident in Poland and the strong cultural ties between the people. Polish and German media reported cases of men bringing their wives and children as close to the border as possible, sometimes handing children over to their mothers or even to strangers who were then instructed to meet family members already in Poland, working or visiting relatives. Some men sought people they could trust to bring their families to safety, before hugging them goodbye and returning to Ukraine to fight. At the border there are also plenty of men who have left their homes in Poland and elsewhere and are waiting to return home to their native Ukraine. Janusz Wolski, a 70-year-old farmer from the region of Szczecin in Poland, told Der Spiegel he and his Ukrainian wife had driven 800km (500 miles) through the night with his son to pick up his daughter-in-law and his three young grandchildren from Lviv, who were due to arrive at the border crossing of Dorohusk, a village in eastern Poland. He said the plan was for his grandchildren to stay with him at least until the shooting stopped. ""Who knows whether they will ever go back?"" he told the magazine. ""It is unbelievable what this criminal Putin is doing to the Ukrainians."" Emergency camps are being constructed along the border regions and in addition thousands of residents of the host countries have been turning out to hand out blankets, water, bread, chocolate and coffee. Clean nappies for babies and medicines are also being supplied by local volunteers. Some have set up field kitchens and have been handing out bowls of goulash , while others hold up handwritten signs offering accommodation and transport. EU home affairs ministers are to discuss how to provide humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. At least 17 member states have already offered medical equipment, tents and blankets after Kyiv requested aid from the EU's civil protection mechanism on 15 February. An internal note circulated to national capitals, read: ""All EU member states are called to respond to the best of their capacities to the request for assistance from the Ukrainian authorities."" EU countries facing the largest number of arrivals have been told they can trigger the aid mechanism to request contributions from other member states to help them manage arrivals. The ministers will also look at giving a role to the EU's border agency, Frontex, and the police agency, Europol, if, as expected, refugee numbers continue to grow. In Germany, home to about 130,000 people with Ukrainian roots, a number of federal states have offered help. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which borders Poland, and Berlin have promised help will be quick and unbureaucratic. Before the crisis, Ukrainians were able to travel to the EU without a visa and to stay for 90 days. That has now been extended to 180 days.  As pictures of refugees arriving reminded Germans of the summer and autumn of 2015 when about 1 million people arrived in the country mainly from Syria, the national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, announced that people from Ukraine would only need to show their passports to get free travel. All long-distance trains from Poland into Germany and up to Berlin would be free ""in order to ease the onward journeys of people who are fleeing"", a spokesperson for the company said on Sunday.  Meanwhile, across the EU, ordinary people were accessing accommodation and neighbourhood assistance platforms as well as Facebook pages allowing Ukrainians and people who are offering space in their homes to connect with each other.

1536,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,28/4/2022,965 words,Simon Jenkins,Liz Truss risks recklessly inflaming Ukraine's war to serve her own ambition,"The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is playing with fire. On Wednesday night she described Russia's Vladimir Putin as a ""rogue operator"" lacking rationality, and with ""no interest in international norms"". As a result, she said : ""We will keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine."" She is clearly revelling in her imagined proxy war on the Russian bear and no one in Whitehall appears able to restrain her. The use of the word ""we"" publicly identifies Britain's interests with Kyiv's. Truss calls for ever more economic and military aid to be sent to Ukraine, and such aid now teeters on the brink of overt engagement with Russia. She appears to want Russia's other dissident neighbours, Moldova and Georgia, to join the alliance. Though Putin is irrational and unreliable, Truss argues that he is susceptible to deterrence and will not react recklessly to her escalating belligerence. She nowhere mentions the risk involved in her desired escalation, let alone the possible compromises of peace. Hers is tabloid diplomacy. Before his stunt visit to Kyiv this month, Boris Johnson also instructed Volodymyr Zelenskiy not to make any concessions to Putin, a line Truss is clearly seeking to rival. It is not unknown for democratic leaders to play war games to excite their electorates, but this must be the first Tory leadership contest fought on the frontiers of Russia. It is hard to imagine a more delicate and dangerous time for such antics than now. Ukraine is seeing some of the most appalling atrocities since the second world war and the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. There is no conceivable excuse for what Putin is doing to his neighbour. But the burning issue is not the awfulness of war. It is what can be done to stop it. It naturally suits a desperate Ukraine to claim the present conflict threatens to spill beyond its borders and into Europe more broadly. In reality, Ukraine has for eight years experienced a separatist conflict. That conflict did not necessitate the involvement of the rest of Europe or the US. But Truss declares that Putin wants to inflict ""untold further misery across Europe"". She offers no evidence for what is a gross and alarmist assumption, with the implied need for western military retaliation. Putin may be a monster and a liar and we are right to send aid to the people he oppresses, but a strategist should look beyond insults to assess risks and probabilities on the ground. This moment of maximum danger demands all the judgment and skill that narrowly resolved Cuba in 1962. We should remember then that both sides had to climb down. So far in this dispute, Nato has operated with impressive self-discipline. It has laid down the parameters of its aid to Ukraine and stuck to them. Two decades of highly provocative Nato encirclement of Russia halted at Georgia and Ukraine in the knowledge that going further would permanently inflame Moscow. Nato stayed aloof from Russia's Crimea and Donbas occupations. Putin's assault on Kyiv this spring was of a different order, but again Nato calibrated its response. It was able to present a united front to Russia while not inviting Moscow to retaliate beyond Ukraine's borders. Neither western sanctions nor military aid to Ukraine appear to have deterred Putin one iota. They have vastly increased the cost to Russia of his invasion, but as western democracies know well, the cost of military adventures doesn't always impact policy. Putin will settle as and when he feels he has reached his military limit, which is why there is good reason for sending Kyiv weapons. It is also a reason for the common humanity of welcoming Ukrainian refugees, which Johnson's immigration policy has hypocritically denied. None of this is a reason for willing the conflict to continue, let alone risking Nato being drawn into the fight. Apart from anything else, a war with Nato would hugely reinforce Putin's domestic popularity. As was indicated in the Minsk negotiations of 2015 and mooted in Istanbul in March, there will have to be compromise if this is not to become an ongoing agony. An eventual deal will have to embrace Ukraine's security and a degree of autonomy for Donbas. This will be messy. It cannot award Putin victory but it would probably acknowledge the ""Russian-ness"" of Crimea and south-east Ukraine, if not of Odesa. There have been indications that Zelenskiy will accept something of this sort. Yet it is precisely such an outcome that Johnson and Truss now oppose, hoping to boost support from belligerents - and defence lobbyists - within the Tory party. The cruelties inflicted by states on other states should always be condemned by the wider world. But condemnation is one thing, fighting another. When states interfere in the affairs of others it is usually, if not always, bloody and unsuccessful. Ukraine appears to be approaching what could be a final battle with Russia in the south, possibly followed by stalemate and some sort of settlement. The worst thing Zelenskiy could face is western allies in the US and Britain both led by politicians, Joe Biden and Johnson, who feel they are too weak domestically to support him in the compromises of peace. Johnson and Truss have not declared that a Ukrainian deal is for Zelenskiy and his people to decide. They want him to keep fighting for as long as it takes for Russia to be utterly defeated. They need a triumph in their proxy war. Meanwhile anyone who disagrees with them can be dismissed as a weakling, a coward or pro-Putin. That this conflict should be hijacked by Britain for a squalid forthcoming leadership contest is sickening.  Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist ",Broadsheet,0
1543,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,27/2/2022,936 words,Bethan McKernan in Jerusalem,Ukraine appeals for foreign volunteers to join fight against Russia,"Ukraine's embattled president has issued a call to foreign nationals who are ""friends of peace and democracy"" to travel to the country to fight against the Russian invasion.  The appeal from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, published on the Ukrainian presidency's website early on Sunday, said the Ukrainian armed forces were in the process of setting up a foreign legion unit for international volunteers. ""This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,"" the statement said. ""Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine , Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals."" The call was repeated on Twitter by Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and was expected to be the focus of his briefing for international media on Sunday afternoon. Interested volunteers have been told to contact the defence attache of the Ukrainian embassies in their home countries. According to a 2016 decree, foreigners had the right to join the Ukrainian army for military service on a voluntary basis, Zelenskiy's statement said. Sunday's appeal by a sovereign government for foreign reinforcements - reminiscent of international involvement in the Spanish civil war of the 1930s - is unprecedented in modern warfare. The UN says the three-day-old Russian invasion on multiple axes has already claimed 64 civilian lives. Russian ground forces have not advanced as quickly as feared, but fierce street fighting and aerial bombardment is under way in both the capital, Kyiv, and the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv. The world's media has been flooded by images of Ukrainian citizens preparing molotov cocktails in glass bottles and learning how to use light arms as their only defences against the might of one of the world's strongest armies. Poland's Border Guard said on Sunday that some 22,000 people have crossed from Polish territory into Ukraine since Thursday. ""We have to defend our homeland. Who else if not us,"" one man in a group of 20 Ukrainian truck drivers waiting to cross at the Medyka checkpoint told the Associated Press. ""The Russians should be afraid. We are not afraid,"" another man in the group said. They did not give their names, citing their security and that of their families. Poorly sourced ""combat tips"" and offers to pay for flights have been circulating on a Reddit forum called ""volunteersForUkraine"", where the announcement that Zelenskiy is creating a foreign legion was met with enthusiasm. ""I just got out of active duty a few months ago. I plan to sell my car Monday and use the funds to purchase equipment and my plane ticket to krakow. From there I'll find a way to the Ukrainian border,"" posted one user, who claimed to be a US air force veteran from California. ""To any of you with no combat experience like myself ... Be prepared to not come back. I've accepted the fact that I'm going to die eventually. If it's gonna happen at least it'll be towards a cause I believe in."" The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Sunday that Britons who chose to go to Ukraine to fight would ""absolutely"" have her support. The remarks stand in contrast to the UK position on the war in Syria , where UK nationals who have travelled to fight either for or against Islamic State have faced prosecution on their return home. A small but growing number of Ukrainians living in the UK have made plans to go back to resist the invasion, including veterans of the war with Russia since 2014, community leaders told the Guardian earlier this week. On Saturday, the Ukrainian embassy in Israel also issued a specific callout for volunteers willing to fight on Kyiv's behalf. In a Facebook post that was later deleted, the embassy asked people who ""are ready to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine"" to submit their personal details and a description of their military expertise in order to be contacted regarding opportunities to serve. Ukraine is home to at least 43,000 people who self-identify as Jewish and tens of thousands more with Jewish ancestry, making it one of the world's biggest Jewish communities. About 1 million Ukrainian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, and 80% of the remaining Jewish population of 500,000 is believed to have migrated to Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, meaning that for many in Israel, the new war resonates deeply. The Ukrainian embassy in Tel Aviv did not respond to a request for information about how many people have signed up, but one Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldier told the Walla news website on Sunday he was planning to fight in Ukraine after his demobilisation. ""I came across the post and I couldn't remain indifferent to what's happening to the country that my grandfather, grandmother and parents lived in, a beautiful country that I toured less than three years ago,"" said the soldier, who was identified as L. ""The footage coming out of there has left me frustrated ... I felt a burning desire to help."" Another Israeli who took part in an anti-war protest in central Tel Aviv on Saturday night and gave his name as Vladimir told Israel's Channel 13 News that his 10-month-old daughter was still in Ukraine and he was prepared to join the Ukrainian army to protect his family. Israel had budgeted 10m NIS (£2.31m) for helping Jewish Ukrainian refugees and protecting Jewish institutions in the country, the defence ministry said. Preparations were being made for a new wave of immigration from Ukraine to Israel of 10,000-15,000 people in the coming weeks.",Broadsheet,0
1557,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,10/4/2022,1057 words,Angelique Chrisafis in Paris,How Le Pen tried to soften image to reach French election runoff,"When the far-right Marine Le Pen posed for a selfie with a smiling teenager in a Muslim headscarf in Dunkirk on the northern coast, it was a turning point in the presidential campaign. Le Pen wants to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places, including the streets, calling it a ""uniform of totalitarian ideology"". So after posing happily with a girl in hijab, she was attacked for going soft by her far-right rival, the TV pundit Éric Zemmour. ""Let me teach you about humanity,"" Le Pen shot back at one of Zemmour's lieutenants in a TV debate that went viral. ""What would you have done? Pulled her veil off and mistreated her?"" One analyst called Le Pen's tactic of appearing softer in person than her policy proposals a ""masterclass"". She also sought to present herself as less dangerous than Zemmour's extremist newcomers on France's tense and fractured political scene. It was mid-March; her poll ratings took off and kept rising. Le Pen, 53, who has been a member of parliament for five years, has created a distance between her smiling persona - posing with her pet Bengal cats or being mobbed by teenagers for selfies in the street - and the radical reality of her far-right, anti-immigration manifesto to keep France for the French. She has promised a referendum to change the constitution in order to curb the rights of immigrants and foreigners. She aims to prioritise natives over non-natives for housing, benefit jobs and healthcare. She would scrap nationality rights for children born and raised in France by foreign parents. Her success in reaching the runoff against Macron on Sunday is not just about her long-running drive to sanitise her party's image and move it away from the jackbooted and antisemitic imagery of the past. That Le Pen is now closer to power than ever before is in part the result of her own rethink of political strategy. Le Pen's analysis of Emmanuel Macron's five years in power - which have included the gilets jaunes anti-government protests - was that Macron was a polarising figure who had angered and divided the country, and was out of touch with people's everyday concerns. Unlike her two previous populist presidential campaigns - in which she furiously sought to harness people's anger - this time she decided voters were exhausted by years of demonstrations and wanted calm. She positioned Macron as the divisive one, and herself as someone who could unite. Instead of holding big rallies, Le Pen went under the radar to visit markets in small towns and villages, listening and posing for selfies. Instead of pushing her anti-immigration platform - which remains just as radical as before - she focused on the cost of living crisis that risked being worsened by the war in Ukraine. She condemned the Russian invasion outright and played down her visit to Vladimir Putin five years ago. To advance her position, Le Pen put forward her own personal narrative of suffering. Five years ago, her supporters had been horrified when she performed so badly in the 2017 presidential TV debate against Macron - mixing up names of companies, getting dossiers wrong - that it was described as ""political death live on air"". She was written off as finished. But she believed that voters would identify with a personal story of picking herself up after defeat. ""People who have lived through painful moments can better understand the suffering and distress of others,"" she said. She talked about her difficult childhood as the child of a demonised political figure, Jean-Marie Le Pen, like her a far-right presidential candidate, describing how aged eight she woke in her nightdress amid shards of glass and a blown-away bedroom wall following a bomb attack aimed at killing her father. She talked about her teenage embarrassment at her parents' public divorce battle, during which her mother posed nude in Playboy. The gilets jaunes protests had highlighted the difficulties of single mothers; Le Pen described raising her own children alone. When her niece, Marion Maréchal, abandoned Le Pen and joined rival Zemmour, Le Pen was emotional on TV, saying she had helped raise Marion as a baby. Le Pen rose in the polls while Zemmour dropped, damaged by his previous admiration of Putin and initial refusal of Ukrainian refugees. Ultimately, Le Pen knew that to have any chance of winning the final round, she must neutralise the nation's fear of her. Supporters of traditional parties on the left and right had in the past voted tactically to keep her out because she was seen as dangerous, divisive and unable to govern the country or run the economy. But Le Pen reasoned that those parties, the Socialists and Les Républicains, were shrinking on the national stage. By focusing on fears over the cost of living, Le Pen began to turn public opinion around. In September 2021, Le Pen was the 11th most popular political figure in France - already a high position. This month she rose to become the nation's second favourite political personality , behind the former prime minister Édouard Philippe. Last week, the pollster Brice Teinturier of Ipsos found that if Le Pen were elected president tomorrow, more people expected an improvement in their own situation and the situation of the country than if Macron were re-elected. Just as many people trusted Le Pen to fix cost of living crisis as trusted Macron. An Odoxa poll for L'Obs found that in a second-round vote, 19% of people would vote to stop Macron, more than the 18% who would vote to stop Le Pen. The think-tank Fondation Jean-Jaurès last year set out the factors that could facilitate a Le Pen win. She would need to win over large numbers of voters from the traditional right. She would need to have normalised her image to the point where voters no longer found her so dangerous that they voted tactically to keep her out. Macron would have to be viewed with the same general level of mistrust as Le Pen herself to make voters refuse to vote for him. Macron's tactic so far has been to remind voters of the details of Le Pen's manifesto, slamming it as a racist, anti-Muslim platform that would wreck the economy and create mass unemployment. But Macron's camp has found it harder to make criticism stick to Le Pen. Le Pen argues that catastrophising against her no longer works.

1573,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,30/10/2023,1629 words,Nathalie Tocci,"Europe could have helped de-escalate war in the Middle East. Instead, its fractures are fuelling conflict","The outbreak of the worst violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades , triggered by Hamas’ horrific attack on 7 October and Israel’s disproportionate military response, marks a turning point in the unravelling of Europe’s role in the world. Only a few months ago, the story was one of Europe, slowly but surely, acting as one. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukrainian courage and US military support enabled Ukraine to stand. Washington’s assistance far outstripped what Europeans collectively could muster. But as the war dragged on, European governments rose to the challenge . And political unity in support of Ukraine has held despite setbacks, notably those created by Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. Eleven packages of sanctions on Russia, the hosting of millions of Ukrainian refugees, the victory over Moscow’s attempt to weaponise Europe’s energy dependence, and the sustained increase in military and economic assistance have been pillars of a concerted strategy. The EU decisively reopened discussions on new members joining, recognising that after the invasion of Ukraine, enlargement is a strategic imperative. Meanwhile the transatlantic relationship is in a good place: we would need to rewind to the 1990s to find a time in which the bond was as strong. More broadly, Europe has pursued its energy transition through agreement on its Green Deal ; bolstered economic and technological security to chart its way amid the growing US-China rivalry; and sought ways to engage countries in the global south. This has been done via diplomatic outreach and a new momentum behind the €300bn “ Global Gateway ” initiative, which is designed to boost green growth and infrastructure. The explicit link drawn between the Global Gateway and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (Imec), launched at the G20 summit in Delhi in September, reflected how Europe had to refashion its policies to make them more appealing to the global south. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, came to office in 2019 declaring that she wanted to lead a “geopolitical commission”. Most of us took that to mean an EU equipped to navigate, on behalf of its 450 million citizens, a world of dangerously growing geopolitical rivalries. And until a few months. ago, a geopolitical Europe seemed to be in the offing. That is when it all started to go wrong. In western Africa, Europe, represented essentially by France, too burdened by colonial baggage to succeed in its 10-year military operation to root out jihadist forces , has been booted out. A string of military coups, coupled with the breakdown of governance, the devastating effects of the climate crisis, food insecurity and a surge in outward migration, all point to a massive European policy failure. What Brussels calls its “integrated approach”, whereby enhanced security for western-friendly African governments, would be combined with development aid and democratic reforms is moribund. EU leaders redirected their gaze to north Africa, with a tawdry cash-for-migrants deal signed in July of this year, pushed by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, to in effect buy Tunisia’s services as a gatekeeper, stopping migrants from crossing the Mediterranean. As might have been predicted, the Tunisian dictator, Kais Saied, later reneged on the deal , wanting his cash with zero strings attached. This short-sighted policy now lies in tatters. Instead the EU hides its lack of vision behind African organisations: after the coup in Niger in August, it was the member governments of Ecowas that delivered an ultimatum to the ringleaders to restore democracy. Europe was left mouthing that it had all along preached “African solutions to African problems”. Appealing as the slogan sounds, it conceals only that Europe is clueless about what to do. In the western Balkans, the situation is not – yet – so dire, but despite the revival of the prospect of EU membership for candidate countries, violence has flared between Serbia and Kosovo. Again the EU has been helpless in stopping it, let alone able to cajole a diplomatic agreement between Belgrade and Pristina. Far worse is the situation in the Caucasus. To be fair, EU failings are not from lack of effort. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, should be credited for mediating an agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan after the 2020 war. But this ultimately collapsed as the conflict turned violent through Azerbaijan’s siege on Karabakh, followed by its military takeover and the ethnic cleansing of almost all the 120,000 Armenians from the enclave. And we still cannot say it’s over, with Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey and implicitly by Russia, claiming a corridor through sovereign Armenian territory to connect it to its exclave of Nakhchevan, which it could try to seize by military force. The full extent of the unravelling of the “geopolitical Europe” ambition has been clear since the renewed outbreak of war in the Middle East. Europe, like the US and the Gulf monarchies, had implicitly bought into the cynical Israeli narrative that a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could be bypassed. Israel’s overwhelming force and subjugation of the Palestinians, alongside the elimination of the Palestinian question from the regional equation through the normalisation of Israel’s ties with the Arab world, were part of a strategy. This implicitly accepted that stability in the Middle East was possible without a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The policy was first endorsed by Donald Trump with his 2020 Abraham accords , between Israel on the one hand and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco on the other. The same approach has been pursued under Joe Biden. A normalisation agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia would have represented its crowning achievement. Europe however, fell into its traditional role in the Middle East: playing second fiddle to the US. The Imec initiative, featuring precisely Israel, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, alongside India and the EU, is further evidence of this. Bypassing the Palestinian question at least meant the EU could dodge the problem that its own hard-fought internal consensus on the conflict – a two-state solution based on 1967 borders – had been coming adrift. Those EU governments that unconditionally sided with Israel had startedpassively following Benjamin Netanyahu’s government’s undermining and rejection of the two-state solution. The tragic events in the region since 7 October have brutally exposed Europe’s contradictions. There has been a baffling cacophony of voices, from EU aid for the Palestinians being suspended and then restored, to ambiguous messaging on the need for Israel to defend itself within the limits of international humanitarian law.  Whereas some European leaders, such as Michel or the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, have been clear in their messaging on Israel’s legal obligations, others including Von der Leyen have been highly ambiguous, causing friction within European institutions and beyond. Semantically, the differences may seem marginal; politically, they amount to the difference between approaching a fire with a water hose and a gas canister. When it has looked as if Europe’s approach was hitting rock bottom, the EU has continued digging. Heads of government argued over whether to call for a humanitarian pause in the bombardment of Gaza or a ceasefire, eventually converging on the far weaker former formulation. But the ink was barely dry on that agreement in the European Council when the 27 EU countries split threefold at the United Nations general assembly, with eight voting in favour, 15 abstaining and four voting against a Jordanian resolution calling for a truce and the respect for international humanitarian law. France voted in favour, yet a few days earlier the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had added to the confusion, proposing the reactivation of the anti-Islamic State coalition to fight Hamas. A non-starter on nearly every level, it appeared little more than a wink to Netanyahu, who has drawn the “ Hamas = ISIS ” parallel. The crumbling of European unity over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may ultimately be a footnote in the long history of diplomatic failures on this tragedy. But it should be more. It was the European Community that, back in 1980, first recognised the legitimate self-determination rights of the Palestinian people, and the union that in the late 1990s articulated what a two-state solution could actually mean. It is still the EU that is Israel’s biggest trading partner and the Palestinians’ biggest aid donor. With more courageous and coherent leadership, Europe could have played a far more constructive role. And while the repercussions of its divisions are so far internal, this could change if the acrimony persists and the struggle for internal consensus saps energy for constructive action elsewhere, including in Ukraine. While the Middle East burns and the US, albeit one-sidedly, tries to contain the fire, Russia and China watch in smug delight. With hopes for a geopolitical Europe evaporating before our eyes, some might say “so what?”. The answer is that in a world in which fragmentation, polarisation, conflict and violence are gaining the upper hand, a multilateral union that stands united and lives up to its democratic principles is needed – both for the sake of European citizens and the rest of the world.

1579,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,29/11/2022,2725 words,Amelia Gentleman,"’There’s nowhere else for them to go’: what next for 100,000 Ukrainians and the Britons who took them in?","Most evenings, while Katya Zaikhchuk was waiting in Poland for the Home Office to grant her and her 15-year-old son, Sasha, a visa to come to England, she would get a video call from her host, Clare Birkbeck, as she cooked supper at home in Essex. “I’d walk around the house, showing her the kitchen and the bedrooms, trying to make her feel comfortable, showing her what living in our house would be like. I was more worried for them than nervous for us,” Birkbeck remembers. She and her husband bought a Ukrainian flag from Amazon, and their daughter made a poster decorated with yellow and blue curled ribbons and carefully transcribed a welcome message from Google Translate, which they took to the airport when they went to meet their guests in April. “You could see they were both very nervous. When they saw us, they hugged us and cried.” Birkbeck, a landscape architect, and her husband deliberated for only a couple of days in early March before resolving to host Ukrainian refugees. There was a community of people in and around the Essex town of Saffron Walden who were coming together to offer rooms, and it felt as though there would be a lot of support for both the hosts and the guests. “It felt very easy to decide. People were in awful situations,” she says. They had the space: three of their four children had left home – two were at university and the third was working in London. “So far it has been a very positive experience. We’ve been really lucky because we’ve got on so well.” But eight months on, Birkbeck and her Ukrainian guests are beginning to think longer term, and realising that an agreement that they envisaged lasting at most a year may be challenging to move on from. There is much to celebrate about the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which was set up very rapidly in the weeks that followed the Russian invasion, but the next few months will test whether it can survive as a model. More than 104,100 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under the sponsorship scheme, while another 40,000 came to stay with relatives. “We have never done anything on this scale. The Kindertransport brought around 10,000 children here in 1939. This is 144,000 people in just over six months – it’s unbelievable,” says Krish Kandiah, who this year launched the Sanctuary Foundation, which became one of the matching organisations helping hosts to find refugees in need of homes. “This is a global gamechanger in terms of refugee sponsorship schemes.” Many of those who signed up to the scheme in Saffron Walden feel very glad to have been involved, but they also say they may need more support if they are to continue hosting. At the moment the government pays them a “thank you” payment of £350 a month, regardless of the number of people they host. “It’s awkward to moan about it, but it feels like we’re a bargain,” says one host, who has given rooms to four people and is conscious of rising bills. When the scheme was launched in March, hosts were asked to make a commitment for a minimum of six months. That period has expired for those who were quickly granted visas in March and April, and while most hosts are happy to extend the invitation for another six months or a year, some are beginning to feel uneasy about an emergency arrangement becoming permanent. Records for the district council of Uttlesford, the rural Essex area that includes Saffron Walden, show that in September, 126 hosts were looking after 198 people from Ukraine, with 25 host families in the medieval town itself. Local primary and secondary schools have been welcoming to children, offering places quickly and giving out vouchers for shoes and free uniforms. Volunteers have helped out by donating clothes, free ballet lessons for children, organising English classes and putting on welcome picnics. There is no exit strategy and that feels difficult for all of us. We all plunged in without knowing how it was going to pan out  When the end of the initial period approached, Uttlesford council wrote to hosts asking if they wanted to extend the agreement for another six months. So far, 18 households have told the council they need help to find somewhere new for the refugees they are hosting. Nationally, 2,175 Ukrainian households have had had to register as homeless (about a half of these of had been living with Homes for Ukraine hosts). “The main problem is that there’s nowhere else for them to go,” said one host (asking not to be named, to avoid upsetting the people living with her). “There is no exit strategy and that feels difficult for all of us. We all plunged in without knowing how it was going to pan out and our lives quickly became emotionally entangled.” While in theory Ukrainians can claim housing benefit and rent their own places, most were invited to stay in relatively well-off areas where households have the time, money and space to devote to hosting refugees, but which are difficult places in which to find affordable housing to rent. One host worries that a refugee in the town is jumping prematurely into a relationship with a man she hardly knows in order to secure somewhere to live longer-term. “You see people making very stark choices,” she says. In September, Uttlesford council held a meeting for hosts and guests to set out their options if they wanted to move on; about 70 people turned up for what turned out to be a bleak evening. Council officials made it clear there was almost no social housing available locally, and renting privately would be difficult too because of high rents; they set out how Ukrainians who wanted or needed to move might have better options in cities such as Peterborough or Colchester where rents are lower. “It was a hard message and people were freaked out,” says a host who attended the meeting. “They said you need to have £50,000 income if you want to rent here. I cried afterwards. I’ve got a job here, my son’s in school here,” says Zaikhchuk. “You’ve had one big upheaval and you don’t want another,” says Birkbeck, but they both know the current situation is probably not sustainable. A few months after Katya and Sasha arrived, her mother followed (bringing the family cat). Her mother is being hosted by nearby family, but owing to that host’s illness she must find somewhere new to live by December, and ideally they would all like to live together. “She has one month to find somewhere. It’s really tough,” says Katya Zaikhchuk. “Katya wants to live her own life, and my children would quite like to be able to visit home again. It hasn’t been very easy for them,” says Birkbeck. They have searched property websites, but found that landlords want tenants with a good credit rating and are nervous about renting to people from Ukraine.  Hosts here point to schemes launched elsewhere: in Bristol, a rent guarantee has been offered to Ukrainians, and a £1,000 thank-you payment promised to landlords; in Wiltshire, the council will put down a deposit and a month’s rent on behalf of Ukrainian refugees. Why, they ask, isn’t a similar approach being rolled out nationally? I don’t want to ask what their plans are. It’s a very delicate issue – it feels like we’re involved in a huge experiment Everyone finds the question of what comes next an uncomfortable subject to broach. “I don’t want to ask directly what their plans are. It’s a very delicate issue to talk about,” says another host from Saffron Walden. She remains broadly positive about the experience, but is honest about how completely it has overwhelmed her life. “It feels like we’re involved in a huge experiment. It’s like we’re walking across a cartoon bridge which is being built ahead of us as we go along. Everyone is making everything up all the time.” Her neighbour, who is hosting a Ukrainian grandmother, acknowledges that most of the hosts didn’t allow themselves much time to decide. “I knew other people who were doing it – it was a bit: ‘If you’re in, I’m in,’” she says. A local piano teacher, who is originally from Ukraine, put several people in touch with people she knew needed help. “It was impulsive and at that time there was a feeling that this would be done and dusted within a few months. If I’d thought too hard about all the reasons not to do it, I wouldn’t have done it. It was reckless, but my guest has been a delight and so far it has worked well.” The government created the Home for Ukraine scheme partly in recognition of the fact that its recent Afghan refugee resettlement programme was a disaster. Long-term housing had still not been found for those airlifted out of Kabul and £1.2m a day was being spent on housing thousands of people in hotels. (The cost of hotel bills for all asylum seekers is now running at £7m a day.) There was a desire to find a solution by getting volunteers to step up. “Never again will we have people arrive in the UK and go into hotels without a plan, as happened with those coming from Afghanistan,” said Lord Harrington, the former refugees minister, in September. Newspapers have printed the occasional dramatic story of hosting arrangements going wrong – marriages breaking down when the British husband falls in love with the Ukrainian guest, cruel hosts ordering refugees to leave immediately. In Saffron Walden, the strains have been more mundane: friction over the unexpected shock of gas bills when soaring energy prices (triggered by the same conflict that created more than 7 million refugees) coincided with the extra cost of more people in the house having long showers. Both guests and hosts have been startled by cultural differences. Much of this is trivial – surprise from the hosts at the guests’ desire to eat borscht for breakfast and dismay from the Ukrainians at the coldness of English houses, and the suggestion that they put on an extra jumper or fill a hot water bottle rather than turning up the heating (unusual advice for people used to living in Soviet-built blocks with centrally controlled, generous heating). Some Ukrainians are disturbed by the warm November weather, unimpressed by meals of vegetarian pasta and say they find the taste of the water in England different (not in a good way). Some English hosts have been disconcerted to find striking differences in what is considered polite behaviour. “They think we are crazily polite and they laugh about it sometimes,” one host says. Another asked a teenage boy to help with the cooking, and was told: “It’s women’s work. At home women look after men. When I’m older my wife will cook for me.” Most Ukrainian parents with school-age children are surprised at British schools’ focus on wellbeing and at the leisurely pace of teaching maths and science compared with the pressure put on children in Ukraine. “The school is really friendly, but the levels in maths are lower,” says Hanna Sukhanova, who is staying in Saffron Walden with her eight-year-old daughter, Taya. “In Ukraine, she was doing homework until 11 o’clock at night. Here she doesn’t have any homework. She’s happy – I’m worried.” Sukhanova, an accountant, speaks good English and recently started work with a local firm. She hopes to take the British accountancy exams and to be able to rent a home. “I have a job here, my daughter is at school. I don’t want to move.” I’m more used to working with spreadsheets. Working in a cafe is hard. Now I’m very good at talking about bread Some other Ukrainian guests have also found work (nationally, about 56% of those who arrived earlier this year are now working), but many have been obliged to take jobs below their professional qualifications, in order to start earning money and improve their English. Zaikhchuk, who was an accountant with a railway company at home in Poltava, in central Ukraine, has a job in a cafe. “I’m more used to working with spreadsheets. This is not my career, so it’s hard. Now I’m very good at talking about bread,” she says. More unexpected for hosts than the costs and the cultural differences is the all-consuming sensation of absorbing some of the stress of people traumatised by war. Recent refugee programmes for those leaving Afghanistan and Syria have aimed to permanently resettle people here, but Ukrainians have been given three-year visas and expect to return home, which makes decisions very difficult. “No one is in a position to know what is going to happen with the war. Living without certainty is hard and you become caught up in the uncertainty of their lives,” says one host. “That definitely has an impact on you as a host. You feel a huge sense of responsibility for other people’s lives without really being able to help them.” Sukhanova is enormously relieved to have been able to create a sense of temporary calm in this quiet, pretty market town for herself and her daughter, but she recognises that it is a fragile stability, disturbed every time she looks at her phone. She is still getting air-raid alerts for her home town, so she can track the daily dangers faced by her parents and 19-year-old son. “I have to know what’s happening there – I don’t want to switch it off.” Nicola McCahill, who is looking after two boys, Zhenya, 17, and Sergiy, 18, knew she was making a longer-term commitment because she realised the adolescents would need the option of staying at her village home, a 15-minute drive from Saffron Walden, for at least two years. Sergiy was sent by his mother when she discovered that he planned to start military training. “She told me to leave. It was a smart decision. Now that I’m here, I don’t want to be fighting,” he says. He is trying to combine continuing the law degree he started in Ukraine with A-levels in maths, Russian and business studies. “I’m studying all the time,” he says. Zhenya hopes to apply for a computer science degree. Both have had very positive half-term reports from the school. They have pulled through the first difficult weeks of extreme homesickness and are starting to make new friends but, inevitably, thinking about their Ukrainian school mates makes them depressed. “Eighty per cent of them have left,” says Sergiy. Zhenya opens Snapchat on his phone, which shows the faces of his friends dotted across Europe. “Most of them are in Poland or the Czech Republic. Two are in UK, five are in Germany, one in Kazakhstan, in America and Ireland.” “I’m glad that my friends are in a safe place, but most of them will never go back. We’re seeing a better life now we’re away from Ukraine,” says Sergiy. Like most of the other hosts, McCahill has spent a huge amount of time helping her guests to settle in – organising school places, discussing A-level choices and university applications, and registering them with a GP, a dentist and social services. She has helped with the time-consuming administration involved in recording the existence of new arrivals in Britain’s many bureaucratic databases, and tried to console one of them when friends in Ukraine were killed in the fighting. But she shrugs it off as nothing. “It’s hard to say why it’s been good without sounding bonkers. People in Ukraine are fighting for a wider set of people than their own – it’s the least we can do to support these boys and make them feel welcome,” she says, adding that she is anxious not to sound sanctimonious. “I think a lot of people roll their eyes a bit at the idea of do-gooding meddling, but it just felt like the obvious thing to do. It’s hard giving up your personal space. Even if our best friends in the world had come to live with us it would have been hard at times. They have slotted into our family quite well. The main thing is that they are here, not fighting.” Most hosts seem reluctant to acknowledge that they have done something good. “It’s made me very unromantic about the notion of refugees. They are just normal people with different motivations about coming here – not everyone was fleeing immediate attack. You are constantly asking yourself, have you really made things better by helping them come?” says one host. “Your job is just to give them space and maybe a springboard to the next thing, and try not to judge them – although sometimes you do.” The sense that hosts might have done something palpably positive is not something anyone wants to dwell on. “Occasionally,” she adds, “when I see the two girls jumping on the trampoline and playing in the garden with our dogs, I feel glad they are here and not in Ukraine. Nothing matters more than that.”",Broadsheet,1
1587,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,1/1/2023,1481 words,Philip Oltermann in Oslo,‘Battle for the nation’s soul’: Norway faces debate about gas and oil wealth,"As the sun plunges into the Oslofjord on a December evening, passersby stop outside Norway’s new €620m national art gallery, the new €300m Munch Museum, the new €240m public library and the €550m opera house to take in the dying light. Thanks to oil and gas reserves in the waters off its coast, Norway is not only extremely rich but getting richer still. Already the World Bank’s seventh wealthiest country by GDP per capita at the start of this year, the resource-rich Scandinavian country’s profits have ballooned to record levels over the last 12 months, as prices on the energy markets tripled due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Norway replaced bellicose Moscow as Europe’s largest supplier of gas. But in Norway, the wealth of the nation can be an intangible affair. Hakon Midtsundstad, 33, his mother, Elin, and her sister Berit, have stopped at the Oslo waterfront to marvel at the crimson sunset. Asked if Norway is rich, they point at the architectural palaces around them. Asked if they feel as if they’ve become richer this year, the response is a drawn-out “Noooo”, followed by complaints about rising electricity bills. As the citizens of Europe’s biggest energy producer experience their own cost-of-living crisis this winter, and Nato allies question the fairness of one state getting rich from others’ misfortune, Norway is debating where all its money should go – and whether it should be all for one country to keep. According to its finance ministry, the Norwegian state is likely to have earned almost 1,200bn Norwegian kroner (€113bn) from petroleum sales by the end of 2022, meaning Russia’s war of aggression has made every Norwegian citizen at least €20,000 better off on paper. Profits for 2023 are estimated to rise to €130bn, a five-fold increase on 2021. “Of course, this money is not ours; it belongs to the victims of this war,” said Kalle Moene, a professor of economics at Oslo University. In a column for the financial newspaper Dagens Næringsliv, published in June, Moene called for this year’s €100bn excess profit to be put into a new international solidarity fund, with the express purpose of aiding Ukraine and other countries suffering as a result of the war’s knock-on effect on global supply chains, such as Yemen. “There is a long philosophical tradition that says a fair system should compensate those suffering bad luck but tax those who are at the receiving end of good fortune,” said Moene. “If we don’t start talking about what to do with this insane amount of money, other countries will start to hate us. They will think we are greedy.” When Moene made his proposal, however, it received little notice in political circles. On the contrary: in its summer budget, the government of Labour party prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, announced plans to reduce its aid budget in light of the record profits, from 1% of gross national income (GNI) down to 0.75%. Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former party colleague of the government leader, described the announcement as “a punch in the stomach” for a nation that is used to seeing itself as a beacon of international solidarity. “We started giving international assistance to Kerala, India, in the 1950s, while we were still receiving Marshall Fund aid money ourselves,” Egeland said. “This is a battle for the soul of our nation.” While even the revised aid budget would see Norway donating a much higher percentage of its GNI than the OECD average of 0.3%, Egeland said the downward revision sent a fatal signal towards other donors considering cutting their budgets, such as Sweden and the UK. The government’s reluctance to pick calls for an international aid fund is partly political. Since October 2021, Støre’s Labour party has led a coalition with the Centre party, a formerly agricultural party with a protectionist economic agenda. But the inaction also speaks of a fear that debating the rights and wrongs of its petroleum profits could question a now widely popular system that Norway once took considerable political risk to implement. When Norway, still one of Europe’s poorer nations in the first half of the 20th century, discovered oilfields in its North Sea territories in the late 1960s, it could have auctioned them off to private companies, like Denmark did, or used its profits to fund tax cuts, the way the UK did. Instead, Norway used the spoils of the North Sea to expand its welfare state. State-owned company Statoil explored reserves and profits were piled into a collective piggybank, the government pension fund. A budget rule introduced in 2001, the Handlingsregelen, allows only a small percentage – previously 4%, now 3% – of the fund’s calculated annual return to be put back into the state budget. As a result, Norway became one of the few countries in the world to escape what economists call the “resource curse”: the phenomenon of states with an abundance of fossil fuels or certain minerals ending up with less economic growth, less democracy and less social equality. “We have taken a temporary resource and created a possibly everlasting cash stream that can benefit future Norwegian generations”, said Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, a state secretary at the ministry of petroleum and energy. “Over time we have had wise and longsighted politicians who have managed the difficult balancing act between financing important measures in the short term while saving for the difficult days.” The oil fund continues to provide the country with a sturdy safety net: education is still cheap, university free even for foreigners, parental leave fully paid for 49 weeks. Life expectancy is 83.2, 10 years higher than the global average. As other Scandinavian states have cut back their welfare state or switched to workfare models, Norway has remained generous. Tweaking such a winning formula, whether by giving gas discounts to struggling states or changing the budget rule, can trigger nervousness. “I do not think it is right to call Norway a war profiteer”, said Bjelland Eriksen. “We are not against any measure that can bring down high prices. But we cannot bring forward measures that would create an even more difficult situation.” But even if Norway’s wealth fund model continues to enjoy the kind of cross-party consensus that is rare in western democracies, the war in Ukraine and its ripple effects are challenging old certainties. Just a 15-minute walk from Oslo’s opulent waterfront, a queue of people started forming outside Grønland Church on a dark and icy Wednesday morning. From 9am, the church opens its doors to those seeking warmth or a voucher they can redeem for a bag of groceries at the Fattighuset food bank opposite. “We used get 300 people who turn up every day”, said Astrid Asdakk, 58, one of the charity’s volunteers. “Now it’s more like 600.” Most of them are Ukrainian refugees, many of whom struggle to navigate the bureaucracy in the country that has sheltered them. But others are Norwegian citizens who struggle with rising electricity prices, Asdakk said. Household bills for electricity, 90% of which Norway draws from the hydroelectric power stations that dot its dramatic landscape, have risen to record levels this year – a result partly of unusually low rainfall earlier during the summer and high spot prices imported from the European market. Petrol prices are among the highest in the world. “Norway is getting rich, but not necessarily the Norwegians,” said Lars Martin Dahl, 50, the Lutheran church’s pastor. “‘The state is making a profit, but I’m struggling to pay my bills’ – I hear that from a lot of people here. Maybe it’s part of the Protestant work ethic that we are not meant to be seeing this money.” On Norway’s sizeable political left the energy crisis has led some to question the restraint on profits flowing into the national budget. Others want to rearrange energy exchange with Europe to bring down prices. Surprisingly, perhaps, it has not led to calls to abandon international solidarity. The idea of a new solidarity fund has been backed by Norway’s Green party, its small Christian Democratic party, and the Socialist Left, whose support is crucial for Støre’s minority government. “Our view is that we should share at least a part of the profits”, said Ingrid Fiskaa, the Socialist Left’s foreign affairs spokesperson, sitting in her office next to a cardboard 1% sign stuck with chocolate coins. Largely as a result of her party’s pressure, the parliament will this week debate a new solidarity mechanism that could see Norway sticking to its traditional aid target after all. “Unfortunately, war is good for the oil and gas industries”, said Fiskaa. “There’s a collective silence about that fact in Norway. But that’s also because people don’t feel guilty about profits they can’t see. If every Norwegian was given €20,000 in cash, the guilt would certainly be there.”",Broadsheet,0

For its government, it is also an opportunity to score some points in Brussels. Poland has ""never had such an excellent brand, all over the world"", its prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, declared last week. It is ""in the right position in international politics"", he said, no longer behind a ""wall of unfair isolation"". The US president, Joe Biden, is due to visit the country on Friday. Mired in a bitter seven-year standoff with the EU over democratic backsliding and the rule of law, the government in Warsaw - whose populist brand of national-conservatism has also strained relations with Washington - now hopes the fallout from Vladimir Putin's war will finally oblige the bloc to cut it some slack. In particular, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, whose popularity is on the rise again after sliding for 18 months, wants Brussels to unlock 36bn (£30bn) in pandemic recovery funds blocked over concerns about whether Warsaw can guarantee it will spend EU money properly because of its politicised judiciary. But while the Polish government is clearly seeking to capitalise on the country's newfound good-guy status - and may well win some short-term favour - Warsaw's longer-term conflict with the EU is unlikely to disappear, analysts say. ""PiS may be saying: 'Look, there's a real dictator out there, waging a real war - that's all that matters and that's what we should all be concentrating on right now,'"" said Aleks Szczerbiak, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex. ""But at some stage there will be a negotiated peace, or the war will sink into one of attrition and fall out of the spotlight. More normal patterns will resume. And the underlying causes of Poland's rule-of-law dispute with the EU are not going away."" Scarred by centuries of Russian aggression and occupation culminating in nearly half a century of communist dictatorship, Poland has long warned the EU of the threat from Moscow, especially since the time of Putin's 2014 invasion of Crimea. The nationalist PiS-led government's constant recent rowing with Brussels, its culture-war attacks on LGBTQ+ people and abortion rights and its bridge-building with anti-EU, pro-Putin figures such as Italy's Matteo Salvini and France's Marine Le Pen may have slightly muddied the picture. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine was nonetheless a historic ""we told you so"" moment for Poland, said Ben Stanley, a political scientist at the SWPS University in Warsaw. It meant Warsaw could try to position itself as ""the capital that had been warning this would happen"" for years. As Putin's aggression shifted the EU's centre of gravity eastward, the crisis ""creates an opportunity for Poland to stake a claim to being a regional leader"", Stanley said. ""It's determined to show itself as taking the lead in persuading a reluctant west to take tougher action; stiffening resolve in a very public way."" Morawiecki's visit to the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, after the invasion was seen by many as instrumental in Germany's about-turn on arms shipments, defence spending, and financial sanctions. The visit by Morawiecki and the PiS leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, this month to embattled Kyiv ""on behalf of the EU"", alongside the Czech and Slovenian prime ministers, underscored the strategy. Poland has also been tougher than any other EU member state on sanctions in calling for a total embargo on all trade with Russia. It also proposed a Nato peacekeeping force in Ukraine, and stepped up to become the main transit point for western shipments of arms, munitions and military equipment to Ukraine. The country's immense humanitarian effort - albeit widely acknowledged as more due to the extraordinary generosity and mobilisation of civil society than to central government - in taking in more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees is also being touted by some politicians as grounds for EU leniency. A recent poll for Oko.press showed 66% of Poles wanted the government to accept EU rule of law rules and end its dispute with Brussels - including nearly one in three PiS voters. But 56% also said the funds should now be released without conditions, bolstering a potential PiS narrative that Poland should get the money with no strings attached because it has welcomed so many refugees. ""There's a strategy to emotionally blackmail the EU into taking a softer line,"" said Stanley. ""An attempt to refashion the discourse, to say: 'We're trying to deal with real problems; you're just hindering us with all this rule-of-law stuff.'"" Szczerbiak said PiS had long pursued a twin-track strategy towards the EU of accepting inevitable conflict over rule-of-law and culture-war issues, while at the same time insisting Poland was being a ""positive, constructive EU member"" on the subjects that really matter. ""In a sense, the war has actually reinforced that discourse,"" he said. ""It means Warsaw can say: 'OK, so there's a lot we disagree on. But on the really important stuff, look what good Europeans we are.' It means there's now huge pressure on both sides to de-escalate."" Some in Brussels believe Poland, which has put the cost of welcoming refugees from Ukraine at 2.2bn this year alone, could ask for special compensation, perhaps similar to the deal the EU struck with Turkey after the 2015 refugee crisis. But EU officials also say the Polish government now has a bigger opportunity to close long-festering disputes with Brussels over the rule of law which have led to 1m daily fines and the freezing of the country's pandemic recovery fund. Warsaw's plan for the fund could be approved within weeks, EU officials say, if Poland moves ahead with a promise to abolish the disciplinary tribunal of the supreme court, a system of political control that violates EU law. Danuta Hübner, an MEP for the centre-right opposition Civic Platform party and former EU commissioner, said she was proud of Polish civil society's refugee effort but accused the government of being ""entirely absent"". She said Poland needed the recovery funds ""as quickly as possible"" but still had a long way to go to unlock them. Abuse of the rule of law was ""ongoing"", she said, adding that the commission should approve the plan only if Poland's supreme court was properly reformed. Robert Biedron , a centre-left opposition MEP, said it would be outrageous if the commission defied ""the mainstream and the will of the citizens of the county"", as well as the European parliament, by not sticking to conditions to release the funds. He said he would ""fight very hard"" for EU funds for refugee support, but warned against releasing other EU money without ensuring Warsaw rolls back recent changes to the court system that undermine judicial independence. ""The rule of law cannot be another victim of this war,"" he said. ""How would we explain the difference between us and Putin if we don't respect the rule of law?"" Ultimately, said Andrzej Bobinnski and Wojciech Szacki of the Polityka Insight thinktank , the war could be ""a cathartic moment"" for Poland's political class - but it was still ""too early to tell if this means a U-turn for Poland back toward the liberal west"". Some PiS politicians may want peace with Brussels, they argued, others insist the war shows precisely how ""the west was wrong, how it needs Poland, and how Poland now has the upper hand in security, humanitarian, and European issues"". PiS would certainly not hesitate to exploit any EU reluctance to pay up, Stanley said - especially once the enormous future cost of housing, educating and employing 2 million refugees becomes a political reality.",Broadsheet,0
1702,urc_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,3/6/2022,4669 words,Michael Safi and Courtney Yusuf,Devastation and defiance in Ukraine: 100 days of a war that is reshaping Europe,"It was just hours until the first missiles would land. The last day of an era in Europe. On the evening of 23 February, the world braced. Over Ukraine’s border, thousands of Russian troops had received their orders. A president in Kyiv and another in Moscow prepared the most significant addresses of their lives. In western capitals, officials worked to ward off what now seemed inevitable: the end of three decades of peace between Europe’s major powers. And the end of an idea. That trade and prosperity could dissolve old European rivalries. That access to iPhones, Instagram and Ikea furniture could cool the chauvinist impulses that had fuelled centuries of bloody history. In spite of unusually specific warnings from the US government of an imminent invasion, and the buildup of forces in Russia and Belarus, Ukrainians were not panicking. There were no queues at the western borders. The cafes and bars of Kyiv had been packed the previous Saturday evening. People continued making plans for holidays, dates, and swimming lessons for their children. Volodomyr Ksienich, 22, a student organiser, spent the night with friends. They talked about the war, of course. “Nobody really believed it would happen,” he says. Many analysts concurred. The Russian forces massing on the border were too few to occupy the country, they argued. State media had done little to prepare the Russian public for war. An invasion would trigger economic penalties so ruinous to the Russian economy that no leader would dare risk it. All of this was true, and they were wrong. * * *  Day 1: Thursday 24 February Russian invasion begins  The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, goes on TV in the early hours of Thursday with dire news. Dressed in a suit, his face still boyish and uncreased, Zelenskiy informs the country that after weeks of brinkmanship, Vladimir Putin has authorised military action against Ukraine. All of Europe is on the edge of a war that could “burn everything”, he says. At 5.30am, Russian state media begins broadcasting a presidential address. Incensed by what he characterises as the creation of an “anti-Russia” on his borders, Putin announces a “special military operation” aimed at the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine. As he is speaking and in the hours after, explosions are reported in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mariupol and other cities. Ksienich is woken sharply by his father. “Did you hear that?” he asks him. “I think it’s bombs exploding. I think Russia’s started the war.” The family gather their belongings and head to his grandparent’s country home on Kyiv’s outskirts. It is on the drive, when Ksienich stops to refuel his car, that he feels himself cross a dividing line between life before the war and after. “I got out of my car and I heard bursts a couple of hundred metres from me,” he says. It is all still novel: the noise, the shaking ground, the impulse to flee and seek cover. He will grow weary of these sensations in the weeks to come, but the memory of this moment will still pierce through. “It was the first explosion I can remember.” Over the course of a chaotic day, Russian troops and military vehicles are reported to have come within 18 miles of the capital; to have swept through Chornobyl and taken workers there hostage; to have pushed into eastern towns such as Sumy; and to have rained missiles on port cities across the Black Sea. Russian hit squads are searching for the Ukrainian president and gunfire is heard near the presidential compound. There is a feeling of doom in Kyiv and around the world. By sunset, Ksienich’s family have gathered at the country house. Tomorrow they will need to decide whether to stay or go west. But first, they must survive the night. “We had a long discussion before going to bed, me and my relatives,” he recalls. “The Russian army could be trying to invade the place where we were staying. So we decided that some of us will sleep, some of us will not.” Ksienich is part of the shift that sleeps first. He has a fitful spell in bed, ruminating. “You understand that something terrible is happening in your country,” he says. After four hours, he gets up and takes his place on guard duty. * * *  Day 2: Friday 25 February ‘The president is here ’  Kyiv is being attacked from three directions. Blasts are being reported across the city. Gun battles are raging in its northern suburbs as Russian forces close in. Ukraine’s defence ministry urges those who have not fled to make molotov cocktails and prepare to use them. Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, tells parliament that Zelenskiy has missed a scheduled call that morning, pausing as his voice falters. The chamber fills the silence with spontaneous applause. Europe is uniting in revulsion and solidarity, imposing new sanctions, debating whether to excise Moscow from the Swift payments system. Russia is expelled from the Eurovision song contest. A few dozen miles from the city, Ksienich and his family decide to stay. “We decided we needed to try to protect ourselves, then to protect our family, then to protect the whole country, if it’s possible,” he says. The family get to work building makeshift barricades around their neighbourhood to slow oncoming tanks or armoured vehicles. They make contact with other men in the area and form a local defence unit. Ksienich is handed a Kalashnikov rifle several decades older than he is. Forty-eight hours ago he was a data analyst, but now he is learning to fight like an insurgent. “They told us what to do when a column is right near you,” he says. “What to do when you see a tank.” In the few quiet moments, he feels a moral vertigo. “You need to switch from a life where you are trying to solve all your conflicts verbally, by talking … But now you have ammo and a gun.” That night, during a pause in the shelling, the Ukrainian president resurfaces. He posts a 32-second video, shot on the streets of Kyiv himself. “Good evening, everyone,” he says, dressed in fatigues and surrounded by four other officials. He cycles the camera to each face – “The leader of the party is here. The head of the presidential administration is here” – and finally settles on his own. “The president is here.” * * *  Day 3: Saturday 26 February Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rush to enlist  Kyrylo Demchenko, a history student from Dnipro, joins the rush of young men signing contracts to enlist in the Ukrainian army. He is immediately handed a gun and sent to a highway at the edge of the capital. Hours after he arrives, Demchenko, 20, and his unit spot Russian soldiers and open fire. He survives, but has little memory of the exchange, only fleeting images. “It is so terrible, so cruel,” he says. “I remember the music of the war – the bomb attacks, the shooting of the guns. I remember the tracer bullets, lighting up when they fly. I remember the anti-aircraft missiles. I remember short, separate details. “It’s like a terrible story from a previous life.” * * *  Day 4: Sunday 27 February West unites in response to invasion  It is 3am, in a forest on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ksienich and a small unit of volunteers sit in silence, waiting for the telltale crack of a tree branch under a boot, or the rumble of a helicopter. Russian battalions are 5 or 6 kilometres away, he says, but the mood on the ground is buoyant. “The first day many people were depressed, we didn’t know how our army would do,” he says. “After two or three days we have understood our army is very well prepared … We are planning to get rid of all the Russian occupants and get back Crimea and the occupied territories.” Roads to the west of the country are choked with traffic and more than 300,000 Ukrainians have already fled the country. They are virtually all women and children; martial law has been instituted and men between 18 and 60 are banned from leaving. Across the country, families, friends and lovers are being divided, some for ever. Old maxims of European security are crumbling every hour. Germany is sending anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to Ukraine, breaking a postwar taboo against exporting arms to conflict zones. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz announces the creation of a €100bn (£85bn) fund to boost the country’s armed forces. He calls it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Putin “does not turn the clocks back”. Four days in, Ukraine appears to have absorbed the initial Russian blow. Zelenskiy is still alive and in control of the government. Russian forces are uncoordinated, unable to take control of the airspace and running out of fuel and food. Hostomel airport, outside Kyiv, is the sight of fierce fighting, preventing Russia from using it as a bridgehead into the capital. In Bucha, a commuter town near Kyiv, an invading Russian column is devastated by Ukrainian artillery and retreats. But the soldiers return after a few hours, occupy local homes and dig in. Putin’s plan appears not to have account for a decisive factor: that Ukrainian society would resist. That young, untrained people like Ksienich would take up guns, spend nights in a forest and risk death to defend their homes. * * *  Day 9: Friday 4 March Combat reaches Europe’s largest nuclear plant  Fighting in Ukraine’s east has reached the town of Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. To the horror of world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a building inside the facility is hit by Russian shells and is set ablaze. Miraculously, the damage does not extend to the reactors, avoiding a catastrophic nuclear release, though exchanges of gunfire and artillery around the site continue. “This is unprecedented,” says the IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi. “Completely uncharted waters.” The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, tells the security council the world has “narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe”. In Mariupol, another disaster is taking shape. Hundreds of civilians have already died in shelling since the beginning of the war. The city is surrounded and its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, announces remaining residents no longer have heat, running water or electricity. * * *  Day 15: Thursday 10 March UK sanctions Abramovich, signalling end of ‘London grad ’ era  Roman Abramovich, one of the world’s richest men, whose ownership of the Chelsea football club has revolutionised the English Premier League, has his assets frozen and is banned from travelling to Britain. The sanctions against the oligarch – whose ties to Putin have been the subject of warnings for years – signal what campaigners hope is the end of London’s three-decade embrace of dirty Russian money. The number of Ukrainians who have fled their country passes 2 million, in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. * * *  Day 17: Saturday 12 March Kyiv braces for invasion  Russia’s attempt to push its forces towards Kyiv has hit a snag. Ukrainian forces have blown up bridges and flooded plains, forcing the bulk of columns on to a few narrow roads. The result has been a predictable traffic jam. But after a few days, forces appear to be regrouping for an assault on the capital. Kyiv is awash with anti-tank weapons, barricades and armed men. Ksienich has survived, and is stunned at the transformation of his home city, preparing for a battle “that could be compared to the battle for Kyiv in the second world war”. Ukraine is receiving equipment donated from around the world, including sniper scopes manufactured by the glass and crystals firm Swarovski. “It costs thousands of dollars,” he marvels. In a city bracing for war, there are still open cafes, barbers and other pockets of normal life. “It is even possible to eat yoghurt or ice-cream somewhere in the city,” Ksienich says. Moscow is making faster progress in Ukraine’s south. The strategic port of Kherson has become the first major city to fall to Russia. About 2,000 people are estimated to have attended a protest in the city against the occupation. Russian troops fire warning shots to disperse them, “but people are not afraid”, two anonymous diarists write. “But among the crowd, men in dark clothes are wandering, with hoods, hiding their faces, recording.” * * *  Day 24: Saturday 19 March Mariupol theatre refuge struck by Russian missile  Russia says it is “tightening the noose” in Mariupol. After relentless shelling that has destroyed more than 80% of residential buildings in the city, according to an estimate by its mayor, Russian forces have reached the centre and fighting has broken out around the Azovstal steelworks, a labyrinthine, Stalin-era facility that stretches for 10 sq km (4 sq miles), where hundreds of civilians are taking shelter. A few days earlier, Russia bombed a theatre where an estimated 1,300 civilians were taking shelter. The Russian word “????” – “children” – had been marked out in large letters outside the building, in a fruitless appeal to the humanity of the attackers. An Associated Press investigation later estimates that at least 600 people were killed in the strike. * * *  Day 26: Monday 21 March Russian campaign in chaos as global food prices soar  Just after midnight a Russian tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, publishes a report claiming 9,861 Russian troops have been killed so far and 16,153 have been wounded. The breathtaking three-week toll is approaching the number of Russian servicemen killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet Union’s decade-long failed occupation. By the end of the day, the figures have been removed from the story (the newspaper claims it was hacked) but its scale echoes what observers are seeing on the ground. The Russian campaign is indecisive, bogged down and pursuing too many targets at once. There is “no real centre of gravity, five to six different axes of advance”, says Michael Kofman, a specialist in the Russian armed forces. “The military is trying to stretch itself thin, they’re stuck in urban fighting around Kyiv in the north, they can’t make much press in the east around Kharkiv or Sumy.” Even in the south, where Russia’s forces are most numerous and making the most progress, they are trying to advance in two opposite directions, towards Mariupol in the east and west towards Odesa. “Which makes no sense whatsoever,” Kofman says. “None.” The pain of this misadventure is starting to be felt around the world. Egypt, which imports 80% of its grain from Russia and Ukraine, fixes the cost of bread in response to a surge in prices. The soaring cost of fuel compounds a severe currency crisis in Sri Lanka. The price of cooking oils, cereals and meats are on their way to the highest levels recorded by the United Nations since it started tracking in 1990. * * *  Day 36: Thursday 31 March Russia announces ‘radical reduction’ in military activity  Kyiv is quieter than it has been in weeks. “We don’t hear anything about [Russia] trying to capture the city any more,” Ksienich says. Days before, Russian negotiators at peace talks in Turkey made the surprise announcement that their forces would “radically reduce military activity” around Kyiv and another embattled city, Cherniyiv. The Ukrainian government is sceptical, but shelling in the capital has eased over the past week. Streets are busier and shops are reopening. “There are huge sales on everything because businesses aren’t sure if [their stock] in warehouses will be safe, because Russia is bombing warehouses full of food, clothes, oil,” Ksienich says. There is a feeling of relief in the city but also a building sense of dread at the rumours starting to emerge as Russian forces pull back. “Some friends of mine [are] in Irpin, a city near Kyiv that was captured,” Ksienich says. “Our army is there and many civilians tell scary things about how the Russians behaved there … They were just shooting civilians, driving tanks over them.” * * *  Day 38: Saturday 2 April War crimes discovered in Bucha and recently liberated towns  At 2.33pm London time, an alert is posted on the wire of the news service Agence France-Presse. It reads: “At least 20 bodies seen in one street in town near Kyiv.” It is accompanied by photographs and video footage documenting the streets of Bucha, a satellite city on the outskirts of the capital. They are scenes from hell: crushed neighbourhoods, bound corpses strewn in the roads and bodies hastily buried in the front yards of their homes. In a cellar, authorities find the body of a woman dressed in a fur coat and nothing else, and torn condom wrappers on the floor above. The discoveries immediately draw comparisons to the killings at Srebrenica or the My Lai massacre. “What Putin has done in Ukraine doesn’t look far short of genocide to me,” says the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson. Over the coming days, journalists reach further-flung villages and find similar horrors. In Trostianets, near the Russian border, there is evidence of summary executions and torture. In the village of Staryi Bykiv, 50 miles east of Kyiv, Russian soldiers killed at least nine civilians. From homes in Novyi Bykiv, a settlement just across a river, they looted items including jewellery, a scooter, computers and from one house, a novelty cushion , in an orgy of looting so widespread across areas occupied by the Russians that it appears to be a systematic part of military culture. Obscured by the grisly discoveries is a significant deadline: Friday was the end of the one-year term of tens of thousand of Russian conscripts, who are permitted to leave the army, despite rumours the Kremlin might seek ways to keep them in its ranks and bolster the invasion force. It sets the future shape of the war: Russia will not have the numbers to encircle and cut off Ukrainian troops in Donbas. Any future Russian gains in the east will come through grinding attrition. “They will have to fight for every square inch of territory,” Kofman says. * * *  Day 43: Wednesday 7 April Rouble surges back to pre-invasion levels  Russia’s currency, the rouble, hits 80 to the dollar, roughly its rate before it invaded Ukraine, an astounding rebound from the records lows of the early weeks of the war. The rouble’s resilience, despite suffocating sanctions and an exodus of foreign businesses, is based on short-term financial engineering, a surge in oil and gas prices caused by the invasion – and Europe’s inability to quickly find alternative supplies. Germany, whose economic model is built in part on cheap Russian gas, is weathering diplomatic pressure to impose an outright ban on imports, calls that have grown more urgent since the discovery of war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere. Germans are being urged to do their part by turning down thermostats and driving less, but business leaders such as Martin Brudermüller, the chief executive of BASF, one of Germany’s biggest chemical companies, is warning against drastic cuts. “Do we want to destroy the entire economy with our eyes open?” he asks. * * *  Day 54: Monday 18 April Russia launches eastern offensive  As Zelenskiy warns that Russia has commenced its campaign to seize all of the eastern Donbas region, at Mariupol’s sprawling Azovstal plant the few thousand remaining defenders and civilians – running out of food, water and medicine – are given a midday deadline to surrender. Those who do are “guaranteed to keep their lives”, the Russians say. They reject it. Kyiv has surprised the world and repelled the invaders, but success is bittersweet. So many have been killed or are still fighting, Ksienich says, while people in the capital begin to resume normal lives. “You see a guy in a military uniform with a gun, who is ready to defend our country. And then you see a guy coming from a bar who’s drunk … People are relaxing but I don’t think it’s right.” Early in the war, he felt confident Ukraine would expel Russian forces from Kyiv, Crimea and Donbas. Now he is more circumspect. “I hope we at least get our borders before the invasion started,” he says. * * *  Day 61: Monday 25 April US appears to widen war aims  Speaking in Poland after a surprise visit to Kyiv, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, is asked if Washington’s goals in Ukraine have changed since the beginning of the war. He recites the administration’s standard line about helping Ukraine to defend its sovereignty. But this time, he adds something new and further-reaching. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin says. “It has already lost a lot of military capability. And a lot of its troops, quite frankly. And we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.” * * *  Day 77: Wednesday 11 May Puppet rulers of Kherson float annexation  As the fighting in the east settles into a grinding war of attrition , the puppet leadership of Kherson, captured by Russia early in the fighting, say they plan to seek annexation by Moscow, giving a hint of a possible future for other cities and towns seized by Russian forces. Across the occupied region, Russia has reportedly disappeared mayors , journalists and artists as it seeks to tighten its grip. In some areas it will soon introduce the rouble as an official currency and offer fast-tracked Russian passports to residents. * * *  Day 83: Tuesday 17 May Mariupol falls as Sweden and Finland apply to join Nato  Russia has won the battle for Mariupol but is losing its war against Nato’s encroaching alliance. Hours after Ukraine’s military command announces it is no longer defending the Azovstal plant, and the remaining fighters are bussed towards an uncertain future in Russia, the prime ministers of Sweden and Finland confirm they will jointly submit applications to become members of the group. If they succeed, the length of Nato’s border with Russia will double overnight. In a rare display of dissent in a country where criticising the war – or even referring to it as one – now attracts a prison sentence, a Russian retired colonel offers a withering assessment on state TV of an invasion that has cost thousands of lives for little territorial gain. “We are in total geopolitical isolation and the whole world is against us, even if we don’t want to admit it,” Mikhail Khodaryonok tells a dumbstruck panel show.  * * *  Day 85: Thursday 19 May US passe s $40bn military and economic aid package  The US and its Nato allies have walked a careful line so far, seeking to funnel weapons and aid to Ukraine without provoking Russia into widening the war beyond its borders. In recent weeks, sensing an opportunity to trap Russia in a quagmire, western powers are pushing that line further. The Biden administration passes a massive $40bn (£32bn) package of military and economic aid for Ukraine, and is shipping out long-range howitzers, armoured vehicles and kamikaze drones, a step up from the anti-tank missiles and small arms it sent earlier. It is now trumpeting its role training Ukrainian soldiers in how to use these weapons systems – and in providing intelligence that has helped killed a dozen Russian generals. With fighting now largely confined to the east, more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees have returned home, the government says. More than 5 million remain abroad in the largest displacement crisis of the 21st century. * * *  Day 97: Tuesday 31 May Russia gaining ground in eastern war of attrition  Russia is learning the lessons of its disastrous invasion. It has broken into Sievierodonetsk, the last major population centre in Luhansk province outside its control, by concentrating forces that earlier in the war it had spread thinly. Elsewhere in the east and south, it is digging in, fortifying its positions. The heavy fighting in the eastern regions, where Russia can more easily supply its troops, is taking a heavy toll on Ukraine’s defenders. Zelenskiy says 50 to 100 soldiers could be dying each day, in a rare estimate of combat casualties. Whatever triumphalism existed after Russia retreated from around Kyiv has evaporated. The country’s ports are being strangled by a blockade. Cities such as Kharkiv are still within reach of Russian artillery. Territory is expected to change hands back and forth over the next months as both militaries near exhaustion, pause to resupply and launch counter-offensives. It spells a war with no end in sight. Ksienich spends his days ferrying tools and summer clothes to friends fighting in the east. In the spare hours, he works his old job in Warsaw remotely. He makes his life in a void between war and peace. Even if the fighting ends soon, it will have changed his trajectory. He has given up his job overseas, and plans to do a degree in business. “I’m enrolling in how to run government and politics,” he says. “I want to come back to Ukraine [and] help my country.”  Day 100: Friday 3 June Invasion midwifes a new nation  Demchenko, the young historian, has become the sergeant of a logistics unit stationed near Kharkiv. He and his men sleep in muddy trenches and, when they are lucky, on the floor of farmhouses. He shrugs off the danger and discomfort. “When the missile or bullet is near to you, or a Russian artillery shot lands near to you, you understand your situation right now is not as good as it can be. I’m not with a glass of juice near the sea or in my favourite Carpathian mountains.” These difficult days are charged with a potent force, he says, a forging process he had only studied before in books. “Our company was [merged] with people from different socio-economic groups, from different cities, and all of them are very different. They have different educations, different professions, and right now we are together. “It’s amazing to see how different people make this new social construction, how they discuss each other, how they are thinking about their future together … This is like the birth of a new nation.” One hundred days since the invasion, Putin’s army has lost some battles and won others. But the Russian president’s rash invasion has become a strategic catastrophe. Ukraine is embattled but united. It has become the very “anti-Russia” the war was supposed to extinguish.",Broadsheet,0
1828,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,10/3/2022,934 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,Growing pressure to waive visas for Ukrainian refugees,"The Ukrainian ambassador has urged the British government to temporarily lift all visa requirements for those fleeing his country, with pressure increasing on ministers to act over a system that has been heavily criticised. Around 850 people have so far been issued a visa under the Home Office's family migration scheme, announced on Friday - despite tens of thousands with family links to the UK applying. Vadym Prystaiko said that if bureaucratic procedures were ""simplified"" it would ""definitely resolve all the issues"". He told the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday: ""I don't expect many of them to come. I don't want to see these pictures of people banging at the doors in Calais and scratching the doors which are quite sealed."" Campaigners have accused the UK of ""lagging behind"" other European countries over its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis by welcoming a ""pitiful"" number of refugees in the first two weeks of the war. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman called for ""immediate action"" to enable refugees to get their cases dealt with swiftly by removing ""unnecessary delaysand bureaucracy""in the visa application process. Ombudsman Rob Behrens said:""It is vital the Home Officeactsto correctfailingsinits handling of visa applications, especially failings we have previously reported and which we are seeing repeated here. ""In this horrendous situationswift action is needed to make sure the process of getting a visa is simple, accessible and quick. Lives depend on it."" Hundreds of Ukrainians have arrived in the French port town of Calais since the Russian invasion began in the hope of reaching their loved ones in Britain, but have not been allowed to apply to the scheme from there. Confusion arose yesterday after the Home Office announced that a temporary visa centre in Lille - some 70 miles away - which was initially thought to be a facility where Ukrainian refugees could travel to submit their visa applications, would only work on a referral basis. The department was also accused of telling ""outright lies"" after The Independent revealed that a Home Office official had wrongly claimed that Ukrainian refugeesin Calais could obtain freeEurostartickets to travel to a UK visa centre inLille- when in fact this route does not exist. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees grappled with the ""unbearable"" UK visa application process in other European countries, which has seen many forced to wait for hours in the cold and travel for miles. Refugees who attended a UK visa centre inPolandto submit applications to join relatives in the UK were told that they must travel 170 miles across the country in order to complete the process, prompting those going through the process to describe it as ""unbearable"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, described the government's approach to helping Ukrainian people as ""mean spirited"" and accused Britain of ""lagging behind our European neighbours"" in its response. ""The government's family visa scheme is extremely limited and restricted, with visas granted to hundreds of people - a pitiful number, and a fraction of the need and application numbers,"" he said. ""The government needs to urgently waive visa requirements to enable Ukrainians to travel to the UK more easily and then grant them refugee protection as quickly as possible after arrival."" Sonya Sceats, chief executive at Freedom from Torture, echoed his remarks, saying: ""This government's pitiful response to the plight of Ukrainian refugees shames Britain. ""Not only are these failing visa-based schemes causing intolerable heartbreak for Ukrainians blocked from reaching safety here by all the red tape. It is time for the prime minister to listen to the British people and abandon his insistence on visas for Ukrainian refugees."" The government's approach to the crisis came under further criticism after it emerged that home secretary Priti Patel told the Irish government she was concerned that the country's welcoming policy towards Ukrainian refugeeswould allow them to reach the UK by the back door. Ananonymous briefing from a UK government sourceon Tuesday suggested that Ukrainian criminals or drug dealers could take advantage of the Anglo-Irish common travel area to gain access to mainland Britain - a suggestion was labelled as ""disgraceful"" and ""absolutely terrible"" by members of the Irish parliament. It comes after the government faced a barrage of criticism from Tory MPs over its response, with ministers accused by its own backbenchers of showing ""too little compassion"" and urged to ""get a grip"". David Cameron suggested yesterday that the UK should be more generous towards Ukrainian refugees, telling LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr: ""I hope [refugees minister Richard Harrington] is allowed if we want to go for shorter visas, or it's just Ukrainian passports, and perhaps something else, let's find a way to get it done."" Mike Adamson, chief executive at British Red Cross, said:???""Right now, as countries across Europe have done, the UK government must waive visa requirements for those fleeing Ukraine. Security???checks???can still be carried out when people travel or arrive in the UK."" A government spokesperson said: ""The UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Ukraine and we have taken urgent action to process visas at speed for all those eligible to the Ukraine family scheme, while carrying out vital security checks. ""We have protected appointments at all of our visa application centres to ensure there is sufficient capacity and deployed extra staff to help people through the process as quickly as possible.""",Broadsheet,1
1830,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,14/4/2024,1326 words,HOLLY BANCROFT SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,Ukrainian refugees housed with suspected gangsters,"Ukrainian refugees fleeing the horrors of war to find sanctuary in British homes were sent to live with suspected gangsters under the government's flagship Homes for Ukraine scheme, The Independent can reveal. People with suspected links to serious or organised crime were among those approved as hosts under the scheme, which was set up in 2022 to encourage warm-hearted homeowners to lend a spare room to those fleeing Vladimir Putin's invasion. In the worst cases, Ukrainian families and individuals ""just disappeared"", according to one council worker, while others were forced to work for their hosts or were charged rent. In one stark example, a couple with a young child were sent to live with a convicted paedophile. Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones, the shadow safeguarding minister, said the findings, uncovered by this publication, raise serious concerns about the safeguarding and the screening of hosts, as she called for a ""full and proper investigation"". Eleanor Lyons, the independent anti-slavery commissioner, described the reports as concerning. She added: ""We know traffickers often target vulnerable people, so we must do all we can to support displaced Ukrainians and prevent them from becoming vulnerable to exploitation."" The Independent can also report that: *Council workers involved with the scheme reported refugees being forced to work for their hosts on farms and charged rent *One worker claimed some sponsors had only agreed to host young, female Ukrainians ""for the purposes of exploiting them for sexual gratification *""Around a quarter of eligible councils - 37 out of around 150 - said they had been alerted to a serious safeguarding concern about a host, which can include child protection concerns *At least eight people who signed up for the scheme had suspected links to serious or organised crime *One local authority worker told researchers that one applicant was found to have a trafficking conviction Maris Stratulis, England national director at the British Association of Social Workers, said her organisation had raised concerns about the scheme since the beginning. ""For some individuals and families, this scheme has literally been a lifeline and a safe and positive experience,"" she said. ""For others, fleeing to 'perceived' safety has not been a reality - their human rights and needs have not been protected."" She added that poor coordination between the government and local councils ""has created opportunities for children and adults to be lost in a system and vulnerable to abuse and exploitation"". According to the figures, which The Independent obtained through a freedom of information request, at least 93 serious safeguarding alerts were raised across the UK over sponsors who put themselves forward for the scheme. Eight of these were about the links potential hosts had to serious or organised crime. A further 374 warnings, known as ""adverse hits"", were sent by the government to councils about Homes for Ukraine sponsors, the data shows. These hits occur when the host has failed Home Office checks. In the London borough of Croydon, the council received alerts from the Home Office about two separate sponsors' connections to serious and organised crime. The council said these sponsor arrangements were swiftly ""discontinued"" after the alert was received. Suffolk County Council received a similar alert. The Ukrainian guests were offered an immediate transfer to another home, but they turned this offer down and later found alternative accommodation with friends. Another alert over a sponsor's connection to organised crime was received by Nottinghamshire County Council, resulting in a ""subsequent guest change of accommodation"". A case was also flagged in Bedford, where the guests had not yet arrived to live with a sponsor who was suspected of having potential links to organised crime. The council insisted its checks were ""robust"". Sheffield City Council dealt with three serious safeguarding alerts: one sponsor with links to serious and organised crime, one sponsor who had accommodation requests linked to multiple commercial properties, and one case in which the sponsor was abroad and offered to pay for a Ukrainian to live in a hotel room. In the case of the crime-linked host, the Ukrainian guests arrived in the UK but their whereabouts were unknown. The council had to raise a missing persons report with the police, who located them in private rented accommodation in another city. In a case publicised in Northern Ireland, a couple with a young child went to live with a convicted paedophile for a number of weeks before he was deemed unsuitable to be a sponsor. A criminal record check by the Home Office had reportedly not flagged his conviction, and the family had moved into a mobile home on the man's property before further checks had been completed. The social workers' report, compiled by researchers from University College London and the organisation Focus on Labour Exploitation, found that there were strong concerns over the UK's Ukraine schemes. One local authority worker told researchers that a host involved in the Homes for Ukraine scheme had been found to have a trafficking conviction. Another worker in the east of England said: ""We had a number of families and individuals just disappear. Once in the UK they just disappeared, and we had no way of knowing if they were safe or in circumstances which placed them at risk - for example, around labour exploitation, criminal exploitation."" Another interviewee said they had seen cases where hosts had ""agreed to host young, attractive, female Ukrainians for the purposes of exploiting them"". They added: ""We've heard cases where entire families have been hosted and the host has been making efforts to isolate the young female from the rest of the family."" Councillors and people who worked on the scheme also said they had come across cases where refugees had been forced to work for their hosts. These cases included farmers in Northern Ireland reportedly using the scheme to get people to the UK to work for them, and then also charging them rent. Speaking about the blurred line around labour exploitation, one council worker in the East Midlands explained: ""The sponsors are saying, 'Oh, here's the car, could you go and pick my children up?' or 'I won't be back till 9pm, could you babysit the children in the evening?' The Ukrainians feel that they're compelled to do it because they're living in their house rent-free."" One member of a strategic migration partnership - a council-led group designed to implement refugee schemes - said that during the scramble of getting thousands of Ukrainians to safety, they had to ""find a balance between eliminating every single risk, which is just not possible"". Many participants told researchers that visas for Ukrainian refugees had been issued before the pre-arrival DBS and accommodation checks were completed. The checks were then failed, and a new host had to be found at short notice or guests were reluctant to leave. In a briefing given to MPs in February by the Local Government Association, it was noted that local authorities were continuing to report cases where visas were being issued to Ukrainians before councils had carried out sponsor checks. Safeguarding alerts usually go to county councils, but some borough councils also provided responses. A handful of these councils provided a figure of less than five, due to data protection, meaning that the number of serious safeguarding alerts could be even higher. A government spokesperson said: ""Keeping sponsors and guests safe is a priority for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. All sponsors and all adults living in a sponsor's household are subject to stringent checks before they are allowed to host a Ukrainian refugee, and we would urge local councils to contact the police if they suspect any exploitation."" More than 180,000 visas have been issued to refugees through the Ukraine sponsorship scheme, government data shows.",Broadsheet,1

UK basic bank account providers were brought together, with action taken to remove barriers to opening UK bank accounts faced by Ukrainian nationals, such as the lack of a conventional ID. This has helped more than 70,000 people to build their lives more easily in the UK by enabling them to receive their income, send money and pay for goods. Basic bank accounts allow people with a limited credit history to access and carry out everyday banking.  We will continue to help as many Ukrainian refugees as possible access the banking services they need to build a life here  Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith In general, basic bank accounts must be fee-free for standard use and do not have a borrowing facility, such as an overdraft, to help prevent people getting into unaffordable debt. Economic Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Griffith said: “We will continue to help as many Ukrainian refugees as possible access the banking services they need to build a life here – and I’d like to thank UK banks and building societies for their support to date. “A year on from the invasion, Putin should be left in no doubt that the West will not waver in its support for Ukraine and its people.” Under the Payment Account Regulations 2015, the nine biggest personal current account (PCA) providers in the UK are legally required to offer basic bank accounts to customers who do not have a bank account or who are not eligible for a bank’s standard current account. The nine institutions are Barclays, the Co-operative Bank , HSBC UK, Lloyds Banking Group (which also includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands), Nationwide Building Society, NatWest Group (including RBS and Ulster Bank brands), Santander UK , TSB and Virgin Money. A spokesperson for trade association UK Finance said: “UK Finance and the industry is proud to have provided support to help Ukrainian refugees and we will continue to do so. “Last year we worked at pace with members and Government to make sure banking services were available to those fleeing the conflict and we are pleased so many could access an account which has proved vital to helping them settle, and in day-to-day life.”",Broadsheet,1

The 41-year-old singer visited projects supporting Ukrainian refugees and funded by donations from the British public through the Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. To mark one year since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Faith travelled to the Polish capital Warsaw to see how donations to the DEC Ukraine appeal have been put to use. Of the experience, Faith said: “Visiting these projects, I was really touched by how such a heart-breaking humanitarian situation has activated a human chain of kindness across borders. “From the British public donating to the appeal, to local people in Poland using those funds to support refugees, to Ukrainian refugees volunteering to help fellow refugees, to children helping their mothers cope in the absence of fathers and extended families. “I only hope this level of kindness will continue and be extended to other refugees facing the same issues across the globe, be it conflict or environmental disasters. “After all, we are all connected.” Faith performed during the Concert for Ukraine in Birmingham last year alongside the likes of Ed Sheeran and Camila Cabello. The event, which was also broadcast on ITV, ultimately raised more than £13.4 million for the humanitarian effort in the war-torn nation. During a three-day visit to Warsaw in February, Faith visited a number of different DEC-funded projects, including a refugee centre supporting mothers who had been forced to flee Ukraine with their children, and a Ukrainian school set up for refugee children where they are able to learn in their native language. Reflecting on meeting women who had been forced to flee Ukraine – some with young children and others who were pregnant – Faith said: “It was so moving speaking to young mothers who have fled Ukraine. “They had all made the difficult journey to Poland alone with their children, some of them crossing the border while they were pregnant. “I met one woman, Emma, with a tiny baby and two other children and I could remember that feeling of trying to cope, trying to juggle everything. “As a mother, all you want is for your children to be okay, to be happy and safe above all else – and you feel the pressure to make the best choices for them. “Those women have had to make choices that no-one should ever have to.” Faith is among a number of high-profile individuals to have travelled to Ukraine and Poland to meet with Ukrainian refugees since the outbreak of the conflict in February last year. In June 2022, American actor and producer Ben Stiller visited Ukraine, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian citizens as part of his role as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Oscar-winning American actor Sean Penn also spent time with Ukrainian people and President Zelensky during a trip to Ukraine to create a documentary about the ongoing Russian invasion. Faith added: “Many families came to Poland expecting to be here only for a short period, but one year on from the start of the conflict, people are struggling with the reality of living in limbo for such a long time.”",Broadsheet,1

Mr O'Brien said that 89 would be usable within the coming weeks, creating around 5,000 beds for refugees. These would require ""some work, but not extensive work"", Mr O'Brien said. ""There is a spread right across the 26 counties,"" Mr O'Brien told Newstalk. Around 25,000 Ukrainian refugees have now arrived in the Republic of Ireland , putting pressure on the Government to find housing and accommodation. Mass and emergency accommodation centres have already started to be used. Mr O'Brien said that the accommodation would be a ""little bit more long-term"" than the Millstreet Arena in Cork currently being used to house refugees. ""It is about moving quickly on these ones,"" he said. Earlier, Taoiseach Micheal Martin had said that his Government will do ""everything we possibly can"" to provide for Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland.

The cross is being granted listed status to recognise its significance as a symbol of Ukrainian gratitude for refuge in Cornwall following the war. Refugees from Ukrainian cities including Kharkov, Kyiv and Lviv will meet with dignitaries from the UK and Ukraine at the site of the cross in Mylor Bridge in Cornwall. Deputy ambassador of Ukraine to the UK, Taras Krykun, and UK Heritage Minister Nigel Huddleston will both visit the landmark on Thursday. Mr Huddleston said: “This poignant Ukrainian Cross is an important symbol of Britain’s solidarity with the Ukrainian people. “Just as we welcomed those fleeing Soviet Russia 75 years ago, the whole country stands alongside Ukrainians escaping the atrocities of Putin’s illegal war today.” Following the Second World War, hundreds of displaced Ukrainians found themselves in Cornwall after fleeing violent persecution by the communist regime installed in their home country by the Soviet army. A year after their arrival, the Ukrainian refugees built a cross near to their hostel as a symbol of their gratitude for refuge and also of their strong faith. On June 7 1948, three Roman Catholic priests blessed the cross, which bears the inscription: “This symbol of faith in God was erected by Ukrainians who escaping from Russian communists found refuge in England 7 June 1948.” It serves as a reminder of the impact of wars on displaced communities throughout history.  The Grade II listing comes as the UK has welcomed more than 95,000 Ukrainians following Russia’s invasion, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). Vadym Prystaiko, ambassador of Ukraine to the United Kingdom, said: “The United Kingdom has been unwavering in its support and welcome for the people of Ukraine and we are thankful it continues to stand shoulder to shoulder with us. “The Grade II listing of this cross is a beautiful gesture of companionship and support at a time when a new generation of Ukrainians are being forced to seek refuge in the UK.” Refugees Minister Lord Harrington said: “As the people of Cornwall open up their communities to Ukrainians, we can today cement their special place in our shared history with this cross – a symbol of our solidarity and a sombre reminder of the cost of war.” Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England , added: “The Ukrainian Cross is a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and the lives lost and displaced.

The figures, up to April 26, show most (95) visa sponsors are in Belfast , while there are 90 each in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon and Newry, Mourne and Down council areas. Four centres where refugees can get assistance have been set up in Belfast, Newry, Craigavon and Ballymena. They include advice on the health service, schools and housing.

Michael, 73, and Carole Middleton, 67, are reportedly planning to create an annexe at their £4.7 manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire to house the refugees. “Bucklebury has housed a good number of refugees and Carole has been getting advice from villagers and seeking information about how the process has worked for others in the area,” a source told Mail on Sunday. One of the plans includes converting a living room at the seven-bedroom Bucklebury Manor into a separate accommodation for the family. However, there are still security concerns given the regular visits to the property by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children – George, eight; Charlotte, seven; and Louis, four. “Carole talked about wanting refugees to feel they have their own space in her home and has been talking about the logistics of how it all works,” the source added. “There have been a few conversations about this, back and forth.” The Middletons join a number of high-profile figures who have already begun housing Ukrainian refugees, including television personality and fellow Berkshire resident Chris Tarrant. The former Who Wants To Be A Millionaire host described the family – a Ukrainian woman, her elderly mother and ten-month-old baby – as “so sweet” during an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X in May. The source went on to add that Mrs Middleton “suggested she and some of those who are housing refugees should meet up” because she wants to find a way to house refugees herself. The report comes as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge continue to show support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of the country, which was launched in February. According to the United Nations , an estimated 5.6m refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe since the attack. In February, Prince William and Kate Middleton made a rare political statement when the couple posted a message of solidarity with Ukranians to social media. “In October 2020 we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine’s future,” the royal couple said. “Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraine’s people as they bravely fight for that future.” They signed off with an emoji of the Ukranian flag and “W & C”. The mom of three has also subtly paid tribute to Ukraine through her jewelry and outfit choices.

1982,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,3/4/2022,1306 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,Ukrainian refugees facing 'real destitution' in UK,"Ministers are being urged to remove ""needless bureaucracy"" from the UK's refugee schemes for Ukrainians as it emerged those who have fled war are now facing destitution in Britain. Calls are mounting for the government to allow refugees to apply to the Homes for Ukraine scheme from within the UK, and to provide local authorities with funding for Ukrainians arriving under the family scheme, for which there is currently no support. It has emerged that many of those who have arrived in recent weeks, both under the Home Office's family scheme and those without visas, are struggling to access housing, as well as having difficulties finding work, claiming benefits and getting their children into schools. Some have inadvertently ended up in the UK asylum system, meaning they are denied the right to work and given little or no support money. Others had intended to stay with family but found that their relatives do not have space to house them, and had to register as homeless. The Independentrevealed yesterday that the Home Office has shut down parts of its ordinary immigration and visa system - reallocating resources to deal with its bureaucratic Ukraine scheme. Travellers report that priority and super-priority visas are not currently available and ministers have apologised for ""any inconvenience caused"". Standard visas from elsewhere are also subject to delays. Despite the fact that 200,000 people in Britain have offered to host Ukrainians under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, a rule preventing refugees from applying once they are in the UK means they cannot benefit from these offers, with councils and charities instead ""scrambling"" to house and support them. The Independent's Refugees Welcome campaign is calling for the government to go further and faster to help Ukrainians fleeing the war, with more than 183,000 people signing our petition asking ministers to provide more supplies of food, clothing and shelter for Ukrainian refugees and to do more to make the UK a safe haven for them. Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy accused ministers of ""wasting the amazing generosity"" of people who have offered to open their homes to refugees, and called the inability to move between the schemes ""needlessly bureaucratic"". ""If people are already here and need a home, they should be eligible to match up with someone who has offered their home under the sponsorship scheme, especially given how many offers of sponsorship are currently going to waste,"" she told The Independent. ""Councils, charities and ordinary people have stepped up in Ukraine's hour of need. They urgently need more information and support."" Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the fact that Ukrainians arriving under the family visa scheme were falling into homelessness and destitution ""completely undermines the protection this government says it is offering to those fleeing Russian bombs"". He said the ""simple solution"" was to urgently allow Ukrainians already in the UK to apply for the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which would ""immediately open up funding to local authorities to support Ukrainian refugees that need it"". Leyla Williams, deputy director of West London Welcome, said the small charity had been approached by around 10 Ukrainian families in the last fortnight who were struggling to access housing or other basic support. She described the case of a family who had arrived on the family visa scheme but whose relative was a disabled woman with very little money, meaning they weren't able to live with her. The charity has placed them with a host informally. ""We've got a number of families in that situation appealing to us for help. Not all families are going to have the means to support their relatives. Communities are scrambling to help these people. This work isn't formally funded by anyone. The government isn't helping,"" she said. ""We are happy as a charity to support people, but it shouldn't be the role of a small charity to support traumatised and bewildered Ukrainians families and their hosts. They are being supported in a totally different way to those coming through the Homes for Ukraine scheme."" Ms Williams said the ""only way"" to prevent Ukrainians from becoming homeless and falling into ""real destitution"" was to allow them to apply to the sponsorship scheme from within the UK. ""They need that state support to ensure that people can meet their essential needs as soon as they get here. Everybody is escaping the same war,"" she added. Figures released by the Local Government Association (LGA) this week revealed that at least 144 newly arrived Ukrainian households had presented as homeless since the start of the war, of whom 44 arrived under the family scheme, 36 under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and 64 whose status is unknown. Fewer than two-thirds of all councils responded to the survey, so the true figure is likely to be higher. Oleksandr Polishchuk, a volunteer at Support Ukraine, a charity in London, said it was helping dozens of refugees who were struggling to access basic services on arrival to Britain. ""In many cases they don't have cash, they don't speak English. It's complicated. Sometimes they need housing, they need clothing. In most cases they've come with a bag, but not much,"" he said. ""Some need medication and they don't know where to get it from. People are struggling to get their kids into schools. They don't know how to apply for benefits. The language barrier is huge. The government isn't offering support with this. It introduced a policy and left it to local authorities to implement it. We're identifying the breakages and working with the councils to fix them, but each council is different, some are less advanced."" He called on the government to enable people already in the UK to switch to the sponsorship scheme: ""There are tons of people who will take them. This is a nation which gave the Kindertransport. We're in that situation. There are so many people who want to help. ""Ukrainians don't want to be a burden. They didn't come here to be on benefits. They want to work, they want to earn their keep. A lot of people would apply to the sponsorship scheme if they could."" Local authorities are given £10,500 in central government funding for each refugee under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but receive no money for those arriving under the family scheme, which allows Ukrainian refugeesto join UK-based relatives. A spokesperson for the LGA said that while councils ""stand ready"" to support communities aiding those fleeing the war and help new arrivals settle in the UK, they require more funding to be able to do this. ""We are calling for councils to receive funding to support new arrivals coming under the family visa scheme, who will still need access to local services, so they can support them when they are here in both the short and long term,"" the spokesperson said. A government spokesperson said: ""Everyone coming to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine family scheme will have access to healthcare, education, benefits and job support on the same footing as UK nationals. These schemes are designed to ensure people who are coming to the UK fleeing the Russian invasion are provided with accommodation by their family or sponsor, and are only open to those applying from outside of the UK.""

As the Kremlin wages war on their eastern European neighbour, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said it was ""immoral"" to apply usual visa restrictions to Ukranians escaping war. Priti Patel called her comments ""appalling misinformation"" and said ""the facts"" were in government guidance that she shared. The document showed a visa application fee is being waived for family members of Britons who live in Ukraine and Ukrainians in the UK are being given temporary concessions when their visa expires. According to the latest estimates from the UN refugee agency, almost 116,000 have fled their homes - predominately to Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania - since Vladimir Putin declared war. Earlier this week The Independent reported that there is currently no safe and legal route for Ukrainians to travel directly from their country to the UK in order to seek asylum, unless they have close British relatives. A No 10 spokesperson said on Friday that troops had been deployed to help the humanitarian response in Poland and were ""working incredibly closely with Ukraine's neighbours"" to help support those fleeing. But they would not be drawn on any further action when asked about safe and legal routes for those wanting to seek asylum in the UK. Posting on social media yesterday, Conservative MP Julian Smith said ministers must ""welcome"" those who have been displaced, and ""make it as easy as possible to be here"". ""It's really important that the United Kingdom makes an immediate open, welcoming & warm hearted commitment of sanctuary to those who wish to leave Ukraine. ""Rip up the usual bureaucracy & let's just say they are welcome & we will make it as easy as possible to be here."" Ms Cooper also tweeted yesterday: ""Ukraine is under fire. People are fleeing war. Yet Home Office still applies normal visa restrictions inc salaries, language, close relatives."" She said this ""isn't solidarity"" with Ukraine but ""immoral"" and urged the government to ""urgently provide simple sanctuary route to UK for Ukrainians who need our help"". The government told The Independent last week it had waived language requirements for dependents of British nationals. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Britain should be prepared to take in Ukrainian refugees, saying the government has ""got this one wrong"" in continuing to apply existing visa rules. ""We must help Ukrainian people looking for safety. That is what we have always done as a country in a moment like this,"" he said. ""The government has got this one wrong. They are applying the same rules as they had before."" He called for a ""humanitarian approach"" with ""sanctuary for those who are fleeing from Russian aggression, fleeing from this invasion, fleeing for their lives"". It comes after a poll by YouGov - following the Russian invasion - found almost two-thirds of British people would support the introduction of a resettlement scheme for those fleeing Ukraine. Ms Cooper said the war was ""already having devastating consequences"", adding: ""The UK has a duty to work with our allies to provide humanitarian assistance and support to those fleeing this horrific situation."" ""We must also work with the UN Refugee Agency to make sure contingency plans are ready for further support and sanctuary schemes that will be needed and be prepared to play our part in further international action to support refugees."" Images of Downing Street and other government buildings flying Ukrainian flags posted on social media were also met with calls to ease restrictions on movement. ""Don't wave flags; waive visas,"" Sabir Zazai, the chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council, said. ""Only then will you truly stand with #Ukraine or anyone else fleeing a dreadful conflict."" In an update posted on Twitter yesterday, the Home Office said the UK government ""has an extensive visa application centre network"" in countries neighbouring Ukraine. ""Ukrainians in these countries can access these services & apply for visa under existing immigration routes,"" they said. The department added: ""We have been planning for the impact that a Russian invasion would have on visa application centres, and swift action was taken to ensure contingency plans were put in place. ""More staff have been surged to visa application centres. Dependents of [UK] nationals residents in [Ukraine] needing a UK visa can apply through the new, temporary Lviv location or through a visa application centre in nearby countries including Poland, Moldova, Romania & Hungary.""",Broadsheet,1

""It was right at the fall [of the Soviet Union],"" Kunis, who has now started a fundraiser to support Ukrainian refugees, told the Los Angeles Times in 2008. ""It was very communist, and my parents wanted my brother and me to have a future, and so they just dropped everything. They came with $250."" Kunis was born in 1983 in the city of Chernivtsi in southwestern Ukraine to Mark and Elvira Kunis, respectively a mechanical engineer and a physics teacher. Once in the US, her father ""did odd jobs - painting houses, installing toilets and delivering pizza - while her mother worked in the back room of a Thrifty drugstore"", the LA Times reported. Kunis has said she initially struggled to adapt to the US as a child. Her native language was Russian, and she didn't speak English when her family emigrated. ""Ultimately, I adjusted fairly quickly and fairly well,"" Kunis told the LA Times. ""But it must have been hard, because I blocked out second grade completely. I have no recollection of it. I always talk to my mom and my grandma about it. It was because I cried every day. I didn't understand the culture. I didn't understand the people. I didn't understand the language."" She lated described the experience in an essay she wrote to get into college, urging the reader to ""imagine being blind and deaf at age seven."" ""That's kind of what it felt like moving to the States,"" Kunis added in her conversation with the LA Times. ""But I got over it pretty fast."" Kunis took acting classes as a child and got her first television credit in 1994 in the soap opera Days of Our Lives. Appearances in programmes such as Baywatch and 7th Heaven followed, and in 1998 she joined the cast of That '70s Show. (Also starring in the series was Ashton Kutcher, whom Kunis married in 2015). Kunis also forged a career on the film side, which has included roles in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), Black Swan (2010), Friends with Benefits (2011), and The Spy Who Dumped Me (2018).

Over 6,000 people in Northern Ireland have signed up for the UK Government's Homes for Ukraine programme. This allows individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to bring people escaping the war to safety - even if they have no ties to the UK. It means a ""substantial"" number of people could be housed in the country, with estimates suggesting the figure could reach at least 9,000 if the UK takes 10% of those fleeing the country. Senior officials from the Executive Office (TEO) said on Friday afternoon: ""We're working on the basis that this will be significantly larger and more complex than the Syrian refugee scheme where we welcomed and settled over 2,000 refugees on a staggered and planned basis."" It's just me guessing off the top of my head, but I think the key message from the Home Office is this is not going to be an elongated process, it is a genuinely truncated process compared with foreign visa arrangements TEO official Anyone with a room or home available for at least six months can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family, although those offering to host will be vetted and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. It was said that schemes will take a personal and family-centred approach, ensuring refugees are treated with respect, allowing them equal access to public services and ensuring they can learn English to properly integrate. Ukrainians will be asked for their details, including whether they have a criminal record, much like a visa application. Asked how long the process will take, a TEO official told journalists: ""We're hearing suggestions that it certainly won't be weeks, it will be more in days, possibly hours. ""It's just me guessing off the top of my head, but I think the key message from the Home Office is this is not going to be an elongated process, it is a genuinely truncated process compared with foreign visa arrangements.""

The Government is working with a number of charities and NGOs to work out the best way to match people who are not yet connected with Ukrainians. There is no limit to how many people can apply. Another TEO official said: ""Safeguarding is clearly of supreme importance and all of us and the Home Office will be doing a standard DBS check. ""We will be following up quickly with further checks, more advanced checks with visitors to ensure that their premises and the accommodation is suitable. ""Really importantly we recognise there will be bumps in the road down the line in some of these relationships and we want to be in a position to be able to support people to work through those, so the safeguarding aspect is is key.""",Broadsheet,1

A swathe of unregulated Facebook pages have been set up designed to ""match"" people who have fled Ukraine and hope to find a temporary home in Britain with UK residents who are willing to house them. In many cases young women are posting photographs of themselves, sometimes with their children, on the public Facebook groups appealing for an offer of housing from people in the UK, to which any Facebook user can reply. The government launched the sponsorship scheme on Friday, with the application page stating that Ukrainian nationals and their family members may apply only if they have a ""named sponsor"". The scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family links to come to the UK and be hosted by members of the public, who will be paid £350 per month for sharing their homes. More than 150,000 people have so far registered their interest in hosting refugees who have fled Ukraine. There is no official mechanism or portal by which refugees and prospective hosts can be linked up. When announcing the scheme last week, minister for levelling up Michael Gove saidhe hoped individuals and community groups would be able to ""match"" with refugees using social media, adding that charities would help with the process. The Independent has discovered at least a dozen Facebook pages that have subsequently been set up designed to enable this matching process, many of which already have thousands of members. They are filled with posts by both prospective hosts advertising their offer of accommodation and Ukrainian refugees appealing for housing. Jenni Regan, chief executive at iMix, which represents refugee and asylum charities in the UK, said the emergence of the Facebook groups threw up ""a lot of issues"", describing the approach as ""almost like a Tinder for people traffickers"". ""Many of the Ukrainians seeking refuge are young women who are already incredibly vulnerable. It feels like protections against sexual exploitation and violence have been completely forgotten, which is terrifying. We know that this has already been a problem for those leaving Ukraine and travelling into neighbouring countries,"" she said. Ms Regan said the charity was also seeing potential hosts from the UK get ""frustrated"" when offers of help are rejected. She added: ""We noted that one user claimed it was like a bidding war with far more supply than demand and with a bias towards people wanting to be hosted in London. We are seeing the goodwill of the British public being eroded by the process. ""There are also several unregulated sites that have popped up over the weekend offering to match people. If people are drawn to these in favour of those backed by charities with experience and knowledge of resettlement, such as the Reset Homes for Ukraine site, we could soon see the process become commercialised with people paying for a service which is currently free."" Explaining that there was also evidence of scammers potentially using the scheme, Ms Regan said: ""To apply for the scheme both sides must provide information such as passports and bills. In the wrong hands, this data could be gold dust for potential identity theft."" The government has said that any sponsor wishing to house Ukrainians will be subject to Home Office checks before any visa is issued, with adults in the house of a sponsor required to complete DBS checks and an enhanced DBS check for families hosting children or vulnerable adults. But ministers are being urged by charities to work with the third sector to go further and create an ""official, central"" way of matching people hoping to use the scheme. Lauren Agnew, trafficking policy expert at CARE (Christian Action Research and Education), said that while it was ""heartening"" to see the ""generous"" response from people across the UK keen to play their part in supporting refugees, the potential problems with the approach being taken could ""not be ignored"". ""The government may not be endorsing hosts seeking out refugees to sponsor on social media, but the current system will nevertheless create an environment for this to happen.A system allowing the public to identify refugees to host presents an opportunity to bad actors seeking to take advantage of them,"" she said. ""Already, we are seeing unregulated groups and accounts springing up on social media.Human traffickers can masquerade on these sites as genuine individuals wanting to help when, in reality, they are online to 'shop' for their next victims to exploit.How can Ukrainians know groups or individuals presenting on social media are genuine and safe?"" Ms Agnew said it was the government's job to ""close those gaps before any harm is done"", and called on ministers to ""work with expert groups to identify what action is needed"". ""It is also incredibly important that the government uses its channels to urge refugees not to interact with groups and private individuals on social media. Instead, they should seek help through official websites affiliated to the government or reputable NGOs,"" she added. A spokesperson for the department for levelling up, said: ""All those offering to house Ukrainians will be subject to Home Office checks before any visa is issued. ""Adults in the house of a sponsor will also be required to complete DBS checks, with an enhanced DBS with barred list check for families hosting children or vulnerable adults. We will keep these checks under review.""",Broadsheet,1

The government is preparing to announce emergency measures to make it easier for the victims of war to keep their cats and dogs with them rather than abandoning them in countries en route to the UK, such as Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Germany. With more than 2.5 million Ukrainians having been forced to leave the country, sources say ministers will waive the strict rule that requires owners to have a pet passport or health certificate to bring in their pets. It's thought the government is also set to announce it will cover the cost of vaccines including for rabies. In addition, quarantine costs will be free - and officials are considering setting up a new system of home quarantine if demand exceeds places in UK quarantine facilities. Ukrainian dogs and cats that have already been vaccinated should not need to be quarantined. British animal-protection activists have been lobbying the government to relax entry restrictions on pets belonging to those fleeing war. The government move is understood to be considered a trade-off for the government's dropping the flagship Animals Abroad Bill , which would have banned imports of real fur, body parts from trophy-hunting, foie gras and shark fins, as well as adverts for elephant rides. Under the UK's rules, owners may to enter or return to Britain with a pet cat, dog or ferret only if the animal has been microchipped, has a pet passport or health certificate and has been vaccinated against rabies. Normally, animals from Ukraine would also need a blood test for rabies at least three months before travelling. But it's understood these requirements will all be waived. The government is preparing to unveil a system of paying British people £350 a month for hosting refugees from Ukraine. And officials are working with vets and quarantine facilities to look at ways to support incoming pet owners.  Last week lobbyists wrote to animal-welfare minister Zac Goldsmith and environment secretary George Eustice, calling for an emergency pet passport scheme and offering help in setting up cat and dog health check systems.  They warned that forcing people already devastated by war to potentially leave their beloved animals to die would deepen their trauma. Dominic Dyer in his letter: ""If UK policy remains that no companion animals can enter the UK with refugees, we could see tens of thousands of dogs and cats having to be euthanised in Poland, Hungary and Romania in the weeks ahead. ""Each of these animal deaths would bring further misery to the women and children who have escaped war and would make Britain's immigration policy look extremely cruel in comparison to other EU member states."" The International Fund for Animal Welfare has estimated up to half of Ukrainian families fleeing are pet owners. If the rules on microchipping and paperwork are not followed, any pet would normally be put in quarantine for up to four months, under the UK's strict measures to keep the country rabies-free. A government spokesperson said: spokesperson said: ""We recognise the difficult and distressing situation that Ukrainian nationals currently face, and the UK government is working at pace to support them.  ""We have strong biosecurity measures in place to protect the public and other animals from diseases which can be brought to the UK by animals from overseas.  ""The government is looking at options to provide support to Ukrainian nationals who are entering the UK with their pets."" Mimi Bekhechi, vice-president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), welcomed the decision, saying its workers in Poland and Ukraine had ""seen first-hand the dangerous lengths that people are going to to bring their animals with them when fleeing"". She said: ""It's only right that the UK be a place of safe harbour for them.

The announcement was made in the House of Commons by Home Office minister Kevin Foster, who claimed that the government was making ""significant progress"" in responding to the refugee crisis and had now processed more than 500 Ukrainian applicants for sanctuary in the UK. But the minister -who suggested at the outset of the invasion that Ukrainians fleeing war could apply for visas to pick fruit in the UK -was blasted by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. She condemned the Home Office for a bureaucratic and ""chaotic"" response which had seen hundreds of desperate people turned away at Calais as they tried to reach the UK. Ms Cooper welcomed the extension of the family visa scheme, which was initially limited to spouses, partners, children under 18 and parents of under-18s but was later expanded to include grandparents and children over 18. But she told the Commons that the Home Office should now ""issue emergency visas for Ukrainians -all family but not just family -so they can come here and the UK can do our historic bit to help refugees fleeing war in Europe, as we've done before"". Mr Foster rejected calls for visas to be waived, telling MPs that people had already been detected at Calais with false documents, trying to get through immigration checks by pretending to be Ukrainian. He suggested that this might be a route for Russia to infiltrate dangerous people into the UK. To groans of disbelief from opposition MPs, Mr Foster said: ""I appreciate that some may think that's not an issue, but we only need to look at some of the statements coming out the Kremlin to see which countries are very much in the crosshairs of Mr Putin's Russian regime."" In reference to the poison attack on former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, he urged MPs to ""look back a short period of time to see the impact on this country of attacks by those pretending they came here to look at a cathedral spire"". But Scottish National Party home affairs spokesperson Stuart McDonald retorted: ""Don't quote Salisbury at us. That has absolutely nothing to do with this.""

2036,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,14/6/2022,766 words,Sunny Hundal,Voices: Why are we treating Syrians so differently to Ukrainian refugees?,"Last month, 25-year-old Andriy Kovalenko just about managed to escape the city of Mariupol as Russians were advancing, and made his way to Poland. But the refugee camps were overflowing, so he made his way further west, towards Germany and eventually France. There, he made some friends and decided that, because he knew some broken English, he would make his way into Britain. He had heard good things about the country in the media and was hopeful he would be welcomed. But as he was making his way across the English Channel, in a boat full of other refugees, they were stopped. Now the government wants to deport him to Rwanda for processing. As one of the first deportation flights to Rwanda gets under way, he may be on it.  Surely, most right thinking people would be outraged by the prospect of us deporting a desperate and deserving asylum seeker such as Andriy to Rwanda? After all, his land is being bombarded and destroyed, and he just travelled across a continent for safety, only to find out he was being shipped off to a country run by a cruel dictator.  Now, imagine if we did the same to a Syrian refugee. Their country is in the exact same situation : being bombed by Vladimir Putin to help the dictator Bashar al-Assad maintain control. Entire towns have been blown into smithereens exactly like Mariupol. Millions of Syrians simply have nowhere to live. The neighbouring countries are already overflowing with refugees, so some have gone further away to find shelter. And yet, while Boris Johnson was adamant that no Ukrainian refugee would end up going to Rwanda, his home secretary is currently trying to deport Syrians to Rwanda. I made up the story of Andriy Kovalenko – there’s no such case as far as I know – to illustrate a point: while Syrians and Ukrainians are largely in the same situation, there is a huge difference in how our government is treating them. For one, British people are being actively encouraged to take Ukrainian refugees into their homes to house them in Britain –we’re even being paid to do so.  Some might argue that we have more obligation towards fellow Europeans than to those escaping conflict in the Middle East or further away like South Asia. I wouldn’t necessarily call that racist – I think it’s ok to say we have added obligation towards our neighbours. But the same argument was made against Jews escaping Nazi Germany (which is why we only allowed in the children ) and the same argument was made against Asians escaping persecution from Idi Amin in Uganda. And yet, German Jews and Ugandan Asians – along with people from Hong Kong and Vietnam and many other refugees from across the world – have made Britain their home and contributed immensely towards British life and prosperity. We should treat people according to their need, not their proximity. We should treat Syrians and Ukrainians equally – only that would be fair. If the scheme to deport refugees to Rwanda makes you uncomfortable, it should do. The cruelty is the point. Priti Patel and Johnson don’t care how much it costs, they think it sends a strong message and will act as a deterrent. But the same was said about Theresa May’s “hostile environment” policies and they didn’t deter anyone either. The British government’s starkly different approach towards Ukrainian and Syrian refugees should make us think twice. Do we want to be known for our generosity and fairness, or a country that doesn’t think twice about locking up refugees in a detention camp in a dictatorship?  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here I don’t believe the public supports this government’s cruelty. But they have been sold a lie that this is the only “tough decision” possible to stop trafficking and the channel deaths. That has already proven to be false.  If this government was intent on stopping trafficking, it would go after the traffickers, not the desperate refugees. If there are too many refugees being housed in hotels, it’s because the home office has been shown to be incapable of processing people quickly and letting them earn their own living. Instead they are left in limbo, forced to rely on the state when they would prefer to be self-sufficient. The Andriy Kovalenko I mentioned earlier may have been fictitious, but the story of his journey is shared by thousands of refugees. And it’s undoubtedly a story of refugees being treated differently because of their origin. That’s a story that should shame this government and its supporters.",Broadsheet,1
2039,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,9/5/2022,1142 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,'Chaos': Ukrainian refugees placed with unvetted hosts,"Ukrainian refugees have been placed with unvetted hosts and in unsuitable homes because the government has yet to give councils any funding for vital safety checks. Hosting arrangements under the Homes for Ukraine route are already breaking down, as it emerged the required DBS background checks are not always being done before refugees arrive in the UK. Families who have fled the war have been forced to pay for hotel rooms or register as homeless after discovering their sponsor's housing is unsuitable, with reports of rodent infestations, broken boilers and hosts with drug addictions. One Ukrainian woman arrived at her London host's house to discover she had only a 5 sq m bedroom to share with her six-year-old son, the heating was broken and there were mice running around. The host also refused to give her a key to the property. The home was later inspected by the local council and deemed to be unsuitable, and they were moved into temporary accommodation. The Independent's Refugees Welcome campaign is calling for the government to go further and faster to help Ukrainians fleeing their country. Government data shows 19,500 of the 80,900 people who have applied have so far arrived under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which opened on 18 March and enables refugees to ""match"" with UK residents willing to house them. A further 17,900 of the 44,200 refugees who have applied under the Ukraine family scheme have arrived, since the initiative allowing them to join UK-based relatives was launched on 4 March. The Home Office conducts checks against the police national computer before granting a Homes for Ukraine visa, but DBS checks and property inspections are carried out later by local authorities. Councils are supposed to receive £10,500 per refugee to assist with those checks - at least one of which should be in person and happen before refugees arrive. But the government's own guidance states the payments will not be made until the end of June, which means they often aren't being done until after refugees arrive. The Independent understands some local authorities have subsequently had to redeploy staff from family and children's social services to carry out the checks. Shadow levelling up minister Lisa Nandy said it was ""shameful"" the government had ""wasted so much generosity and let down the people of Ukraine by continually failing to get a grip and do its job"". ""The government has failed to provide the information and support that people on the front line need to make this scheme work,"" she said. ""The result is chaos, unacceptable delays and potentially homelessness for desperate people who have already fled a terrible war."" Hannah Clare, deputy leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, said because the council was yet to receive its funding and it was not provided with information on where a host lives and when the refugee will arrive, checks were taking place ""a matter of weeks rather than days"" after refugees get here. ""It's not possible for us to complete the property checks before they arrive, so it is happening after, which isn't ideal,"" she said. ""We've had a case where that relationship's broken down before we could do that check, showing just how important it is. It really doesn't protect the refugees, or the hosts either. It's a danger all round."" In one case, Natalie, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, arrived in the UK at the start of April with her son, aged six, after matching with a female host through social media. But she was shocked at the living conditions when she arrived at the south London home. ""It was really dirty. We were shown the bedroom we would share and it was about five square metres. The window was very narrow - you couldn't open it to get fresh air,"" she told The Independent. ""The boiler wasn't working, so after the flight we couldn't shower. She gave us double blankets, but it was so cold. I noticed the house was full of mice. They were running around, but what could we do? I was in another country. It was 10 or 11pm."" Sutton Council carried out a property check the next day and Natalie was told the home was unsuitable and she would be moved into emergency accommodation within a few days. In the meantime, Natalie faced more challenges. ""She [the host] wouldn't give me a key. One day we went out and when we came back in the evening she was out. She wasn't replying to my messages. We were so cold. It was a Sunday so there was no cafe or anything around."" The pair have since been moved to temporary accommodation where they feel more settled. ""We just wanted to live a normal life, but we came from war to that trouble,"" she said. Sutton Council said visas were issued before checks are completed and because it does not receive information on when refugees are due to arrive, it was difficult for it prioritisechecks for imminent arrivals. The Local Government Association said councils across the country had reported issues with the information they get from the government, saying it is arriving too slowly, there is data missing, host contact details are not always correct and it does not provide refugees' arrival dates. Svitlana Opanasenko, a volunteer at Ukraine Social Club,said one young Ukrainian man arrived at a host property to find someone in the family was taking drugs. ""He said he couldn't stay there. He booked a hotel for three nights, but he didn't have money to stay longer. He was looking for a family to stay with, and eventually, luckily, he found one,"" she said. ""He reported it to the local council and it turns out they didn't check the sponsor, and then they realised it was not suitable."" Ms Opanasenko also described cases where hosts have told refugees they need to do chores in the home to ""repay the service"". She asked: ""Why is there no database for people to match with hosts who have already been checked?"" A government spokesperson said it would seek to find a further sponsor if a sponsor/guest relationship broke down, and if a suitable one could not be found, refugees would be entitled to housing support. ""We are giving councils £10,500 per person to provide wrap-around support for Ukrainians on the scheme. They must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property and they have a duty to make sure the guest is safe and well once they've arrived"" the spokesperson said. The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

Health Secretary Humza Yousaf explained the move was part of efforts to ensure that those fleeing the Russian invasion receive the ""warmest welcome possible"". An amendment to current legislation means that refugees from Ukraine will be able to access health care, including maternity care, mental health services and treatment for specific conditions at no charge while in Scotland. The Scottish Government has also stressed this will apply to people from Ukraine who were in Scotland on short term visas when the war began and have had to extend their stay as it is not safe for them to return home. Further to this, anyone is entitled to free emergency treatment at A&E, regardless of their nationality, residence status or the length of time they have been in the country, with people also able to register with a GP to receive care there free of charge Emergency legislation has also come into force which will allow those coming to Scotland from Ukraine to meet the residency conditions to Scottish social security benefits. This means those fleeing the war will be immediately able to claim payments such as the Scottish Child Payment and Child Disability Payment, if eligible for them. With millions of people having fled Ukraine in the wake of the Russian invasion, Mr Yousaf, speaking on behalf of the Scottish Government, said: ""We are determined to do everything in our power to give displaced people from Ukraine the warmest welcome possible when they arrive and this includes offering healthcare to those who need it. ""We fully recognise that they may have been through very traumatic experiences and could require specialist treatment and care. ""Removing charges for healthcare and providing access to benefits is a practical step in ensuring those who have been forced to flee their homes and country can live safely and comfortably in Scotland for as long as they need to.""",Broadsheet,1

However, the levelling up minister conceded there would be a ""high legal bar to cross"" in using frozen assets - and suggested it could only house refugees temporarily. Asked about reports in the Daily Mail that he wants to ""seize"" mansions and use them to accommodate people fleeing the war, Mr Gove told the BBC: ""There's quite a high legal bar to cross and we're not talking about permanent confiscation."" He told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme: ""I want to explore an option which would allow us to use the homes and properties of sanctioned individuals - as long as they are sanctioned - for humanitarian and other purposes."" Mr Gove added: ""We are saying: 'You're sanctioned, you're supporting Putin, this home is here, you have no right to use or profit from it - and more than that, while you are not using or profiting from it, if we can use it in order to help others, let's do that'."" When challenged by host Sophie Raworth that oligarchs can continue to live in properties that have been frozen under sanctions - which only prevent assets from being sold - Mr Gove said: ""We've moved as rapidly as we possibly can."" The housing minister added: ""If we can use those assets for as long as someone is sanctioned, then we should."" Mr Gove's desire to use frozen property assets is reportedly being blocked by officials at the Treasury and the Foreign Office who believe it is ""not legally workable"". Ministers have understood to have expressed concerns that properties cannot be seized under current sanctions legislation. The government has imposed sanctions on 18 Putin-linked oligarchs - as well as 386 members of the Russian parliament. Foreign secretary Liz Truss has said she has a long ""hit list"" of Russians as part of a ""rolling programme"" of sanctions. Mr Gove also suggested he was personally considering offer a home to Ukrainian refugees, as he set out details of a government sponsorship route, allowing British citizens and community groups to offer up rooms and receive a ""thank you"" payment of £350 per month. Asked if he would take someone fleeing the Russian forces, the cabinet minister told the BBC: ""Yes."" He explained: ""I'm exploring what I can do, I know that there are others who have. Without going into my personal circumstances, there are a couple of things I need to sort out - but yes."" Mr Gove said there are potentially ""hundreds of thousands of people"" in the UK willing to take Ukrainians into their homes - but had earlier conceded that he expected the route would only see ""tens of thousands"" welcomed in. The housing minister also revealed that local authorities would receive £10,000 for each Ukrainian refugee it sponsors and provides support. But government has been criticised for insisting that British sponsors go through online paperwork and security checks on behalf of a particular, ""named"" refugee. Mr Gove said charities would help in the ""matching process"", and said the government believed individuals and community groups would use social media to connect and fill out online paperwork together. The Refugee Council accused the government of putting too many ""bureaucratic hurdles"" in the way - and said ""it will inevitably be restricted to those who are known to people in the UK"".",Broadsheet,1
2068,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,5/5/2022,724 words,Tom Peck,Voices: At least Matt Hancock's finally got those Ukrainian refugees he wanted,"Fans of Matt Hancock , of which there may theoretically be some, were left disappointed two months ago when the big man's big comeback, via a business podcast hosted by the newest cast member on Dragons' Den, was overshadowed by Vladimir Putin's suspiciously timed invasion of Ukraine.  But, on the vanishingly small off-chance these fans exist, they needn't have worried. Their hero would never be one to not turn a crisis into an opportunity (which is the sort of thing people say on business podcasts, when they're not instead having to talk about snogging one of their staff on CCTV), and he has now managed to turn the war in Ukraine to his advantage. It is not entirely clear whether a single fleeing Ukrainian had made it to the Polish border before Matt Hancock began writing a seemingly never ending succession of newspaper articles about his desperation to host a Ukrainian family. On one such occasion, I may myself have written an article on the subject, in which I may have asked the question, in the headline, as to whether these people had not already suffered enough. And on that occasion, I may then also have been contacted by Matt Hancock's ""team"", who felt it all to be very unfair, that he was ""doing a decent thing"" and that he was damned if he did, and damned if he didn't. Politeness appears to have prevented me from pointing out that one option worth considering would be simply to apply to host the family in question without any accompanying newspaper articles or TV appearances, thus rendering him exactly as damned and undamned as the other 500,000 or so people in the country who had managed to do just that. Still, never mind. Because here we are, just a few weeks later, and somehow Matt Hancock has managed to find himself among the lucky ones whose application to host a Ukrainian family has somehow made it through the Home Office's systems. And readers of this week's Spectator magazine are even luckier, gifted as they have been with yet another full page article, all about life in the Hancock household which now has fully seven Ukrainian refugees and their four dogs living in it. Team Hancock can have no complaints about the headline this time. ""It takes courage to be vulnerable,"" it states. The readers, on the other hand, may not be disappointed but possibly bemused when they discover, roughly three-fifths of the way through, that the courage and vulnerability in question refers not to the courage required to run for your life in the middle of relentless Russian shelling, but rather the courage of Matt Hancock, to travel to the Royal Palace in Stockholm and give a talk alongside various princesses from various countries. (The subject of said talk was Hancock's own dyslexia, a noble topic on which he now finds time to campaign, and with considerable success. He has, he said, managed to build support ""across the spectrum"" including from the current education secretary, 54-year-old Nadhim Zahawi , the former CEO of YouGov and owner of a personal property empire thought to be worth north of £100m. ""One day he'll go far,"" notes Matt.)  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here Look, none of this, per se, is Matt Hancock's fault. It's not his fault he was the last nice guy standing when politics went to the dark side. It's not his fault that his relentless optimism and even more relentless relaunches have come to resemble the attempts of Rob Brydon's divorced cab driver character, Keith, from the outstanding sitcom Marion & Geoff, who will only ever look on the bright side of everything as his life falls apart around him. In one particular scene, Keith produces his collection of audio cassettes that he's recorded himself, of solo trips to Chessington and Longleat Safari Park, to post to his children on the basis that they'd probably like to go there. ""In this age of digital technology,"" he says, ""it's almost like I'm on a computer game with them or something. I'm like a virtual dad, and with virtual dad, they can switch me off if they want to."" And he's right, they can.

2074,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,9/3/2022,814 words,Tom Peck,Voices: Priti Patel is blind to her own cruelty over Ukrainian refugees - but we should've seen this coming,"As we stare down the barrel of yet another horrific global catastrophe, it feels as if we are in that now-familiar phase in which there is a knee-jerk reaction of outrage should anyone dare to criticise the government. As if to do so would be somehow unpatriotic.  Trouble is, we've been here before. It is not yet two years since vitriol was heaped upon anyone who dared to whisper that Boris Johnson didn't have a clue what he was doing. That he should have locked down faster. That, dare one even think it, those giant Nightingale hospitals were a crass PR stunt. A multi-storey car park full of beds, but no one to staff them. And if you dare to suggest, again, that Johnson is floundering in the dark, making it up as he goes along, you can expect more of the same. Even though what Johnson does is exactly the same. If in doubt - and he is always in doubt - just claim that you're ""leading the world"". Heard that one before? At Prime Minister's Questions, he was, unsurprisingly, expected to account for the fact that the UK is once again making a fool of itself on the subject of immigration, and in this case, refugee status for Ukrainians fleeing war. Every other comparable country has opened its arms and flung open its borders. According to a Guardian reporter at a Romanian airport on Wednesday morning, every flight out was full of Ukrainian refugees; be it to Frankfurt or even to Dublin. Except for the flight to London Luton, for the sole reason that this was the only destination that required visas to have been processed prior to take off. So what was Johnson's answer? ""We have done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country since 2015,"" he said. This is such preposterous garbage it is incredibly offensive. It hardly needs to be repeated that in 2016, Germany granted asylum to a million Syrian refugees, while Johnson's Brexit pals exploited their appalling deaths in the Mediterranean to win their referendum. The prime minister has also yet to provide any kind of reasonable explanation for why independent reports have concluded that he personally intervened to assist in the evacuation of dogs from Afghanistan, ahead of actual human beings who had assisted British armed forces (one of whom drowned when his dinghy capsized in the Channel a few weeks later.) While he spoke, news reporters in Ukraine and in the towns over its borders were reduced to sitting on telephone helplines to assist desperate families who didn't speak English, only to be told, in the end, that they couldn't be helped. After Prime Minister's Questions, the PM's spokesperson was on hand to explain exactly what was happening with regard to Ukrainian refugees trying to get to Britain, as the details that had come to light were so preposterous and so egregious that could hardly be believed. But the reality was worse. There will still be no visa processing centre in Calais, because to have one there would apparently incentivise people to go there. There is to be a ""pop up"" centre in Lille, 75 miles away, but it will be by appointment only. Appointments will be virtually impossible to secure, and the location of this centre will remain secret. Naturally, this is all the work of Priti Patel. And sadly, we must return, once again to the now home secretary's appearance on BBC Question Timemore than ten years ago. Back then, she was arguing in favour of the death penalty, because she is simply that cruel; and when it was pointed out to her, by Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, that wherever the death penalty still exists, innocent people are executed, she didn't appear to appreciate the points being put to her. It is always worth rewatching , because it is frankly the best way to understand why the Home Office functions in the way it does. Because it is run by someone who is not merely cruel by nature, but who doesn't seem to recognise how cruel she is. And it is also worth recalling that she has been sacked once for endangering national security , and when the adviser on ministerial standards found her to have broken the ministerial code, he resigned because she wasn't sacked again. All this is preventable, of course it is. Things could very easily be better. On Tuesday evening, Johnson led two separate standing ovations in the House of Commons to the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Last week, he also rose to applaud the Ukrainian ambassador, who was in the public gallery at Prime Minister's Questions. A week later, the same man, Vadym Prystaiko, was giving evidence to a parliamentary committee about how even he, the actual ambassador, had struggled to acquire a UK visa for his wife. And while all this goes on, Ukrainian people trek halfway across France and back, trying to find a pop up visa centre that's been deliberately hidden from them. It really is world-beating stuff, though not quite in the way the prime minister imagines.",Broadsheet,0
2084,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,22/4/2022,487 words,Alistair Mason,'Kindness backpacks' bring 'moments of happiness' to young Ukrainian refugees,"Two British friends have raised more than £4,000 to fund ""kindness backpacks"" given out to Ukrainian refugee children in Poland. Stuart Thomas, 43, and Neil Spalding, 30, travelled earlier this month to help out at a humanitarian aid centre set up at the Warsaw Expo Centre in Poland's capital, where refugees stay briefly after leaving Ukraine before moving on to more permanent locations. While there they were involved in putting together and distributing the so-called kindness backpacks, which were the brainchild of one of the women working at the centre, Marta Szyjkowska, and are designed to be both fun for the displace children as well as practical. As most of those at the centre will undertake bus journeys of up to 40 hours to their next location, the bags contain things to keep them entertained on the trip like toys and games, as well as gifts from shops including Claire's Accessories and bars of chocolate. The backpacks will also function as schoolbags when the children reach their next destination. Mr Thomas, who works in business-to-business exhibitions, told the PA news agency: ""Marta came up the idea that she wanted children, when they're leaving the relocation centres, to have a couple of things. ""She wanted them to have something to do on that bus journey, and she also wants them to feel a moment of kindness - the fact that people really cared about them."" Mr Thomas and Mr Spalding, from Clapton in east London , spent the first couple of days in Warsaw helping to put the bags together. They were then given the job of handing out bags to youngsters leaving the centre - the first time they had visited where the refugees were sleeping. Mr Thomas, from Stansted Mountfitchet, in Essex, said: ""We turned the corner and I think in my life I've never just frozen by being so overwhelmed with emotion, because there's people who are just... uncontrollable tears, you know when people cry but uncontrollably? ""I've got two young boys, I've got boys that are 11 and eight, and so a couple of these boys got off the bus together and one of them, my lad plays football all the time and this lad obviously did as well, he's got all the Adidas sports stuff on and I was like 'that's just my boy there'. ""So I think the first time, we found it exceptionally difficult and I'd say we're pretty useless actually."" During their week at the centre, Mr Thomas said the pair, who became friends through playing rugby and cricket together, helped to hand out between 400 and 500 bags. But with stocks running low, they are now raising funds to be able to distribute more when they return to the centre next week. Mr Thomas said the packs were ""massively appreciated"" by both the children who received them and their parents. ""We're not changing the world and I completely get that, but it's creating small moments of happiness,"" Mr Thomas added.

The Edinburgh Pentland MSP said: ""In my constituency, around the Dreghorn and Redford barracks, there are many MoD family homes that have been left empty for many years."" And he asked the First Minister to support his call for the ""UK Government to consider the use of hundreds of empty MoD homes in Edinburgh and across Scotland to house people being displaced as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine"".

She is rushing to her new job. From a small hostel room in eastern Warsaw, Hibska, a Ukrainian refugee, is slowly rebuilding her life, which was abruptly upended by Russia 's invasion of her homeland. European Union member nations like Poland and Romania - the two neighbouring countries to have received the most refugees from Ukraine - have launched programs to help them integrate. The 47-year-old former manager of a private education centre from Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine, Hibska fled her hometown after a second wave of shelling.  When bombs struck a nearby military warehouse, rattling her home, she knew it was time to leave and seek refuge for herself and her 11-year-old son. ""We were afraid to go out, to let them go out into the yard, we were afraid to let them ride bicycles or play football.  ""We were just so scared and we decided that that was enough. It was time to flee,"" she said, describing the decision she and many of her neighbours were forced to take. With only some basic belongings they embarked on what became a challenging five-day journey to the safety of Poland. Three weeks on, and by a combination of help extended by ordinary people in Poland and policies put in place at the national and municipal level, Hibska and her son are starting to feel safe. They have a simple yet welcoming home. Her son is enrolled at a local school, and she has started a new job as cook at a Ukrainian food bar launched specially to provide employment to refugees. The workday starts early with food preparation ahead of the lunchtime rush. Hibska and the five other Ukrainian women working here, all recently arrived refugees, roll out dough and chop fillings for traditional Ukrainian dumplings, pelmeni, that are a staple. ""I used to have five people working for me and I organised (youth) camps,"" she said, reflecting on her past life in Kharkiv. ""I am not embarrassed by the fact that currently I am working in a kitchen."" Warsaw city authorities say work helps refugees integrate but is also filling vacancies in the health sector and in education, where special classes are being launched to assist newly arrived Ukrainian children. Of the more than 4 million refugees that have fled Ukraine, over 2.4 million have crossed into Poland. While many have travelled onward throughout Europe, plenty have stayed in Poland which is offering free temporary accommodation, medical care, education and some social benefits. Some 625,000 refugees have sought and obtained Polish ID numbers entitling them to all that for 18 months. But living off benefits was not something Nataliya would accept for too long. ""Volunteers help us with everything. We can live off Poland, but I don't see that as a good thing,"" she said. "" I need to work. You won't get much doing nothing."" Her new job helps provide for her and her son, Roman, and anything left over she hopes to send to her parents and husband, still living in Kharkiv. Her good fortune in Poland was thanks to a free hostel run by a family of developers and hotel owners. The same company launched a Ukrainian food bar specifically to provide jobs to refugees. The place opened 10 days ago and is quickly gaining in fame, with customers intent on helping Ukrainians all the while enjoying a good meal. ""The forms of help are evolving"" said Karolina Samulowska awaiting her order. ""At first there was aid, sandwiches, railway stations."" Now, at the bar ""on the one hand the products are here and promote the country, on the other hand the money moves on, giving meaning to the refugees' lives."" As a regular flow of customers comes by to pick up lunch, the restaurant's manager, Dorota Wereszczynska, reflects on the success. ""We were not expecting such popularity,"" she said. ""Our motto is ""You buy. You eat. You help."" Further south on Europe's map, Romania has taken in more than 600,000 refugees from Ukraine. Flavia Boghiu, the deputy mayor of the central city of Brasov, says the key to integration is to help people be ""as autonomous as possible."" The city's refugee centres offer support and information on work offers, kindergartens and other activities, she told the AP, and local authorities proudly boast that of 1,200 refugees who arrived in the city, more than 75 per cent want to stay. The employment process is ""much slower than normal, because most of them don't have paperwork with them. Also you need to discuss with them to understand their particular situation. If you have a mother with three children you need to see what you're going to do with the children (while) she's at work,"" Boghiu said.

2104,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,19/6/2022,610 words,Zoe Tidman,"Ukrainian refugees in UK facing homelessness due to renting red tape, charity warns","Ukrainians fleeing war could face homelessness as a result of the administrative checks required to access the private rental market in the UK, charities have warned.  Tens of thousands of refugees have come to live in the country under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which enables Britons with a spare room or house to “match” with families or individuals escaping the Russian invasion.  Those offering to host Ukrainians sign up for a committment of at least six months.  Charities are now warning that refugees may face problems taking the next step of renting their own home, which could require checks that would be impossible for them to pass.  Opora, a charitable organisation that supports Ukrainians who have moved to the UK, is reported to have said it has been contacted by refugees who cannot access private lettings because of failed referencing checks.  A couple from Lviv, Dmytro Chapovski and his wife Polina, told The Guardian they were struggling to find somewhere to rent after moving to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.  Their host in Shropshire, Janet Duchesne, told the newspaper that a dozen letting agents had said the Ukrainian couple had “no chance of letting in this country”.  Mr Chapovski told The Guardian he had eventually found an agency willing to let to him, but then needed to show proof of earnings and a tax history in the UK – which, having arrived in April, he does not have – or provide 12 months’ rent upfront. Stanislav Benes, from the Opora network, is reported as saying that the government needs to support landlords to rent to Ukrainians and set up a guarantor scheme for the refugees, who are at risk of homelessness if such action is not taken.  “It will overburden existing resources that are already overstretched, which means more and more people will start falling through the cracks,” he told The Guardian.  Government figures show that hundreds of Ukrainians – more than 660 households – have already been forced to register as homeless in the UK after arriving under the available schemes.  Another charity, Mums4Ukraine, warned that delays in Homes for Ukraine hosts being given a monthly £350 “thank you” payment had meant – in the most serious cases – that refugees were having to leave their accommodation.  Others have raised concerns over what happens when Ukrainians leave their host families.  Sophie Delamothe, from campaign group Generation Rent, told The Guardian: “There are so many pieces of information that you need to provide, that people who’ve just recently come to this country as refugees just might not have access to.” A government spokesperson said: “More than 77,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK since Putin’s invasion, and the vast majority are staying with sponsors or relatives. “We are carefully monitoring this situation and will work across government and with landlords to ensure Ukrainians are receiving the help they need.”  The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

2109,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,8/3/2022,710 words,Gavin Cordon,Defence officials to help process Ukrainian refugees fleeing to UK,"Defence officials are to help process visa applications from Ukrainians fleeing the war amid continuing criticism over the slow rate at which refugees are being admitted to the UK. The Home Office disclosed on Monday night that just 300 visas have been issued out of a total of 17,700 family scheme applications that have been started, 8,900 of which have been submitted. With 1.7 million people having fled the fighting so far, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace acknowledged that the Government needs to move quicker and said he is offering Ministry of Defence (MoD) support to speed up the work. ""The first and foremost duty for all of us is to make sure that people get to safety,"" he told Sky News. ""Once they've got to safety, making sure we just check their identity before they come to this country - it is incredibly important that we do that. ""It shouldn't take time. And I've offered, I will be offering, to the Home Office assistance from the MoD in the same way we did in Op Pitting (the evacuation of Afghanistan) to increase the processing time to help those people."" He added: ""Of course, we can do that quicker, we are leaning into that, the Home Secretary is determined to do that quicker, I will give her all the support I can."" Mr Wallace was also critical of reports that hundreds of Ukrainians who have reached Calais have been told they need to travel back to Paris or Brussels to apply for a visa where they face a lengthy wait. ""It's difficult for those people - why wouldn't it be? - to go all the way back to Paris,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""We can do more, we will do more."" ""It's not the case that we are only allowing 300 people in; it is the case that the system has not been quick enough, which is what we're going to address."" His comments will increase the pressure on Home Secretary Priti Patel, who is facing growing criticism over the Home Office's response in the face of a growing humanitarian crisis.  SIMPLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH. @ukhomeoffice needs to move today from pettifogging process to active delivery. Stop ""computer says no"" mindset and get on and help.

""The Home Office needs to move today from pettifogging process to active delivery. Stop 'computer says no' mindset and get on and help,"" he tweeted. The row comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hosting leaders of the Visegrad Four central European nations - Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic - who have seen some of the heaviest influxes of refugees. Meanwhile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to deliver a ""historic address"" to the House of Commons after Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle approved a request for him to speak directly to MPs. He is expected to use his speech - delivered by video link from Kyiv - to issue a renewed appeal for Western support, including a Nato no-fly zone. Britain and other allies have ruled that out, warning that it could bring Nato and Russian jets into direct conflict, potentially sparking a wider European war. Mr Wallace said that however the conflict in Ukraine played out, it was clear that Russian President Vladimir Putin was a ""spent force"". He said Mr Putin would not break the people of Ukraine and that he potentially faced decades of occupation which would be impossible to sustain. ""Whatever we think about President Putin, he is done. He is a spent force in the world. No-one will be taking his phone calls in the long term,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""He has exhausted his army, he is responsible for thousands of Russian soldiers being killed, responsible for innocent people being killed, civilians being killed in Ukraine. ""He is reducing his economy to zero, because the international community has decided that is absolutely unacceptable, what he's done. ""So he is a spent force in the world and I don't know whether he thinks that's a clever thing to be, but that diminishes his own country in the world and he has to take responsibility for that.""",Broadsheet,1
2138,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,7/3/2022,921 words,Andrew Woodcock,UK help for Ukrainian refugees appears grudging - be prepared for repeated U-turns,"BorisJohnson has claimed the UK is taking a ""very generous and open approach"" towards the 1.7 million Ukrainians who have fled their country to escape Vladimir Putin's brutal assaults on civilians. The scale of the British response, however, is coming under increasingly intense scrutiny after Home Office figures indicated at the weekend that only 50 UK visas had been issued. There was confusion in Whitehall on Monday as the prime minister suggested the figure was wrong, but could not provide a more accurate number. Suggestions from home secretary Priti Patel that she was considering a new humanitarian route for victims of the conflict also turned out to be misleading as the Home Office and No 10 clarified that she was referring to existing schemes. It is understood that around 10,000 Ukrainians had applied to come to the UK by Monday. The government insisted it is working through the backlog as quickly as possible, but offered no indication of how soon applicants can expect a decision. With Poland opening its borders, taking in 1 million Ukrainians, and the EU offering them freedoms to travel, settle and work across the 27-nation bloc, the UK's response is increasingly looking ungenerous and sluggish. Smaller countries on Ukraine 's borders have taken in far more refugees than Britain, with 180,000 in Hungary, 130,000 in Slovakia and around 80,000 each in Romania and Moldova, according to UN figures. More than 183,000 people have moved on from these countries to other destinations in Europe. France's interior minister Gerald Darmanin condemned Britain for a ""totally inadequate response"" and ""lack of humanity"" after Ukrainians trying to reach the UK were turned back at Calais. At the outset of the Ukrainian crisis, the EU immediately agreed to let in refugees for up to three years without first having to seek asylum. And last week, the bloc agreed to invoke for the first time the Temporary Protection Directive created at the time of the 2001 Kosovo crisis. This allows Ukrainians to move freely across the EU, giving them instant rights to live and work within the bloc, along with access to social service benefits like housing and medical care. Under the directive, Ukrainians are also granted temporary residency status without having to go through complex asylum procedures. In contrast, the UK has targeted specific groups of Ukrainians for assistance and has refused to lift the requirement for visas to enter Britain. A Ukraine Family Scheme launched last month for relatives of UK residents was initially available only to spouses or partners, children aged under 18 or parents of under-18s, with the government estimating it could see up to 100,000 people come to Britain. This was later extended to wider family, including grandparents, siblings, children aged over 18 and parents of over-18s, increasing the group potentially eligible to around 200,000. Entry requirements for English language skills and minimum salary were waived, but applicants were still told to provide documentation such as marriage or birth certificates. However, the Home Office made clear it was willing to consider applications without such papers from people who had fled their homes in fear for their lives. There have been complaints that refugees were told to submit their applications at UK visa processing centres such as embassies and consulates, meaning long journeys and delays for many of those hoping to come to the UK. With no centre in Calais, Ukrainians reaching the Channel have been told to go to Paris or Brussels to stake their claims. A second scheme, the Humanitarian Sponsorship Pathway, will allow access to Ukrainians with no relatives in the UK who can find sponsors - such as councils, charities or businesses - able to support them and provide accommodation during their stay. No date has yet been set for this route to open, and eligibility requirements are not yet known. Meanwhile, Ukrainians already in the UK on work and short visit visas have been told they can extend them. Johnson and Patel have fiercely resisted demands to lift the requirement for visas altogether, arguing this would create a security risk and undermine public support in the UK for the offer of sanctuary. Patel said Russian troops were ""seeking to infiltrate"" Ukrainian forces and there were ""extremists on the ground"" in Ukraine. Given Putin's ""willingness to do violence on British soil"", Patel said, ""we cannot suspend any security or biometric checks on people we welcome to our country"". As TV screens fill with scenes of civilians being deliberately targeted by Russian troops, the UK's stance risks appearing grudging and inadequate. The government risks being forced into repeated U-turns as it gradually amends and extends its offer of help to people who have no time to spare in finding a safe haven from war.

The congresswoman's remarks on Tuesday come in the backdrop of an impending humanitarian crisis in Ukraine , which has been battling an invasion by Russia on 24 February. The congresswoman said the US should ensure all refugees are equally accepted, regardless of where they come from. ""I think the world is watching and many immigrants and refugees are watching, and how the world treats Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees should be how we are treating all refugees in the United States,"" Ms Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC. While most Ukrainian citizens fleeing their country are seeking refuge in Europe , the US on Sunday pledged $54m (£41m) in humanitarian assistance. This would be channeled through nonprofits to provide food, safe drinking water, shelter and emergency healthcare, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in a statement. The congresswoman said there was a ""stark contrast"" in the way the world treated Syrian refugees versus the way Ukrainian refugees are being treated , despite both countries having gone through similar catastrophes. ""I think the way we are looking at immediate granting of TPS [Temporary Protected Status] to Ukrainian refugees, which is what we need to be doing, as well as many others, is something that we need to keep in mind,"" the Democrat leader said.

""We really need to make sure that when we talk about accepting refugees that we are meaning it for everybody, no matter where you come from,"" she said, citing the example of the unjust treatment towards Haitian refugees by the US government, including the past and the current Biden administration. The congresswoman pointed to the thousands of people who were denied legal refuge on the US-Mexico border.  ""If we grant TPS to Ukrainian refugees, it is also an opportunity to create a path to citizenship for TPS recipients... While there is a risk, there is also a profound opportunity for us to make the crooked path straight on this issue,"" she added, explaining that TPS recipients did not have a ""concrete path"" to US citizenship. On Monday, 42 senators across the party lines had asked president Joe Biden to temporarily shield those Ukrainians living in the US from deportation. The group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers said the Biden administration should offer access to TPS as the ongoing war has made it ""too dangerous"" for deportees to return. The congresswoman's remarks assume significance as several commentators call out the discriminatory manner with which international media outlets have covered the invasion and the contrast in policies that Ukraine's neighbours have adopted in granting shelter to them compared to those who seek asylum from outside Europe.",Broadsheet,1

The 14 residents and three employees who lived in the shelter were rescued from the flames when the former hotel in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania burned down Wednesday night, local police said. Nobody was injured, and the refugees were taken to other shelters, according to authorities. “One thing must be clear to everyone: People fleeing war need our protection and support. We do not tolerate incitement and violence,"" the state's governor, Manuela Schwesig, said.  Police investigating the cause of the fire were looking into possible arson, German news agency dpa reported.  On Monday, police received a report of graffiti depicting a Nazi swastika in the entrance area of the shelter. Whether the graffiti was connected to the fire is not yet known, police said. More than 1 million refugees from Ukraine, most of them women and children, went to Germany seeking protection since Russia invaded their country almost eight months ago. The refugees initially were welcomed with warmth, and many German families opened their homes to shelter them.

2168,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,7/11/2022,526 words,Thomas Kingsley,Billions spent on ‘refugees and migrants’ in UK to be counted as foreign aid,"Billions of pounds of government spending in Britain is to be counted as foreign aid. Under Treasury rules, as much as £3.5 billion for refugees and migrants in the UK will be considered part of Britain’s contribution to international development, The Times reported.  It means the government is in line to spend almost half of the foreign aid budget in Britain, leaving 0.3 per cent of gross national income to go on projects overseas – below the government target of 0.5 per cent.  Conservative MPs warned that ministers would face a backlash from the move. Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, said that the decision would “astonish many colleagues”. It comes after Save the Children speaking to The Independent warned thatbillions could be slashed from overseas aid projects unless ministers abandoned the rule diverting a portion of funds to Ukrainian refugees in the UK.  The UK’s international aid budget is £11.4 billion but under Treasury spending rules the costs of looking after asylum seekers and other refugees in Britain count towards it.  Amid the war in Ukraine and the Channel boats crisis, these costs have risen significantly, meaning that an estimated £3.5 billion will be spent to cover it. About another £1 billion of domestic spending is also classified as “aid” including research grants and scholarships. According to The Times, Andrew Mitchell, the new international development minister, is lobbying Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, to protect existing aid spending. Senior Tories have raised the prospect of rebellion over the inclusion of spending on Ukrainian refugees in the foreign aid budget. Mr Ellwood said: “There will certainly be noise now that it’s eroded from 0.7 to 0.3. [per cent].” While chancellor, Rishi Sunak, vowed that the 0.7 per cent aid target would return when the UK wasn’t borrowing for day-to-day spending and its ratio of underlying debt to GDP was fallen, however, with pressures to make spending cuts amid recession warnings, it’s likely the restoration will be pushed back further. Including those costs within the 0.5 per cent aid budget, which is already fully allocated, will result in further deep cuts in funding for those in the toughest circumstances across the world,” said Richard Watts, senior adviser for development finance. “This isn’t right. The UK government should ensure its help for refugees here does not come at the expense of support for children across the world at this critical time. It can and must step up, and not back.” Ministers have already ordered a stop to “non-essential” aid spending – partly because of the ballooning Ukraine costs – with agencies still in the dark over existing projects, with just four months left in the calendar year. Sarah Champion, chair of the House of Commons international development committee, said: “It’s absolutely right that we step up to help the people of Ukraine, but we mustn’t abandon our commitment to the world’s poorest in doing so. “We must show flexibility in increasing the 0.5 per cent target before the costs of providing much-needed help to Ukrainian refugees lead to cuts that will cause real suffering elsewhere.”",Broadsheet,1

The Taoiseach was speaking ahead of a two-day meeting of the EU’s 27 leaders in Brussels on Friday. Mr Varadkar said on the first day of the summit that some countries wanted attention to be drawn away from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and towards the threat of an escalating conflict in the Middle East. “Because of all the other things that are happening in the world, not least in the Middle East, it’d be very easy to lose focus on the war in Ukraine, and it is essential that we don’t do that,” he told reporters on Friday. “We need to continue, if not continue, double down on – our support for Ukraine, in terms of political, military, financial and other support.” He said European leaders will also discuss migration but there is no expectation of any new conclusions. He added: “We have a very strong view that Ukraine has a right to defend its sovereignty, its independence, its democracy. “If we don’t stop (Vladimir) Putin in Ukraine, he won’t stop there. “So it is a threat to all of us and Ireland will continue with support for Ukraine until victory.” His comments come as the Irish government debate on how to change their offering to the thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the war and arriving in Ireland. As of this month, 96,338 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Ireland since the start of the war in February 2022. The Government has said that as a further 30-50,000 are expected to arrive in the next year, it must change the current open-ended accommodation it is offering, and potentially reduce entitlements to social welfare supports. There were disagreements at Cabinet this week after it was proposed a three-month limit would be placed on the period the state would be obliged to provide accommodation to Ukrainians. Ireland’s Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has said any change to state provisions for Ukrainian refugees must be “sustainable”, while cautioning that no decision had yet been taken. The minister, who is attending the EU summit in Brussels in his capacity as president of the Eurogroup of Eurozone finance ministers, said cabinet would come to a decision soon. “This is an issue that’s already been discussed at many different levels within government, it’s been discussed a number of times in the Ukraine cabinet sub-committee, and we regularly discuss policy issues in relation to migration and our support for the people of Ukraine who are facing this terrible war and the discussion that happened in cabinet earlier in the week is just part of that deliberative process,” he said. “So I’d expect that it will conclude soon. “The Government has not made a decision on that. “This is a complex matter. “The Irish people, the Irish state have shown a remarkable ability to support nearly 100,000 people that have come to our country in the last two years. “We just need to consider how we can continue to do this in the future and do so in a way that is sustainable. “Government hasn’t made the decision on the matter. “We’re aware of the many consequences of any decision that we make. “And I’d expect that in the next few weeks the matter will be considered again,” he said.",Broadsheet,1

Oleksandra and Yaroslav were offered shelter from Russia's war under the Homes for Ukraine scheme in April 2022, leaving newborn Anna with her grandparents in Kyiv until they were settled in the UK with work and their own home. But after finally overcoming the hurdles of finding accommodation and setting up their own marketing business in the UK, the couple's submission in April for their daughter, now a toddler, to join them was refused by the Home Office, after rules for the schemes allowing Ukrainians to do so were tightened overnight in February. ""Now it seems like it's impossible to bring Anna,"" Oleksandra told The Independent. ""I was almost there - and I wasn't expecting [the legislation] to change. I'm very sad and frustrated, I don't know what to do and how to react. If I am not able to bring Anna, we will be forced to leave everything and go somewhere else. ""I spent a lot of time building up the business, finding proper accommodation, and when we came here we didn't have anything - our business in Ukraine was closed and we didn't have any money. So it's not a good situation."" Despite the Home Office insisting that the new rules do not prevent children from joining their parents, charities warn the changes have created ""unintended consequences"" and could leave hundreds - if not thousands- of Ukrainians separated from their loved ones. The ""deeply shocking"" failure ""betrays our commitment to Ukrainians"", warned Labour peer Alf Dubs, who himself arrived in the UK as a six-year-old fleeing the Nazis. ""We pay lip service to how much we want to help Ukraine and the Ukrainians, then in practice we don't do it,"" Lord Dubs told The Independent. ""The most fundamental thing is, parents should be allowed to have their children with them - absolutely fundamental- and I think the government should be ashamed of itself."" Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael said: ""I struggle to decide what is most offensive about this case - the cruelty or the incompetence. These are both the defining characteristics of this Conservative Home Office. The fact that they do not seem to understand their own rules tells you all you need to know."" While previously Ukrainian refugees could sponsor family members, now only British and Irish citizens or those with permanent leave to remain can do so. Announcing the changes on 19 February, the government said it had eschewed the typical implementation period of 21 days to avoid a ""misplaced surge of applications"". Approached about Anna's case by The Independent, the Home Office said: ""We absolutely do not prevent a parent being joined by a child in the UK. The Ukraine scheme rules have never prevented this, nor do the changes prevent this."" But despite their application for Anna stating that they are her parents, Oleksandra and Yaroslav received a refusal letter 11 days later, on 26 April, that said Anna was not eligible because - as per the new rules - her ""sponsor does not meet the requirement that they must be a British or Irish citizen or have no time limit on their stay in the UK"". ""I don't know how to react - it's very, very sad and depressing,"" said Oleksandra. ""I was crying when I saw [the letter] because I expected they would personally look at the situation and let Anna in because we are her parents."" Naqeeb Sadiq, a senior immigration adviser at the charity Settled, which helped with Anna's visa application, said he fears that the new legislation - which served to close the Ukraine Family scheme, and tighten the rules relating to both the Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Extension schemes - may have created ""unintended consequences"" and be keeping families apart. ""Earlier in the scheme, the government had to make amendments to the policy because of issues relating to minors - that was within six months of the scheme being announced,"" said Mr Sadiq. ""So it may be the case that they've just overlooked it again."" Warning that hundreds if not thousands of families could potentially be affected, Settled's Ukraine schemes adviser Yuliia Ismail said: ""Generally for Ukrainians, it's quite typical, sometimes, to leave children in Ukraine or somewhere else with relatives before coming to the UK to get settled, because it's so difficult for them to get private rented accommodation."" As more families find their feet in Britain, Ms Ismail warned that Settled is among several organisations now seeing a rising number of cases similar to Anna's. Oleksandra added: ""I'm not alone - I know for sure, I have friends here in a similar situation. Nobody expected this."" Urging the Home Office to grant young children visas in cases like this, the charity's chief executive Kate Smart said: ""This rule change, introduced with no warning, puts this family in a terrible position. Children in Ukraine's war zones belong with their parents, safe in the UK."" Agreeing that the new policy has left Ukrainian refugees with no way to bring their children, partners or family members to Britain, the Refugee Council also urged ministers to allow Ukrainians with temporary status in the UK to sponsor their close family members. ""Until they do, Ukrainians who have already suffered so much are being stopped from being with their loved ones and rebuilding their lives,"" he said. Insisting that their rules do not prevent children from joining their parents, a Home Office spokesperson added: ""We continue to provide a safe and secure haven for those fleeing the ongoing conflict, whilst providing certainty and assurance for Ukrainians in the UK on their future as the war continues.""

Hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme will get £500 a month after their first 12 months of sponsorship, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) said. Councils will also be given money to help prevent homelessness among arrivals and to acquire more homes for people fleeing conflict in places such as Ukraine and Afghanistan. But the sum local authorities receive for each Ukrainian refugee who arrives into their area under the scheme will be reduced “in light of wider pressures on the public finances”, DLUHC said. Some 107,100 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, with 144,600 visas issued, latest Government figures show. We have stood firm with Ukraine but we owe special thanks to the tens of thousands of families across the UK who opened their homes and their hearts to Ukrainians fleeing war. In recognition of their ongoing support, I’m pleased to confirm that they will see their ‘thank you’ payments uplifted for their second year of sponsorship Michael Gove DLUHC said the monthly thank you payments to hosts will be extended from 12 months to two years. The increase – from £350 a month for the first year to £500 a month thereafter – is less than former refugees minister Lord Richard Harrington had been calling for. Before stepping down in September, he said he had been lobbying for the payment to be doubled to £700 after six months. In cases where sponsorship arrangements cannot continue, councils across the UK will be given £150 million to help Ukrainians move into their own homes and reduce the risk of homelessness. It can also be used to prevent homelessness among other groups. A separate £500 million Local Authority Housing Fund will enable councils in England to acquire housing stock for those fleeing conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and Afghanistan. This is expected to provide up to 4,000 homes by 2024, DLUHC said, through buying housing stock, building new homes, converting non-residential properties, and refurbishing dilapidated or empty homes. Our work is not done yet. The crisis in Ukraine continues and I urge anyone who is able to to come forward and volunteer as a sponsor Housing and homelessness minister Felicity Buchan Amid the funding for housing, councils will receive a lower tariff payment for each Ukrainian refugee who arrives into their local area – £5,900 per person, down from £10,500. This money can be spent on safeguarding and accommodation checks, support to help refugees rebuild their lives and integrate, and education and skills support, such as English language courses. Secretary of State Michael Gove said: “We have stood firm with Ukraine but we owe special thanks to the tens of thousands of families across the UK who opened their homes and their hearts to Ukrainians fleeing war. “In recognition of their ongoing support, I’m pleased to confirm that they will see their ‘thank you’ payments uplifted for their second year of sponsorship.” Housing and homelessness minister Felicity Buchan said: “Hosting a Ukrainian family is a massive commitment and, from the amazing sponsors I’ve met, I also know that the rising cost of living is putting additional pressures on both household and local finances. “That is why we are increasing ‘thank you’ payments to keep this incredibly successful programme going. “But our work is not done yet. The crisis in Ukraine continues and I urge anyone who is able to to come forward and volunteer as a sponsor.” The promise of more financial support for hosts is welcomed, as most households I am in touch with are delighted to be hosting Ukrainian refugees but the cost-of-living crisis has added unforeseen financial pressure on them Dr Krish Kandiah, The Sanctuary Foundation The Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain said: “Ukrainians everywhere are grateful to the Government and the British people for opening their homes and hearts to Ukrainians fleeing their homes as a result of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. “We welcome today’s announcement, which recognises the commitment of sponsors during difficult economic times, and will provide additional support and reassurance to Ukrainian families as they rebuild their lives and seek to overcome the trauma of war.” Dr Krish Kandiah, a host and director of The Sanctuary Foundation, which helps refugees and sponsors, said: “The promise of more financial support for hosts is welcomed, as most households I am in touch with are delighted to be hosting Ukrainian refugees but the cost-of-living crisis has added unforeseen financial pressure on them. “The £500 million fund to invest in housing is a brilliant innovation that will help Ukrainians and Afghans fleeing conflict but also, importantly, local people at risk of homelessness.”",Broadsheet,1

Sir Keir was speaking at a launch of the Labour campaign for May local elections at the Greenwood Centre in north west London , when he reflected on the war between Russia and Ukraine and how the UK should help refugees. Belsize Park candidate in Camden, Peter Ptashko, told the crowd he has family members that are currently in the north western part of Ukraine, near Kyiv. He then requested for a minute's silence to be held for those still in Ukraine and others who are fleeing. Sir Keir, who is the MP for the nearby seat of Holborn and St Pancras, told the crowd: ""Peter, thank you for allowing us time to just stop and reflect on the position in Ukraine...it is a desperately depressing situation in Ukraine. ""I remember how I felt when the Berlin Wall came down, that sense of freedom, of something big changing in the world, of countries being free again to decide for themselves, how they decided their own futures, the alliances that they made with other countries, that sense that once that wall came down, nothing like that could happen again. ""I did not think that in my lifetime, I would ever see again Russian tanks going into a European country. ""Soldiers kissing their children goodbye as they stay to fight for their cities and for their country. ""And the desperation of families fleeing across the border, I didn't think I would see that again...this is going to change our politics for a very, very long time to come and that's why it's so important that we support the Ukrainians and everything that they are courageously trying to do."" He called again for the ""strongest possible sanctions"" to be put in place against Russia and to help the refugees. Referring to the Government's Homes for Ukraine scheme which was launched on Friday, he added: ""I have no problem with an ad hoc scheme that allows people to take refugees into their homes. ""Of course I don't, but we need much, much more than that."" Sir Keir said a ""serious supportive package"" is required, working with local councils and housing providers, to help give the Ukrainian refugees the ""full support they need"" as they arrive in the UK. The Government has imposed a range of sanctions against Russia since the outbreak of the war on February 24, including full asset freezes on Russian banks. An update to the Gov.uk website on Tuesday said that 350 new listings had been made under the Russia sanctions regime. The list of those sanctioned was expanded to include a further 51 Russian oligarchs and their families, plus a raft of politicians and ""propagandists"". The Homes for Ukraine scheme allows Britons to provide accommodation for someone fleeing the war zone. Announcing the scheme last week, Communities Secretary Michael Gove said ""in recognition of their generosity"" a tax-free monthly payment of £350 will be provided to people for each family they look after. He told MPs Ukrainians will be able to live and work in the UK for up to three years under the scheme, with ""full and unrestricted access to benefits, healthcare, employment and other support"". The scheme is open to Ukrainian nationals and immediate family members who were residents prior to January 1. A total of 150,000 people have expressed their interest in becoming a sponsor to house Ukrainian refugees so far, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. Friday also marked the launch of the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, which allows Ukrainian refugees without family members in the UK to apply for a visa. As of March 19, 9,500 visas have been issued under the Ukraine Family Scheme scheme out of a total of 30,300 submitted applications, according to the Government's website. A Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office spokesperson said: ""We have introduced the largest and most severe package of sanctions ever imposed on Russia or indeed any major economy. The UK has designated over 1,000 individuals and entities under the Russia sanctions regime since the invasion. ""We have cut off Russian banks with assets of £258 billion as well as the central bank in Moscow. Over three million Russian companies are now barred from raising money on UK capital markets.""",Broadsheet,1

Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that setting up temporary police checks on border crossings would help Germany prevent the smuggling and trafficking of people. She added that the increased border checks would need to be combined with the already ongoing random police checks that are being carried out. Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic belong to the European Union's visa-free zone, commonly known as the Schengen Area. “Respective additional border police measures are currently being reviewed,” a German Interior Ministry spokesperson told the German news agency dpa. Faeser is also discussing with the Czech Republic the possibility of German police officers operating on Czech territory, similar to an agreement that Germany has struck with Switzerland.  “In close coordination with Swiss police forces, German police officers are allowed to inspect on Swiss territory and to prevent unauthorized entry (into Germany),"" the minister said. Faeser also demanded closer cooperation on migration between the EU and Turkey, and said that the current EU-Turkey deal required an “update.” The number of people who migrated to Germany in 2022 was higher than in any other year, according to the German federal statistics agency Destatis, with about 2.67 million people having entered the country in 2022. Included in the number are 1.1 million Ukrainian refugees who sought safety in Germany after Russian launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",Broadsheet,1

The Prime Minister said it was important that ""checks both ways"" were being carried out before Ukrainian refugees could come to the UK, both to ensure those in need were who they said they were, and also that those offering help were fit to do so. Appearing in front of the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Johnson said there had already been cases of ""people coming from that war zone who may not be entirely who they say they are"" after it was revealed just 2,700 visas have been granted to people wanting to come to the UK under the Homes For Ukraine scheme despite applications reaching 28,300. The UN refugee agency said four million people have now fled Ukraine since Russia launched its war on February 24. Meanwhile, a charity which has helped about 70 Ukrainian refugees apply for UK visas said none have been approved in the 13 days since the sponsorship scheme opened. Volunteers for Love Bristol, which is operating in Poland, said so far everyone they have helped is still waiting for permission to come to the UK. The PM said he was not going to berate civil servants and officials and ""blame people for being slow"" as he said they have to ""balance some quite difficult objectives"". Mr Johnson said: ""What I wanted was a system that was as light touch as possible and would enable people to come here, but would enable us also to do checks. ""We are outside the Schengen system, we have the advantage of being able to clarify people's status, (that) they're bona fide - that's not a bad thing if you want to have a programme that really works and commands confidence."" Dame Diana Johnson , the Labour chair of the Home Affairs Committee, told Mr Johnson that some anti-slavery and refugee groups had warned that the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship ""risked operating as Tinder for sex traffickers"". He said: ""I think that is one of the reasons why it is important to have as light touch as possible, but to have DBS checks and checks both ways to make sure we have a programme that is really working."" Defending the rate of progress in resettling refugees, the Prime Minister added: ""These numbers are climbing. ""There is no cap on the family reunion scheme, that's already at the thick end of 25,000. That's a pretty big town."" Mr Johnson said he did not yet know how many of the 2,700 people who have been given visas for the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme had arrived in the UK. He said although many Ukrainians wanted to stay in the region of their country and ""in an ideal world"" would want to go home, he said ""a lot of them increasingly are now wanting to come to other European countries, they're wanting to come to the UK, and that's quite right"". Earlier, refugees minister, Lord Harrington, said progress is starting to be seen thanks to changes the Home Office has made to ""streamline"" the visa process. But shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, accused the Government of ""wasting the amazing generosity that British people have shown"". The Prime Minister said that while the UK was ""certainly looking at going up a gear in our support for the Ukrainians as they defend themselves"", he was not echoing the call of Us President Joe Biden for Vladimir Putin to be removed from office. Mr Johnson told MPs that ""to desire a change of government in itself is not an ignoble thing"" as he joked that some MPs on the Liaison Committee would ""like a change in this Government"". But he said: ""It's not the objective of the UK Government and it's very, very important everybody gets this, we are simply setting out to help to protect the people of Ukraine and to protect them against absolutely barbaric and unreasonable violence."" Further sanctions against Russia are expected to be announced shortly, and the PM said: ""In my view, we should continue to intensify sanctions with a rolling programme until every single one of (Vladimir Putin's) troops is out of Ukraine."" He said simply agreeing to a ceasefire would not be enough for measures to be lifted, adding that ""goes straight into Putin's playbook"".

It was built by a 19-year-old Harvard student,"A Harvard University student is matching Ukrainian refugees fleeing their homes in the war-torn nation with people offering spare rooms or a couch to sleep on in their homes all around the world. Avi Schiffmann, a 19-year-old neurophilosophy student, spoke to the The Independent last month about how he and his classmate Marco Burnstein, 18, launched the website Ukraine Take Shelter to help the more than two million Ukrainians who have so far escaped from Russia 's attack as they desperately try to find temporary places to stay. ""I realised that the tools out there to help refugees find places to stay were really sub-par,"" he said. ""Many of these refugees are escaping on foot amid explosions and shelling. They are stressed and confused and scared and they are in new countries where they don't understand the language. ""And then they are just expected to go onto a government website that is full of jargon and nonsense and wait to be matched with somewhere to stay."" Follow live updates on Ukraine In the five weeks since Russia declared war, people from countries across the world have rallied in support of the Ukrainian people, donating items and sending funds. Many have offered to take refugees into their homes but accounts on social media have revealed frustrations with their abilities to turn these offers into realities. In the month Ukraine Take Shelter launched, thousands of people from ""almost every country on the planet"" have now posted listings offering entire homes, annexes, rooms and even couches in their houses for Ukrainian refugees to stay. As of 11 March, a week after the site launched, there were 5,000 active listings on the website -not including an estimated 300 that hosts have taken down after their spaces have been filled, Mr Schiffmann said. ""For example, there were dozens of places in Hungary last night but by this morning there was almost none left,"" he said. Less than a month later, more than 18,000 hosts had signed up to the site which had approximately 800,000 users, Mr Schiffmann and Mr Burnstein told the Associated Press in an article published on 5 April. Many of the listings are in European countries close to Ukraine but offers have also come from hosts as far away as Israel, Canada and the US -as some refugees try to travel to countries where they have close ties. ""People are offering everything from a couch in their apartment for one person to an entire farm that can fit five families,"" Mr Schiffmann told The Independent last month. ""If you have an extra couch in your home in a small village in Hungary, you can hop on the website and post a listing and then refugees can contact you."" A quick search on the website revealed the likes of a long-term listing offering a three-bedroom home in downtown Ottawa for a family with children and a room for two people in Poland. For people who don't have space to take in fleeing refugees, Mr Schiffmann said there are other offers flooding in such as help with transportation or offers to take in refugees' pets. One listing from a host in Kraków, Poland, said they were willing to pay for an Airbnb for a refugee. Meanwhile, a host in Prague was offering temporary foster care for up to two cats including vet bills and pet food costs. ""It's kind of a Craigslist for refugees,"" said Mr Schiffmann. ""The thing about the site is that it puts the power back into the hands of refugees -they can see the listings and pick from them rather than waiting around to be matched by a nonprofit or a government. ""They already feel powerless -now they can use their own initiative and go to the site and find a listing for themselves."" Since its launch, Mr Schiffmann said he has heard from both refugees and hosts who have connected through the website. One heartwrenching message he shared with The Independent read: ""Once again thank you for making that website, if it weren't for your website. He was losing hope to return alive."" He said: ""A lot of people don't want to leave Ukraine if they don't know that they can get stable housing over the border. ""People are afraid for their lives but they are also afraid what will happen if they don't have any plans in place."" The teenager said that he came up with the idea a few days into the war when he began thinking of ways he could help Ukrainians from where he lives in the US. He said he attended a protest against Russia's attack with a friend in San Diego and felt like it ""wasn't really helping"". ""I went with a friend to a protest in solidarity with Ukraine in Balboa Park where people were holding up signs reading 'Stop Putin' and Ukrainian flags,"" he said. ""And I thought that's great for the few hundred people there in San Diego but I thought 'it's not really doing anything'. ""It's just a bit of a show really that looks great on Instagram but isn't really helping the people in Ukraine."" The teenager decided that there had to be something more practical that he could do to help. That night -28 February -he started researching and noticed that there was a challenge that could easily be solved. He sent a tweet to his 54,000 followers: ""A cool idea would be to set up a website to match Ukrainian refugees to hosts in neighboring countries."" He got into bed and noticed his tweet gaining more and more traction. ""I thought 'yeh okay, I'm the perfect person to do it'. And so I jumped out of bed and got started,"" he said. He contacted his friend and Harvard University computer sciences student Mr Burstein and they spent the next three days working around the clock until the website went live. ""We didn't sleep for three days, we just got it up as fast as possible,"" he said. The 19-year-old already had a large public platform after he hit headlines for launching a website during the pandemic that tracked Covid-19 cases. So he sought the help of this online community for expertise in the likes of cyber security and language translation. ""Anything I needed help with such as translations into Romanian I would tweet out and within moments, people reached out to help,"" he said. The result is a user-friendly website that is entirely created by volunteers and is currently accessible in 12 different languages including Ukrainian, Russian and Polish. People with space to welcome a refugee into their home can simply post a listing on the website. A refugee then uses the simple search function to search for shelter in a specific area and the website shows them all the places nearby and what the hosts are offering. The refugee can then contact a host directly through the contact details listed. Amid concerns for the safety of Ukrainian refugees as well as for hosts who are taking a stand against Russian aggression, it was important to make the website as secure as possible. Neither the host nor the refugee share their exact locations on the site and refugees don't even need to make an account. Email addresses are not shared on the website as people often use their first name and last name so can be more easily identified, Mr Schiffmann explained. The student said that he was surprised that Western governments hadn't already set up something like his website for the millions fleeing from Ukraine. ""Lots of governments are trying to do what they can but -like with the Covid website -I don't understand how a 19-year-old with no design experience can be faster and create a more accessible website than the government of the most powerful country in the whole world,"" he said. ""And not just governments but also NGOs and nonprofits."" Mr Schiffmann said the site is now also being used by humanitarian aid groups on the ground with Ukrainian refugees and he is now working closely with some groups around improving the site further.

2288,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,10/4/2022,1248 words,Via AP news wire,Poland-Ukraine ties seen as target of Russian disinformation," Days before Poland's Independence Day in November, vandals painted the blue-and-yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag on monuments in Krakow. The vandalism, which took place as Russia massed troops near Ukraine's border, looked as if Ukrainians were defacing memorials to Polish national heroes.  Yet some clues suggested otherwise. The flag's colors were reversed, with the yellow on top of the blue and one offensive message was in an unnatural mix of Russian and Ukrainian. Though prosecutors are still investigating, Polish and Ukrainian authorities believe it was most likely a Russian-inspired attempt to trigger ethnic hostility between Ukrainians and Poles. Polish and Ukrainian authorities have for years accused Russia of trying to provoke hostility between their neighboring nations as part of a broader effort to divide and destabilize the West - and the concerns have gained greater urgency since Russia invaded Ukraine.  Poland and Ukraine are neighbors and allies but they share a difficult history of oppression and bloodshed, and those historical traumas sometimes rise to the surface. Poland has also accepted large numbers of Ukrainian refugees, creating fears that could become another wedge issue that Russia could exploit. ""The Russian efforts to sow divisions between the Poles and Ukrainians, particularly by means of exploiting historical issues, are as old as time,"" said Stanislaw Zaryn, the spokesman for Poland's security services. ""Russia has redoubled them since the war began,"" he said. ""And they are more dangerous now because the war is going on and it can affect more people than before."" Reacting to the November incident, the Ukrainian Embassy in Warsaw immediately denounced it as ""shameful"" and ""a provocation aimed at harming the good neighborly relations between Ukraine and Poland."" More than 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Poland since the war began, and while some move on to other countries more than half have remained. Poles have reacted with an outpouring of help and goodwill and the government has extended to the Ukrainians the same rights to education and health care that Poles have. Never Again, an anti-racism association in Poland, has documented several attempts to stoke aversion to the Ukrainian refugees and even to openly justify Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion. In some cases those behind the messages are far-right Polish activists or politicians with pro-Kremlin views, according to a report the organization published Thursday. ""These groups do not enjoy widespread public support, but they do their best to make Poles and Ukrainians quarrel, spread hateful content, conspiracy theories and false information, primarily in the internet space,"" it said. Larysa Lacko, an expert on countering disinformation at NATO, said Russia is known to exploit refugees as a wedge issue because it touches on the economy, race and other sensitive issues, and that she has also observed Russian ""disinformation talking about historical grievances."" Western Ukraine was once under Polish rule, with Ukrainians largely subservient to a Polish landowning class. Resentments erupted in ethnic bloodshed during World War II, when the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a nationalist military formation, slaughtered tens of thousands of Poles in the Nazi-occupied Polish regions of Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. Poland also has a difficult history with Moscow. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carved up Poland at the start of World War II in 1939, invading and occupying the country based on a secret clause in the notorious Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Poles suffered atrocities inflicted by both occupying states. The Nazis set up death camps and concentration camps where they murdered Jews and they killed many other Polish citizens as well. Meanwhile, the Soviets sent some Poles to Siberia and murdered 22,000 Polish officers in the Katyn massacres of 1940. Even after the war, Poland was forced to live under Moscow's oppressive control for the decades of the Cold War. It still stings Poles to remember the Soviet Union denied the truth of the Katyn killings for decades, forbidding Poles from publicly commemorating the victims. When the Polish wartime government-in-exile asked the International Red Cross to investigate the Nazi disclosures of the Soviet crimes, Moscow smeared the Polish leaders as ""Fascist collaborators"" - much as they have falsely accused Ukraine today of being a Nazi state. Some Poles, especially those who lived through the war, remember those times and carry a lingering hostility to both Russians and Ukrainians.  One false claim Polish authorities say Russians are spreading is that Poland seeks to reclaim Lviv and other territory in western Ukraine that once was Polish. ""Those claims are untrue,"" the Polish Foreign Ministry said in a series of tweets seeking to debunk false claims. ""Poland will never accept the annexation of any territory belonging to an independent state."" Another is that Poland, a NATO ally hosting thousands of U.S. troops, is working to set the West against Russia. That claim was made recently by former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, the current deputy chairman of the Russian security council. ""Now the interests of the citizens of Poland have been sacrificed due to the Russophobia of mediocre politicians and their puppeteers from across the ocean with clear signs of senile insanity,"" Medvedev wrote recently on Telegram, a social media app popular in Russia and Ukraine. Zaryn, the Polish security services spokesman, also pointed to a Polish Facebook page called ""A Ukrainian is NOT my brother,"" whose posts call on followers not to forget the Ukrainian massacres of Poles in the 1940s. The page was created less than a month after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has nearly 55,000 followers. In recent weeks posts have criticized Polish authorities for their strong support for Ukraine. Zaryn said evidence points to it being run by a woman with ties to a pro-Kremlin party, Zmiana, in Poland. The former leader of the party, Mateusz Piskorski, has worked for Russian news outlets RT and Sputnik and has been charged with espionage for Russia and China.  Poland's government has been taking steps to protect itself, with public warnings about the disinformation attempts and expulsions of dozens of suspected Russian agents and one arrest. Days after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Polish authorities arrested a man they accused of being an agent of the Russian military intelligence agency, GRU, in Przemysl, a key entry points for Ukrainian refugees, as he sought to cross into Ukraine. In late March, Poland ordered the expulsion of 45 suspected Russian intelligence officers they accused of using diplomatic status as a cover to operate in the country.  ""The illegal activities of these diplomats can also pose a threat to those people who left their country to flee the war and found protection in our country,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lukasz Jasina said.  At a moment of huge solidarity in Poland and elsewhere with Ukrainians, disinformation is limited in its impact, argued Lacko, the NATO expert working to counter disinformation.  ""Given the atrocities on the ground, it's harder to fall into these sorts of traps,"" she said. But officials in Poland say they have to remain on guard, especially if the number of refugees grows, creating the potential for more social anxieties that can be exploited. ___ Frank Jordans in Berlin contributed.",Broadsheet,0

Prince Charles ' words come as thousands of Ukrainians continue to seek sanctuary from fighting in their homeland, following in the footsteps of millions of refugees who have already fled the Russian invasion. He said meeting the ""innocent victims of conflict"" over the years, he had found it ""profoundly moving"" to see the numbers of people ready to invite those in need into their homes. It comes after more than 200,000 people in the UK registered an interest in opening their homes to Ukrainian refugees under the government's Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. Charles also said it was an ""enormous privilege"" to perform the ancient ceremony of distributing Maundy money to community stalwarts at Thursday's Royal Maundy service, on behalf of the Queen who was unable to attend. The prince remembered the role that his late father, the Duke of Edinburgh, played during the many Maundy services he attended, when he would ""read the Gospel, which tells how on the night of the Last Supper, Jesus knelt before his disciples and washed their travel-weary feet"". Charles said in his message: ""Today, millions of people find themselves displaced, wearied by their journey from troubled places, wounded by the past, fearful of the future - and in need of a welcome, of rest and of kindness. ""Over the past years, I have found myself heartbroken at the sufferings of the innocent victims of conflict, or persecution, some of whom I have met and who have told me stories of unutterable tragedy as they have been forced to flee their country and seek shelter far from home. ""But amidst all this sadness and inhumanity, it has been profoundly moving to see how so many people are ready to open their homes to those in need, and how they have offered their time and their resources to help those facing such soul-destroying sorrow and hardship.""

Earlier this month, home secretary Priti Patel apologised for the low number of Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK, adding that it ""takes time to start up a new route"". Charles and wife Camilla showed their solidarity with Ukraine by lighting a candle for the nation and sympathising with its London community in March, during a visit to the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in central London. The future king concluded his message by saying: ""This Easter, as always, we are reminded of Our Lord's timeless example of goodness in the face of suffering, of courage in the face of fear, of faith in the face of despair.

Speaking in the Commons on Thursday the Home Secretary told MPs that visa restrictions imposed by the Home Office were necessary because of ""something known as the Windrush scandal"". The scandal came about because the government's ""hostile environment"" policies required people to show documentation they were never issued with when they arrived in the UK. As a result thousands of people - particularly those from the so-called ""Windrush generation"" who came to Britain after WWII were locked out of services like housing and healthcare. The government was pushed into paying compensation to the victims, who were mostly black Britons - though it has been criticised for being slow to do so. ""What we are seeing, and it is important that we're flexible in our response and we have been, is that there are many Ukrainians that do not have documentation,"" Ms Patel said in response to an urgent question from shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. ""And if I may, Mr Speaker, I think this country and all governments, including probably a government that she once served in, will recognise that there was something known as the Windrush scandal."" As MPs on the opposition benches cried out in anger over her comments, the Home Secretary continued: ""It's important that everyone who arrives in the UK has physical and digital records of their status in the UK to ensure that they're accessible to schemes. ""They may holler on the other side by the process is absolutely vital in terms of the verification - notification and permission to travel, but importantly to give people the status when they come to the United Kingdom to have that right to work, the right to access some benefits and also the digital verification of their status. I think that is absolutely right."" Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, who campaigned for the scandal's victims, appeared to criticise the Home Secretary's comments. Responding later on social media , he said: ""Priti Patel, please listen to your government's own Windrush Lessons Learned Review which said: ""the Home Office must ... change its culture to recognise that migration and wider Home Office policy is about people and, whatever it's objective, should be rooted in humanity."" Britain has stood out among European countries in not offering an open door policy to Ukrainian refugees - with the government coming in for international criticism. At the start of the week French interior minister Gerald Darmanin, wrote a strongly-worded letter to his British counterpart Priti Patel, accusing the UK of a ""lack of humanity"" for not opening its doors. Ms Patel announced more measures to relax biometric checks on Thursday but Labour has said the measures will still result in delays. The opposition says emergency protection visas should be introduced, though it has also stopped short of calling the UK to emulate the UK's open door policy and waive visas entirely.",Broadsheet,1

Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews , wrote to Priti Patel asking her to ""substantially increase capacity"" to provide UK visas to Ukrainian refugees who are ""stranded and vulnerable to lack of shelter and malnutrition as well as the dangers of war"". She Highlighted the case of Kateryna Razumenko, who reportedly fled her home and is now in Poland while trying to reunite with family in the UK. Ms van der Zysaid: ""This is a fast-moving situation and I am sure that both the Government and civil servants are working around the clock to ensure that the United Kingdom plays its role in accepting and supporting refugees. The current process appears to be far too slow Marie van der Zyl ""Nevertheless, there are inevitable delays in the process, leading to refugees being stranded and vulnerable to lack of shelter and malnutrition as well as the dangers of war. ""We strongly welcome the Government's family sponsorship programme, the intention to establish a humanitarian sponsorship pathway and your leadership in this matter. ""Unfortunately, the current process appears to be far too slow. ""The Jewish community has been moved in particular by a case of a 90-year-old Holocaust and Holodomor survivor, who is currently living in makeshift accommodation in Poland, but whose granddaughter in London is desperately trying to bring her over to ensure that she has the care and support she needs. ""For that one story we know about, there are likely to be thousands of refugees, of all faiths and none, facing similar circumstances. ""I am therefore asking for you to substantially increase capacity for delivering the family sponsorship programme and establish the humanitarian sponsorship pathway for which all Ukrainian refugees are eligible as quickly as possible."" Accord to the Telegraph, Ms Razumenko was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, in 1931 and has left her home country for the first time amid the conflict. Now in Poland, she is waiting to be processed by the UK Government so she can come to London to be with her granddaughter. It is understood the Home Office has escalated Ms Razumenko's case and is in contact with the family to get her to the UK as quickly as possible. A visa is expected to be provided within 24 hours. A Government spokesman said: ""Last week we announced a new sponsorship route which will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored to come to the UK. ""This is alongside our Ukraine Family Scheme, which has already seen thousands of people apply, as well as changes to visas so that people can stay in the UK safely. ""We are protecting appointments for Ukrainians at all our visa application centres, with a 24/7 helpline in place and deployed additional staff across the EU to help speed up the process further. ""The routes we have put in place follow extensive engagement with Ukrainian partners. This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops we will continue to keep our support under constant review.""",Broadsheet,1
2321,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,30/3/2022,928 words,SOFIA BARBARANI IN ROME,Trafficking warning as tens of thousands of Ukrainian child refugees arrive in Italy,"Italian aid agencies are warning people against taking in Ukrainian minors through unofficial channels due to concerns over exploitation and human trafficking, following the arrival in Italy of tens of thousands of children fleeing Russia's invasion. Roughly 72,000 Ukrainian refugees have reached Italy since Russia's ground and air offensive on its neighbour started over a month ago, catapulting Ukraine into a state of war and forcing nearly four million people to leave the country. More than 31,000 of these recent arrivals into Italy are children, many of them armed with little more than a backpack and a favourite toy. Approximately 300 of them are unaccompanied, according to the Italian interior ministry. Ukrainian children travelling solo are particularly vulnerable along their journeys, and even after crossing the border into the relative safety of Italy, they remain at risk of exploitation, violence and trafficking, NGOs have warned. ""We need the highest level of alert,"" said Raffaela Milano, head of Save the Children in Italy. ""During conflict there's the risk of being separated from the family and losing contact, and there are people who exploit [the situation]."" The influx of refugees has given rise to private individuals and unaccredited organisations purportedly seeking to help the arrivals. One such group was recently reported to local authorities, Ms Milano told The Independent. So far there are no known cases in Italy of human trafficking among Ukrainian arrivals, but charities are remaining vigilant. ""Given what happens in other conflicts, we need to keep our guard up,"" said Ms Milano. ""We invite people not to curb their generosity and hospitality but to direct them towards formal, institutional channels."" Such concerns are not unique to Italy. In the UK, Ukrainian refugees have started to ""advertise"" themselves on social media in a bid to find hosts while experts have warned that the British government's Homes for Ukraine scheme risks operating as ""Tinder for sex traffickers"". Aid agencies in Italy are moving as quickly as they can to avoid children falling through the cracks by registering them the moment they cross the border, before offering them psychological support and cultural mediators. But operating amid what the UN has called ""the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II"" is no easy feat for NGOs in Italy or in nations neighbouring Ukraine. Cases of children going missing along Ukraine's borders have already been reported by aid groups and volunteers in countries including Poland and Slovakia. Charities say they have seen men who they suspect to be predators, pimps or sex traffickers dressed in military fatigues or high-vis jackets and hanging around refugee shelters or transit points. Earlier this month, UN secretary-general António Guterres sounded the alarm about the threat of trafficking following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""For predators and human traffickers, the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy,"" he said on Twitter. ""It's an opportunity - and women & children are the targets."" In Italy, Unicef spokesperson Andrea Iacomini said there had been a ""proliferation of associations asking people if they want to take a Ukrainian child"". Most of the minors who have arrived in Italy without their respective parents have been entrusted to extended family members or family friends, according to Mr Iacomini. But reuniting them with their parents is key in avoiding further psychological stress and separation anxiety, he added. Parents have resorted to desperate measures to protect their children including sending them abroad with neighbours or friends while they remain in Ukraine to help with the war effort. ""This crisis is a crisis of separated minors, children who must be brought to their parents when the time comes - but right now they must be protected,"" Mr Iacomini told The Independent. ""Many of these children bear the so-called scars of war, they're in need of protection and should be protected immediately."" Last week in the Italian senate, interior minister Luciana Lamorgese called for an increase in border controls ""to avoid grey areas that favour criminal interests and trafficking. All minors who cross the border are identified and have been guaranteed access to school activities"". After they are registered by aid workers at the border, Ukrainian refugees are free to travel onwards and with roughly 240,000 Ukrainian residents in Italy, many new arrivals have found housing with friends and family. Those without acquaintances in Italy are offered accommodation in the homes of local families, as well as monasteries, hotels and prefabricated buildings once used for those displaced by the 2016 earthquake. Italians who wish to help have been asked to register with their local governments and aid groups. In larger cities such as Milan, the Ukrainian consulate is also helping to keep a list of incoming people and families wishing to house them. The number of Ukrainian arrivals has dwindled over the past week, Ms Lamorgese added. But if ""Odessa or Lviv were to be touched, the influx would begin again in a colossal way,"" she said According to Save the Children, about 6 million children are still in Ukraine and under threat due to the ongoing attacks on civilian areas. At least 464 schools and 43 hospitals have been targeted so far, the charity said last week. The UN on Sunday said 1,119 civilians had been killed since the start of the war on 24 February - 99 of them children - while warning that the true figures were likely to be much higher.",Broadsheet,1

But it is unclear whether this referred to a sponsorship scheme that has already been announced, with Europe minister James Cleverly saying on Monday that there had been no change to the plans over the weekend. Speaking to Sky News on Monday morning, Mr Cleverly said the Government has made it ""absolutely clear"" it wants to support Ukrainians seeking refuge. He acknowledged that ""only small numbers have come so far"" but ""the process has only just started"". Mr Cleverly also told LBC that the number of Ukrainians being granted visas for the UK will increase ""very, very quickly"" but the scale of the crisis is ""unprecedented"". ""This is the largest refugee flow that we have seen since the Second World War,"" he said. The Home Office ""had to create a system pretty much from scratch"", he said, and the process ""will get quicker and slicker and faster"". ""It will take a little time to get the system up and running, that's now there, I have no doubt that the numbers will start coming through,"" he said. Ms Patel said over the weekend that the UK is ""doing everything possible"" to speed up efforts to grant visas to Ukrainian refugees, and told the Sun she is examining a ""humanitarian route"" to allow all those fleeing the conflict to come to the UK. But it is unclear whether this ""humanitarian route"" is actually a new concept, or refers to a sponsorship scheme already announced - whereby individuals and organisations will be able to bring Ukrainians to the UK. Ms Patel told the newspaper: ""In response to the desperation I saw with my own eyes at the Polish border two days ago, I'm urgently escalating our response to the growing humanitarian crisis. ""I am now investigating the legal options to create a humanitarian route. ""This means anyone without ties to the UK fleeing the conflict in Ukraine will have a right to come to this nation."" Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast on Monday: ""We've got two routes by which Ukrainians can come to the UK. ""One is where they have family connections, but we also have a broader humanitarian route for Ukrainians who do not have family who are already here in the UK - there is no particular target or limit on that route."" Asked whether there had been a change to the plans over the weekend, he said: ""No, no, no. This is what's been in place previously.""",Broadsheet,1

Ben Wallace said on Monday that the move to allow immediate family members to join Ukrainians settled in the UK is only a ""first step"" as Vladimir Putin's assault continued. Mr Wallace dismissed the Russian president putting his nuclear forces on heightened alert as being a part of the Kremlin's ""battle of rhetoric"" rather than a real threat. With Western sanctions biting, the Russian central bank was forced to sharply raise its key interest rate to save the rouble from collapse as the war worsened the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. The UK Government announced the relaxation of visa rules for immediate family members of Ukrainians settled in the UK after coming under intense criticism over the weekend. But Labour called for ministers to immediately extend the opportunity to wider relatives before setting out a ""broader sanctuary route"" to help other Ukrainians. Mr Wallace said he does not doubt the UK will go further to match the ""very generous"" schemes that have helped in other conflicts. ""I think what I would say is, you know, our track record so far, both with Afghans and (the) Arap (Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy) scheme, and indeed with the Hong Kong nationals who were suffering persecution, has been actually very generous,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""So there's no reason to doubt we won't continue on that path."" He said it is not yet clear whether the European Union's approach will be to support refugees on the border, with the hope they will be able to return to Ukraine soon. But he added that the UK response will be discussed by senior ministers on Monday. Home Secretary Priti Patel is understood to be preparing to address further measures to support refugees when she takes questions in the Commons on Monday afternoon. Tom Tugendhat , the senior Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, also anticipated further measures for refugees as being ""likely"". ""I've been speaking to ministers this morning and I can tell you there are many who are hopeful that this will be something that's reviewed in the coming days,"" he told Today. Asked about the EU scheme to grant asylum to Ukrainian refugees for up to three years, Mr Tugendhat said: ""I suspect that's likely to be where we end up, to be honest."" Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said it is ""shameful"" for the Government to ""refuse to even help other relatives in a terrible European war like this"". Mr Putin cited ""aggressive statements"" from the Nato defence alliance and the financial sanctions imposed in response to his invasion in issuing orders to increase the readiness of Russia's nuclear weapons. The Treasury is targeting Russia's central bank with sanctions in a response co-ordinated with the US and European allies. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the move shows the ""steadfast resolve in imposing the highest costs on Russia and to cut her off from the international financial system so long as this conflict persists"". Mr Wallace said his 12-year-old son called him, worried about Moscow's nuclear alert, but the Cabinet minister played down the shift's significance as not being a change to the current ""nuclear posture"". ""We will not do anything to escalate in that area, we will not do anything to feed any miscalculation, we take it very, very seriously,"" he told Today. ""But at the moment this is a battle of rhetoric that President Putin is deploying, and we just have to make sure we manage it properly."" He warned that the Russian offensive in Ukraine is likely to become ""more violent"", as troops close in around the capital, Kyiv. Despite the continued assault, Ukraine has agreed to talks with Moscow and is sending a delegation to the border with Belarus for the meeting. A rare emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly will discuss the crisis in Ukraine on Monday.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said “wars seem everywhere at the moment” as he delivered his annual start-of-the-year address. Speaking from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, he said: “Wars seem everywhere at the moment. “Wars we know about, wars forgotten. “I’ve seen for myself the ongoing human cost of war. Jesus Christ tells us to stand with those suffering because of war, and to seek to make peace Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby “In Ukraine I went to Bucha where evidence of atrocities was found. “I’ve met Ukrainian refugees, most recently in Georgia and Romania: families having to start again in a new country. “I’ve met refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh (a territory disputed between Azerbaijan and Armenia) after they left their homes because of conflict. “And in Jerusalem last October I sat and listened to some of those traumatised by war, Palestinian and Israeli. “Jesus Christ tells us to stand with those suffering because of war, and to seek to make peace.” It came after Russia launched a fresh drone assault on Ukraine on Saturday night, hitting the capital, Kyiv, and border city Kharkiv after promising that strikes on the Russian border city of Belgorod hours earlier, which killed 24 people, would “not go unpunished”. The health ministry in Gaza said on Saturday that another 165 people were killed in the previous 24 hours. In his address, the archbishop also praised the armed forces as he said they embody the theme of the King’s coronation last year. He said soldiers were at the centre of the celebrations not “just because the world marvelled at their displays of pageantry” but because they, “like many, many others in the country”, embodied service. He added: “Here at RAF Brize Norton, almost 6,000 service personnel are living out that oath every day, working to keep us safe and the country secure, delivering humanitarian aid following natural disasters, like the earthquake in Turkey last year, or supporting civilians in the midst of conflict in places like the Middle East. “We’re learning more and more how the horrors and traumas of war impact service personnel, sometimes long after. “But there are also traumas for their loved ones. “Families across the country feel the absence of relatives and those they love who are serving their country abroad. “We fear for those of our fellow citizens who risk their lives defending and protecting the vulnerable and ensuring security.”  – The Archbishop of Canterbury’s New Year Message will be broadcast on BBC1 and iPlayer at 12.55pm on Monday January 1.

2395,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,10/2/2023,778 words,John Wawrow,Ukrainian boys team embracing respite from horrors back home," The travel, the diplomatic paperwork and out-of-pocket cost of $20,000 Sean Berube estimated spending crisscrossing Europe to gather a group of 21 Ukrainian refugees to form a hockey team of 11-and 12-year-old boys is a mere pittance compared to the payoff. The Quebec City businessman would do it all over again in a heartbeat based on the transformation in the children’s demeanor — from worrying to wowed — Berube has witnessed over the past two weeks. “When I met them first in Romania , I could see that some of them were reserved, quiet to themselves. Some of them, I didn’t see them smile,” Berube told The Associated Press on Friday. “And now, I mean they’re totally embracing the moment.” That moment will come Saturday, when the Ukrainian Selects make their debut facing the Boston Junior Bruins in the Class AA division of the International Peewee Tournament before what is expected to be a capacity crowd of 18,000 — the first sellout in the tournament’s 63-year history — at Quebec City’s Videotron Centre. Whatever the outcome, the boys have already won as far as Berube is concerned for the two-week respite they will have enjoyed from the daily horrors of the Russian invasion of Ukraine back home.  And that includes getting a good night’s sleep. “In Ukraine, usually there’s sirens at 4 in the morning, so they always have to wake up and rush to the most fortified area of their building,” Berube said, referring to what one player told him of experiencing near daily rocket warnings. “Now, he can sleep the whole night.” The game in the two-loss elimination tournament is the culmination of a process Berube and tournament organizers first launched in August, when the possibility of the team being assembled was first broached by Evgheniy Pysarenko.  A former tournament participant and friend of Berube, Pysarenko was inspired after watching many refugee children fleeing Ukraine and crossing into Romania with hockey equipment in tow. He started holding practices as a way to keep the boys occupied before realizing they were talented enough to compete.  The idea, coupled with the team’s arrival in Quebec City some 10 days ago, has resulted in an outpouring of support from across Canada , and generated international attention at a time the strife in Ukraine is intensifying a little less than a year since the war began. Fans attending the game have been asked to wear white as a statement of peace. A contingent of Quebec City’s small Ukrainian community will be on hand waving yellow and blue in cheering on a team considered to be a symbol of hope for their country’s future. Olga Grayvoronska Sharpe never cared much for hockey during the 11 years she has lived in Canada after leaving behind her family in Kharkiv, Ukraine. She's now eagerly excited to be attending her first game on Saturday. “I’m sure I won’t be able to hold my tears back out of joy for those young men,” she said. “It’s for the future, the future of life, that life no matter what — no matter (Russian President) Vladimir Putin’s plan — will prevail and young people would win.” What hit home for Grayvoronska Sharpe is the memory of crossing into Ukraine by foot last summer and seeing her bombed-out hometown devastated, while visiting her 82-year-old parents, who refused her pleas to leave Karkhiv by saying, “If we leave, who would stay?” She then turned her attention to Berube by saying, “this wouldn’t be possible without Sean. I view him as a hero.” Berube deflected the attention.  “I’m doing this because I want to give back to Ukraine and to those boys,” he said. “The heroes are their fathers who risk their lives.” One player’s father died in action. Another five have fathers fighting on the front line defending Ukraine. In the meantime, the remainder of their families are scattered around Europe.  Berube is impressed by how the players have handled the spotlight, while enjoying themselves during tours of the city, which included a shopping spree at a local sports equipment store. “They’re like rock stars,” he said. “They’re very mature for their age. I think probably what they went through, they have a big sense of duty for their country. And that’s how the coaches prepared them too, that they’re doing that for Ukraine and they want to prove to the world that Ukrainians are proud and can be great hockey players.” There’s little doubt Berube will grow emotional once the game begins on Saturday.  “I think it’s a message of unity,” Berube said. “Tomorrow is going to be a celebration of hockey and how hockey unites people. And it’s going to be an event for peace for Ukraine.” ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",Broadsheet,0

It's fantastic that over 100,000 people and organisations have recorded their interest in supporting Ukrainians fleeing the war through the Homes for Ukraine scheme.Thank you to everyone across the country who has stepped up to offer their help so far. #StandWithUkraine https://t.co/cZWCHyLoZT - Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) March 15, 2022 The scheme has attracted criticism from refugee charities, who have said the fact households need to have the name of a refugee in order to take part risks ""excluding vulnerable people seeking refuge"". However, Mr Cleverly defended the new proposals on BBC Radio 4's Today programme saying: ""There are charities, faith groups, who are already in contact with people in Ukraine, people that need help and support. ""So, actually, rather than introduce a potentially slow and bureaucratic process, where people have already got connections -and there are a huge number of people and organisations that have already got connections with Ukrainians -rather than replicate, duplicate and slow that down, we want to be as agile and as quick as possible. ""That's why we're saying that, you know, we've got organisations which are already in contact with Ukrainians. We've now set up this site so British people can register their willingness to help and support. ""And, actually, what we're looking to do is connect those both ends of that system together and do so in a way that's quick and efficient."" Asked whether he will be taking part in the scheme, he told LBC: ""I have genuinely considered this. I've discussed this with my wife. ""I don't know whether our personal circumstances will allow us to do this right at the moment. As you know, Nick, my wife, she's going through medical treatment at the moment, but it's absolutely something that I'm considering."" More than 3 million people have now fled Ukraine in the first three weeks of Russian president Vladimir Putin 's invasion. It comes amid a dire warning from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky that other European nations could be targeted by Russia as he urged them to help his country.

2454,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,30/3/2022,841 words,May Bulman,Fears over hosting scheme as Ukrainians arriving in UK already registering as homeless,"Dozens of refugees who have come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have registered as homeless within days of arriving - prompting concern that hosting placements are already breaking down. Figures released by the Local Government Association (LGA) reveal that at least 36 Ukrainian households who have come to Britain under the new sponsorship scheme have already presented as homeless to local councils. The scheme, launched on 18 March, is designed to enable members of the British public to host Ukrainian refugees who have fled Vladimir Putin' s invasion into their homes, for which they are paid £350 per month. More than 150,000 people have so far registered their interest in hosting. But the new data, revealed on Wednesday, indicates that in some cases placements are already breaking down, sparking concerns around the level of checks that are carried out before refugees move in with hosts. The government has said 28,300 applications have been submitted under the programme since it launched, of which 2,700 have so far been issued - but it has so far refused to say how many applicants have so far arrived. James Jamieson, chair of the LGA, told MPs in the levelling up, housing and communities committee on Wednesday that 36 Ukrainian households on the sponsorship programme had presented as homeless to councils.  The Independent is raising money for the people of Ukraine - if you would like to donate then please click here for our GoFundMe page.  According to the LGA survey results he was citing, a further 44 Ukrainian families who have arrived under the family scheme have approached local authority homelessness services, while 64 whose status is unknown have also done so. In total, 144 Ukrainian refugee households have presented as homeless since the start of the war across 57 councils. Fewer than two thirds of all councils responded to the survey, so the true figure is likely to be higher. Mr Jamieson told MPs councils were ""worried"" about this, and warned that central government was not providing local authorities with adequate information on hosting arrangements before refugees arrive in the UK. He said that while they were getting data ""reasonably timely"" once visas had been submitted, this data was ""missing details"" that would enable proper checks to be carried out to ensure the placement is suitable. ""If we knew where the sponsors were, we would have the opportunity to check the properties out before the families arrive and would meet the people offering accommodation,"" the LGA chair said. ""Any idea about the needs of new arrivals, particularly traumatisation, pregnancy, disability, will hopefully mean fewer breakdowns but also gives councils an opportunity before they arrive to prepare. ""At the moment my understanding is the checks are being done after the visa has been issued. There may be a situation where someone arrives and three days later it is decided it is not suitable accommodation."" Clive Betts, vice-president of the LGA, who was chairing the committee hearing, told The Independent afterwards: ""The whole idea of the sponsorship scheme is that it wouldn't put pressures on local housing, but obviously it looks as if it will now. ""So what's the answer? It seems to be that they haven't got one at present."" It comes after The Independent first revealed that newly arrived Ukrainian refugees were registering is homeless in the UK, leaving councils to ""pick up the pieces"" and arrange emergency housing for them with no additional funding from central government. Families who have fled the Russian invasion and been granted visas on the Ukraine family scheme, which allows Ukrainians to join UK-based relatives, have arrived without anywhere to stay because their relatives do not have space in their homes to house them. A government spokesperson said it was urgently looking at the cases raised by the LGA, adding: ""These schemes are designed to ensure people who are coming to the UK fleeing the Russian invasion are provided with accommodation by their family or sponsor. ""Through Homes for Ukraine the government is giving councils £10,500 per person to provide support, including in a minority of cases where someone is left without accommodation.""

Prime Minister Eduard Heger said on Wednesday that people will have access to stores, shopping malls, various public gatherings and services, including bars and restaurants, without any restrictions. They won't have to present any certificate that they have been vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 or tested negative for the coronavirus. Those restrictive measures should be lifted by the end of February. As the next step, the government also plans to ease the limits on the number of people attending various public events and gatherings and most other remaining restrictions a month later, Heger said. The government has still to announce the details of the plan. Heger made the announcement as daily new infections in his country remain at record high levels around 20,000 cases, a level largely unchanged since the beginning of February. On Tuesday, Slovakia registered 19,955 new cases for a total of almost 1.3 million in the nation of 5.5 million.  ""We have to learn how to live with COVID,"" Heger said. ""We have an efficient tool to protect ourselves, and that's the vaccine."" Only over 2.5 million Slovaks, or 50.3% of the population, have been fully vaccinated, well below the European Union average of 71%. Despite the relatively low vaccination rate, hospitals are treating fewer patients for COVID-19 than during the earlier wave fueled by the delta variant. Slovakia has registered 18,145 deaths linked to COVID-19. ___ Follow AP's pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic  Read More BC-Olympic Digest, ADVISORY Poland prepares to accept Ukrainian refugees in case of war Slalom winner Vlhova leaving Olympics early with ankle issue",Broadsheet,0

The Hungarian carrier, which is listed in London, said it expects an operating loss of around £158m to £175m in the final quarter of its financial year - slightly above earlier forecasts. It has been forced to suspend flights to and from Ukraine, Russia and Moldova since Vladimir Putin's invasion of its neighbouring state, but now expects to fly more than in 2019 before the pandemic struck. There was controversy earlier this month when it promised 100,000 free seats to Ukrainian refugees escaping through Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania, but charged them for checked luggage. Wizz Air has also fiercely resisted attempts by workers to unionise, rejecting calls from unions in Italy to agree a labour contract. One of Denmark's biggest pension funds sold its shares in the airline over what it said were human and labour rights abuses. Between April and June, Wizz expects to fly 30 per cent more available seat kilometres than it did in 2019, and 40 per cent more between July and September. Jozsef Varadi, the airline's chief executive, said the Covid-19 Omicron variant ""proved to be of benign nature, which helped to relax government travel restrictions across a majority of our network"". ""Distressingly, the war in Ukraine dented demand for air travel and destabilised commodity prices across the globe,"" he added. ""Despite these developments, we are starting to see recovery take shape."" The airline has also reduced its exposure to volatility in oil prices by hedging for a coverage of 36 per cent of planned fuel volume usage from April to August this year. The carrier has opened a fourth UK base at Cardiff and is still expanding at its London Luton hub where it recently acquired another two additional daily slot pairs.

2506,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,17/4/2022,816 words,Steven Frank,"Voices: As a Holocaust survivor, Britain gave me a home - would today's government?","I will never forget the day I arrived in this country as a hungry, frightened nine-year-old. A British RAF pilot had spirited my family to Britain in the back of his fighter plane from Theresienstadt concentration camp, after it was liberated by Allied forces in May 1945. As we were waiting to be processed at an RAF reception centre, a kind old bobby took pity on my two brothers and me, teaching us our first words of English and slipping us each a sixpence and a smile. I remember it as the first time that a policeman in uniform had ever shown us anything but cruelty. This small act of kindness was just a taste of the wonderful welcome I would receive from the people of this country in the years to come. Since then, I have become a proud Brit, and raised wonderful children and grandchildren. But the generosity and values that I most admired are today being trampled on. If the government's new immigration proposals go ahead unchanged, a future version of me - from Ukraine, or fleeing repression elsewhere - is likely to be treated very differently. They will be denied protection, criminalised, and may even be sent to a detention centre in impoverished Rwanda. As a small boy, I witnessed the march of Nazi jackboots through the cobbled streets of my native Amsterdam. My father joined the Dutch resistance, and, as a respected Jewish lawyer, became involved with hiding Jews and providing false documents to allow them to escape Holland. One morning in 1942, he kissed us all goodbye and headed off to work. I never saw him again. My family and I were sent to a Nazi transit camp before being crammed into a cattle truck and sent on to Theresienstadt. I still remember the stench of faeces, urine, sweat and fear in that sweltering carriage, and the relief when the doors were thrown open, only to find ourselves in a place worse than we could have imagined. In the camp, we experienced the gnawing pain of hunger and witnessed human suffering on an indescribable scale. With the scenes on the television news in recent weeks, I cannot help but recall those terrible years. When I see the crowds of Ukrainian refugees, laden with what few possessions they can carry, I remember clinging to my mother as we waited to be deported, not knowing where we were going or what awaited us. When I hear about the barbarity of Russian soldiers towards civilians in Ukrainian towns and villages, I remember the unspeakable cruelty that seized Europe when I was a child in the 1940s. My heart is warmed by the kindness and compassion shown by people across the UK, where tens of thousands have offered their homes to Ukrainian families. This public generosity has not been matched by the UK government, with the clumsy bureaucratic obstacles that it puts in the way. But that is not the worst thing.  In its current form, the Nationality and Borders Bill means that refugees like me, who are forced to take irregular routes to safety in the UK, will in future face up to four years in prison. The bill, as both the UN and senior British judges have repeatedly pointed out, is in flagrant breach of the Refugee Convention, which Britain helped to shape.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here The 1951 Refugee Convention was adopted in the wake of the Holocaust to ensure that never again would those fleeing war, torture or persecution be denied protection for lacking the correct documents. A former Supreme Court justice has rightly dubbed the Nationality and Borders Bill a ""grotesque"" piece of legislation. The Lords have voted key provisions down, but Boris Johnson seems determined to pay no heed to their concerns. This government can and must do better, when the Lords amendments come back to the House of Commons on Wednesday. This bill is an affront to the long tradition of providing sanctuary to people in need that has made our country great. I know from my own experience that those who are given a chance will show only gratitude, as so many did when escaping from the Nazis. The generosity of spirit at that time showed that Britain was great. Tearing up our international commitments does the very opposite.

The statement comes a day after Russian authorities accused Ukrainian forces of launching airstrikes on residential buildings in one of the country's regions on the border with Ukraine , in which seven people sustained injuries.  According to Russian officials, some 100 residential buildings were damaged in Thursday's attack on the Klimovo village in the Bryansk region. The Defense Ministry said that the Russian forces in Ukraine's Chernihiv region shut down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter that was allegedly involved in the attack on the Bryansk region. Authorities in another border region, Belgorod, also reported Ukrainian shelling on Thursday. ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: - Russian military's damaged Black Sea flagship sinks - As Russia loses key ship, Zelenskyy praises nation's resolve - Russian legislator and 2 aides criminally charged in US - UN says Ukraine war threatens to devastate many poor nations - The AP Interview: UN food chief says Mariupol is starving - Go to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for more coverage ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: LONDON - Britain's defense ministry says the loss of Russia's naval flagship will likely force Moscow to change the way its naval forces operate in the Black Sea. The Moskva sank after being damaged in disputed circumstances. Ukraine says it struck the vessel with missiles, while Moscow acknowledged a fire on board but not any attack. In an update posted Friday on social media, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said the Soviet-era ship, which returned to operational service last year after a major refit, ""served a key role as both a command vessel and air defence node."" It said the sinking ""means Russia has now suffered damage to two key naval assets since invading Ukraine, the first being Russia's Alligator-class landing ship Saratov on 24 March. Both events will likely lead Russia to review its maritime posture in the Black Sea."" ___ KYIV, Ukraine - President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told Ukrainians on Thursday they should be proud of having survived 50 days under Russian attack when the Russians ""gave us a maximum of five."" In his late-night video address, Zelenskyy called it ""an achievement of millions of Ukrainians, of everyone who on Feb. 24 made the most important decision of their life - to fight."" Zelenskyy gave an extensive and almost poetic listing of the many ways in which Ukrainians have helped to fend off the Russian troops, including ""those who showed that Russian warships can sail away, even if it's to the bottom"" of the sea. It was his only reference to the Russian missile cruiser Moskva, which sank while being towed to port. Zelenskyy said he remembered the first day of the invasion when many world leaders, unsure whether Ukraine could survive, advised him to leave the country. ""But they didn't know how brave Ukrainians are, how much we value freedom and the possibility to live the way we want,"" Zelenskyy said.  ___ OTTAWA, Ontario - Canada is sending soldiers to Poland to help with the care, co-ordination and resettlement of Ukrainian refugees in Poland, including some who will come to Canada.  More than 2.6 million Ukrainians have fled into Poland since the first Russian troops crossed into Ukraine on Feb. 24 and over 2 million more have fled into other surrounding countries.  Defense Minister Anita Anand announced the deployment of up to 150 troops Thursday, saying the majority of the deployed troops will head to reception centers across Poland to help care for and register Ukrainian refugees.  Another group is being sent to help coordinate international aid efforts.  Canada has deployed hundreds of additional troops to eastern Europe since Russia's invasion as the NATO military alliance seeks to both support Ukraine and prevent the conflict from expanding into a broader war. ___ KYIV, Ukraine - The head of the U.N. World Food Program said people are being ""starved to death"" in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol and he predicted the country's humanitarian crisis is likely to worsen as Russia intensifies its assault in the coming weeks.  WFP executive director David Beasley also warned in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press in Kyiv that Russia's invasion of grain-exporting Ukraine risks destabilizing nations far from its shores and could trigger waves of migrants seeking better lives elsewhere. The war that began Feb. 24 was ""devastating the people in Ukraine,"" Beasley said, lamenting the lack of access faced by the WFP and other aid organizations in trying to reach those in need amid the conflict. The fluid nature of the conflict, which has seen fighting shift away from areas around the capital and toward eastern Ukraine, has made it especially difficult to reach hungry Ukrainians.  The WFP is trying to put food supplies now in areas that could be caught up in the fighting, but Beasley acknowledged that there are ""a lot of complexities"" as the situation rapidly evolves.

He sensed an opening, given Angela Merkel's departure and Emmanuel Macron's weakened authority after his naivety during his talks with Vladimir Putin before the invasion of Ukraine. This week, Johnson has hosted two London summits with fellow leaders in the anti-Putin coalition - the first with Canada and the Netherlands, the second with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. His campaign was boosted when Volodymyr Zelensky , Ukraine's remarkable president, told him ""we are very grateful to you, Boris"", in his moving speech to the Commons. Good pictures, and yet Johnson's pitch to be leading Europe is ridiculed in EU capitals. Diplomats note that UK ministers talk up the role of Nato and the G7 - but barely mention the EU's. ""The UK wants to give the impression it is leading in Europe but it is not,"" one said. ""The truth is that we miss the UK's strategic thinking on security. It could have been a key voice in the EU debate. But it is now irrelevant to it"". French officials tell me that if the UK were still an EU member, Paris would now be reaching agreement with London first before putting a proposal to Berlin because it trusts the UK's instincts and experience on security more than Germany's, despite Olaf Scholz's surprise and historic conversion to supplying arms to Ukraine. When we look back at Europe's biggest crisis since the Second World War, the German chancellor, rather than Johnson, might emerge as the continent's real leader. A better relationship with France before the war could still have given Johnson real influence, but needless post-Brexit tensions and silly point-scoring between Johnson and Macron left a cloud. So, there isn't close coordination between Britain and France over Ukraine. True, Johnson can grab a few headlines and praise for his statesmanship from Tory MPs (though he will welcome the good reviews he is now getting from them given his weak position at the start of the war). But to the EU, it's ""just spin"", as one official put it. I'm not talking about rejoining the EU. I'm an ex-Remainer but not a Remoaner. We are staying out. But that doesn't mean we can't forge a constructive relationship with those Johnson calls ""our EU friends and partners"". He should end his phobia about dealing with EU institutions which makes him rely on bilateral contacts with member states.  Talk of a new ""EU plus one"" alliance with the UK is premature. Liz Truss's invitation to attend a meeting of EU foreign ministers was not supported by all the EU's key players. Josep Borrell, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs, took the decision, despite the doubts of Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president and Charles Michel, president of the European Council.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here While EU figures welcome Truss's positive approach, they remain wary of Johnson. ""No one trusts him one bit,"" one diplomat told me. Johnson damaged ""Global Britain's"" image around the world by ripping up an international agreement he signed, the Northern Ireland protocol, and by cutting the overseas aid budget by £4bn. Ironically, the EU is now filling the aid gap in Africa, spreading its influence at the UK's expense: another triumph for the PM. Johnson's aspirations on the world stage have also been set back by the Home Office's chaotic, slow and grudging response to Ukrainian refugees.  It's time for Johnson to move on and into the new world in which the UK is rightly fighting a real war, rather than a juvenile war of words with its natural ally and biggest trading partner. If not now, when? It shames the country and is another terrible advert for Global Britain. The underlying cause is the same Brexit mentality preventing proper relations with EU institutions. ""We have a big heart in this country,"" Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, argued on BBC Radio 4 this morning. Yet the obsession with having ""control"" of our borders trumps the government's compassion. For once, the Brexiteers are out of tune with the public on immigration; six out of 10 people want to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees and only 15 per cent oppose the idea, according to Savanta ComRes.  Even the Tories' Brexit cheerleaders at The Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail and The Sun are appalled. Priti Patel's cabinet colleagues and many Tory backbenchers are worried she is trying to tweak the UK's bureaucratic system rather than acknowledge the obvious need to create a new one for this emergency. Johnson's lack of confidence in Patel is reflected in his decision to appoint a minister for refugees, Richard Harrington, outside the Home Office. ",Broadsheet,0

Martin Griffiths said “we would like to have seen more” in overseas aid spending from Britain, stressing that “money counts”. Rishi Sunak was criticised for slashing the foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income when he was chancellor in the wake of the hit to the economy from the Covid pandemic. It was meant to be a temporary reduction, but Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his autumn statement ruled out a return to the higher spending target for several more years. Mr Sunak has also overseen a redirection of overseas aid to programmes within the UK, with more now spent on housing refugees at home than on humanitarian assistance for poor developing countries. Asked if the UK was offering enough globally and paying what it had promised, Mr Griffiths told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: “Well, we were promised 0.7% of course. “That was brought down very quickly to 0.5%. And now it’s less than 0.5% if you think about it as an overseas aid budget.  The humanitarian response system is being tested to its limits.But I retain hope.

If we can’t put money on the table for places like Somalia, Afghanistan , the Central African Republic and so forth, well, all the analysis in the world won’t make a difference. “So we need money.” On the funding of hosting Ukrainian refugees from the existing UK aid budget, Mr Griffiths said: “It’s true that the needs of refugees in Britain are significant, are humanitarian, should be met. “But we would obviously prefer that that’s not taken out of the 0.5% aid budget which is already reduced from where it was before.” The UN has launched an appeal for a record £42 billion in aid funding for next year, as climate disasters and the Ukraine war have caused humanitarian needs to soar around the world.",Broadsheet,1

The Mayor of London said the accommodation provided by the Refugee Housing Programme (RHP) would support Ukrainians and Afghans who have fled conflict and are homeless, at risk of homelessness or living in unsuitable temporary accommodation. According to the mayor’s office, there are 16,000 Ukrainian refugees living in London under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and hundreds of Afghans accommodated in Home Office bridging accommodation sites in the capital. The new programme is aimed at easing the expected pressure on local accommodation schemes as bridging accommodation sites and the initial six-month Homes for Ukraine commitment comes to an end. Mr Khan said he has allocated £126 million to the RHP from the Government’s £500 million Local Authority Housing Fund. The money will be used to fund new home acquisitions, including refurbishing existing or newly acquired homes, purchasing new-build properties or developing new homes. The scheme is set to run until March 31 next year. In the long term, the homes delivered through the RHP will be returned to councils and housing associations to become social or affordable rented homes available for Londoners on the housing waiting list or who require temporary accommodation. Mr Khan said: “I’m committed to supporting refugees who have come here to rebuild their lives and do everything I can to help them thrive in their local community. We need the Government to urgently step up and provide the right funding to local authorities, the voluntary sector and immigration advice services so that every refugee in need has the home and support they need Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan “That’s why I’ve announced a new programme which will see City Hall deliver up to 600 affordable homes for Ukrainians and Afghans fleeing conflict, giving those who have been through such harrowing upheaval the stability they deserve. “I’m doing all I can to build a better and fairer London for everyone by helping councils house refugees through my existing Right to Buy-back fund, and I’m helping migrants and refugees navigate the complex immigration system by funding advice services to provide new arrivals with key information about their rights.” He also called on the Government to dedicate more services to assisting refugees. “There are still too many refugees living in unsuitable accommodation,” he said. “We need the Government to urgently step up and provide the right funding to local authorities, the voluntary sector and immigration advice services so that every refugee in need has the home and support they need.”",Broadsheet,1

In a recent interview, the 61-year-old actor - who fled Ukraine in February while filming a VICE documentary about Russia's invasion of the country - discussed returning to the war zone.  ""My intention is to go back into Ukraine. But I'm not an idiot, I am not certain what I can offer,"" Penn told Hollywood Authentic.  Speaking about his time in the country earlier this year, he added: ""The only possible reason for me staying in Ukraine longer last time would've been for me to be holding a rifle."" ""So, where I am in life is short of doing that, but if you've been in Ukraine [fighting] has to cross your mind. And you kind of think what century is this?"" Penn continued. ""I was at the gas station in Brentwood the other day and I'm now thinking about taking up arms against Russia? What the f*** is going on?"" he questioned. Penn has been a prominent voice in speaking out against Russia, previously urging the US to ""invest everything"" into supporting the country and its people, or lose sight of ""what America hoped to be"". The actor's nonprofit CORE (Community Organised Relief Effort), which he founded in 2010, is currently supporting Ukrainian refugees in Poland. ""I've got plenty to do with CORE on the receiving side of refugees in Poland,"" Penn said. ""I'm shooting more for the documentary, but I'll be doing a last-minute assessment of what value that will have."" He concluded: ""Long term, we don't have any tangible evidence that documentaries really change anything. We just don't. We only know they can give hope.""

2599,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,21/3/2022,973 words,PHIL MCDUFF,Traditional conservatism is subverted by Ukraine crisis,"Recent weeks have seen an upsurge in sympathy for the plight of displaced Ukrainians in the wake of Putin's shock invasion of the country. The Home Office is suddenly under fire for being slow to offer aid to those in need, even from the right-wing opinion formers who until a few weeks ago would incessantly demand the exact opposite. There are several plausible explanations for why Ukrainians have received such a markedly different response to, say, Iraqis or Libyans over the years. For a start, as has been demonstrated by various unguarded remarks by certain sections of the media, Ukrainians seem to have become racialised as white, ""blue-eyed"" Europeans, in contrast both to the dark-skinned, Muslim populations of the Middle East, or indeed to the populations of Romania or Poland, who have been subjected to demonisation and stereotyping in the British press under the generic banner of ""Eastern European"". Secondly, many of the conflicts that have triggered previous waves of refugees are the result of our own foreign policy, or those of our allies. We cannot afford to be too concerned with what they are fleeing from, lest we implicate ourselves. In contrast, Putin's actions in Ukraine have propelled Russia back up to its Cold War position as our favourite official enemy nation. There is no conflict between condemning Russia as the instigator of a brutal invasion and drawing attention to the predicament of the Ukrainians fleeing the war zone. Whatever the reason, Ukrainian refugees seem to be seen as more ""genuine"" - both in sectors of the press and by the public - unlike ""bogus asylum seekers"" taking advantage of us, and we are therefore more inclined to accept them. Whatever the cause of the sharp change in sentiment, it has run afoul of a major issue. The UK has spent several decades making the process of migrating here more difficult, time-consuming and costly. From the opening of migrant detention centres under the New Labour government in the early 2000s to the Nationality and Borders Bill currently before parliament, the trend has been towards tightening, restricting and preventing immigration, with concessions towards ensuring the safe and humane treatment of refugees being little more than lip service in practice. As a result, Ukrainians trying to come to the UK have faced a system described as ""humiliating"". The UK's insistence on requiring visas, in contrast to other European countries, has introduced many Ukrainians to a system which is both byzantine and Kafkaesque by design, its very complexity and inaccessibility a part of the system of deterrence. Responding to the change in public sentiment, the government launched a new ""Homes for Ukraine"" scheme. Under this, people in the UK can offer to sponsor visas and provide rooms or homes for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict. But as Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, has said, the government is still insisting on visas. ""The government is relying on what is effectively a managed migration route to respond to a humanitarian crisis,"" he writes. ""This inevitably means paperwork and bureaucracy are being put before people's urgent needs."" Even in the face of overwhelming public support for accepting Ukrainian refugees, the government finds itself incapable of simply doing the right thing. Daniel Trilling, author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the borders of Europe, said: ""It looks like the government wants to pick and choose which groups of refugees it offers help to."" As Trilling points out, ""this threatens to undermine a key principle of the international system for refugee protection, which is that everyone has the right to seek asylum regardless of where they're from. If every country behaved like the UK, that international system would quickly disintegrate."" But is such a cherry-picking approach to humanitarianism even possible? There are deeper issues being revealed here. The institutions through which state power is expressed have an inertia to them. They are lumbering behemoths - as you would expect from organisations tasked with the management of millions of people. The ideological underpinnings of the UK's asylum system are deeply conservative. Like the benefits system, it is designed with the assumption that everyone applying should be first assumed to be a fraudster or scrounger, and that they must prove that they are not. However, there is a caveat to this: we don't mean me or my friends or other people that we like. The nature of Johnsonism, in particular, has brought this undercurrent to the surface. The exceptions to the rule were definitely going to include you and yours, because the prime minister acts like your pal who gets that you're not one of the scroungers. At last, the British state would be making sure the right kind of people were getting special treatment and those ""others"" would be suffering at its hand. We are seeing in real time that this myth cannot hold up. If you design a border system to exclude as many people as possible, to punish before it helps, then that is exactly what it will do, even if you try to carve exclusions into it. Large, lumbering beasts of bureaucracy will not read the mind of Dave in Essex and ask if he really meant these refugees when he voted for a party which promised to tighten the system. It will simply respond to the rules and practices that were put in place because millions of people voted for them. There is a hard lesson to be learned here: to have a system capable of helping the most vulnerable, it must help everyone. If we do not err on the side of too much compassion, we will instead err on the side of cruelty. There is no point, in 2022, asking why the Home Office is behaving this way towards Ukrainians who clearly deserve better, when it is simply doing exactly what we have asked it to do.",Broadsheet,1

The squatters broke into the property at around 1am on Monday and declared that it ""belongs to Ukrainian refugees"". The street has been cordoned off with at least 10 police vehicles and more than 30 officers at the scene. A Scotland Yard spokesperson said officers completed a search of the property early in the afternoon and found no protesters inside. Officers wearing harnesses first tried to deploy a ladder to access the balcony but after the squatters sat in the way to obstruct them, a JCB crane was moved in to lift them up instead. Police wearing riot gear used a drill to break open the front door and enter the house. The squatters call themselves the London Mahknovists, after Nestor Makhno, who led an anarchist force that attempted to form a stateless society in Ukraine during the Russian Revolution of 1917-23. They hung a Ukrainian flag as well as two signs which read ""this property has been liberated"" and ""Putin go f*** yourself"". They also danced, played music and one man sang lines from the Dirty Dancing song (I've Had) The Time Of My Life. Mr Deripaska has been described as ""a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch"" who is ""closely associated"" with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin.

2618,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,19/5/2022,431 words,Rory Sullivan,"Almost 60 million people displaced worldwide, says study","The number of people displaced within their own borders rose to an all-time high by the end of 2021, a new study has shown. A total of 59.1 million people had been forced to leave their homes and live elsewhere in their countries as a result of violence or disasters as of December last year, according to data collated by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). This is up from the 55 million internally displaced persons (IDPs ) recorded in the IDMC's previous annual world survey. The increase was largely driven by the high numbers of new IDPs in Afghanistan, Burkino Faso, Ethiopia and Yemen, the IDMC said. More than half of all IDPs are now under the age of 25, while 25.2 million of this group are under the age of 18, raising significant questions about the effects of global instability on younger generations. Of all the internal displacements driven by conflict and violence last year, 80 per cent of them occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa due to fighting in places including the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and Somalia. Similarly, four in every five displacements triggered by disasters in 2021 took place in Asia and the Pacific, with China, the Philippines and India the countries most affected. Commenting on the report, Jan Egeland, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council , which set up the IDMC 24 years ago to document IDPs who would otherwise go ""unseen"", said the findings showed the world was in a state of ill health. ""The world is falling apart, too many countries are falling apart,"" he said. ""2021 was, as we documented here, a very bleak year and 2022 is proving to become even worse,"" he said, adding that the war in Ukraine would lead to a new record this year. ""It's a damning indictment of the world's lack of ability for conflict prevention and conflict resolution,"" he added.  53.2 million people were living in #internaldisplacement at the end of 2021 after fleeing #conflict & violence.This increase is mostly driven by growing numbers of #IDPs in #Afghanistan , #BurkinaFaso , #Ethiopia & #Yemen.

2622,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,20/3/2024,801 words,Cate McCurry,Leo Varadkar: Youngest ever taoiseach who played key role in Brexit negotiations,"Leo Varadkar became Ireland’s youngest ever Irish premier when he took up the reins of the government at the age of 38 in 2017. His rise to the top made history as he became the first person from an ethnic minority to become taoiseach and he is also the country’s first gay leader. Born in Castleknock in 1979, Mr Varadkar is the son of an Irish nurse and an Indian doctor. He joined the centre right youth wing of the Fine Gael party while studying medicine at Trinity College Dublin. At the age of seven, he announced he wanted to become the minister for health when he grew up. “My mum wanted me to be a doctor like my dad, and at seven, I really wanted to be a politician, and I managed in my mind to combine the two,” he once said in an interview. After succeeding Enda Kenny to the role of Fine Gael leader, Mr Varadkar held the post of taoiseach from 2017 until 2020, and then returned to the role in 2022 following an historic agreement with Fine Gael coalition partners Fianna Fail and the Green Party. Now aged 45, he has made the shock decision to step down as Taoiseach. On Wednesday, Mr Varadkar made his way to the front doors of Government Buildings, joined by his ministerial party colleagues. At 12.14pm he delivered his resignation statement, to the surprise of many in Government circles and across the political establishment. Emotional and holding back tears, Mr Varadkar struggled as he said he was no longer the best person for the job. His speech was met with rapturous applause from ministers and party staff gathered on the steps at the Merrion Street office. It was during a radio interview in January 2015 that Mr Varadkar came out as gay and said he would be campaigning in support of the same-sex marriage referendum later that year, some 22 years after homosexuality was decriminalised in the Republic. He has been in a long-term relationship with doctor Matthew Barrett. While his election as taoiseach was feted as Ireland’s transition from a conservative Catholic country to an outward-looking socially liberal one, Mr Varadkar’s own political views are conservative. While social protection minister Mr Varadkar launched a campaign on welfare cheats, he advocates free markets and only made known his pro-choice views on abortion in the run-up to the historic referendum in 2018. During Mr Varadkar’s time as taoiseach, Ireland passed the landmark referendum to liberalise its strict abortion laws. He also played a key role in the Brexit negotiations, with a famous meeting with then-prime minister Boris Johnson at a manor house on the Wirral in England seen as a significant moment in paving a way for the deal on the UK’s exit from the EU. The agreement staved off the prospect of a hard trade border being introduced on the island of Ireland, but it did prompt years of further political turmoil, particularly within unionism in Northern Ireland, over the creation of a so-called Irish Sea border on the movement of goods between the region and Great Britain. Mr Varadkar was taoiseach at the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020 and announced a lockdown in arguably his most famous address while on an annual St Patrick’s Day trip to Washington DC. His detractors will point to Ireland’s ongoing housing shortages and chronic problems within the health service as his government’s major failings. The political establishment in Ireland has also been under increasing pressure on migration issues over recent times, with an influx of tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers from elsewhere in the world heaping further strain on state services and accommodation stock. His party suffered a major blow when Fine Gael lost seats in the 2020 general election, which ultimately led to the historic coalition with its biggest political rival, Fianna Fail, and the Green Party. The Government suffered another major defeat after it lost the recent twin referenda on family and care. The result on the care issue was the greatest loss of a referendum in the history of the state. In his resignation speech, Mr Varadkar cited the development of the National Broadband Plan, increasing public infrastructure spending in housing, healthcare facilities, schools and climate action and the welcoming of Ukrainians as some of his achievements. He also pointed out that he will leave office as the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement are working again and the country’s trading relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit era is stable. The findings of the most recent poll revealed that Mr Varadkar’s approval rating is sitting at 41%, ahead of Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald with a rating of 39%. But Fine Gael now faces a difficult few months as it battles to find a replacement leader who will bear the tough responsibility of steering the party through a general election.",Broadsheet,0

Now the 81-year-old, who sold his original boat for £480 for charity, is using his second version, Tintanic II, for use in his latest fundraising bid.

Further trips will include the Beaulieu river in the New Forest, the River Medina on the Isle of Wight and the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London. Mr Stanley, who served in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards for 35 years, told the PA news agency: ""Having done the canals, I want to do something a bit more salty, a bit more edgy, so this year I am taking to the sea. ""I have a target of £5,000 because all of my friends have already given and perhaps people are a bit harder up than they were before. ""But anyway we are all having a lot of fun and it's fun for me and I really enjoy talking to people when I'm out and about."" Describing his motivation to support Ukrainian refugees, he said: ""We have seen such terrible pictures on the television and people are in absolute dire straits and anything I can do to help in a very small way will go some way to helping."" Mr Stanley said he had an open target of about 50 miles for the challenge, depending on the weather. He said that the Tintanic was up to the job and added: ""It's very seaworthy, I have made a few alterations, the cross beam is now made of oak rather than plywood and it's pretty robust.""

High Commissioner for Refugees says. The war in Sudan , which has displaced nearly 2 million people since April, is but the latest in a long list of crises that has led to the record-breaking figure.  “It’s quite an indictment on the state of our world,” Filippo Grandi, who leads the U.N. refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva ahead of the publication Wednesday of UNHCR 's Global Trends Report for 2022.  Last year alone, an additional 19 million people were forcibly displaced including more than 11 million who fled Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in what became the fastest and largest displacement of people since World War II. “We are constantly confronted with emergencies,” Grandi said. Last year the agency recorded 35 emergencies, three to four times more than in previous years. “Very few make your headlines,” Grandi added, arguing that the war in Sudan fell off most front pages after Western citizens were evacuated.  Conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Myanmar were also responsible for displacing more than 1 million people within each country in 2022.  The majority of the displaced globally have sought refuge within their nation’s borders. One-third of them -35 million -have fled to other countries, making them refugees, according to the UNHCR report. Most refugees are hosted by low to middle-income countries in Asia and Africa, not rich countries in Europe or North America, Grandi said.  Turkey currently hosts the most refugees with 3.8 million people, mostly Syrians who fled the civil war, followed by Iran with 3.4 million refugees, mostly Afghans. But there are also 5.7 million Ukrainian refugees scattered across countries in Europe and beyond. The number of stateless people has also risen in 2022 to 4.4 million, according to UNHCR data, but this is believed to be an underestimate.  Regarding asylum claims, the U.S. was the country to receive the most new applications in 2022 with 730,400 claims. It's also the nation with the largest backlog in its asylum system, Grandi said.  “One of the things that needs to be done is reforming that asylum system so that it becomes more rapid, more efficient,” he said.  The United States, Spain and Canada recently announced plans to create asylum processing centers in Latin America with the goal of reducing the number of people who trek their way north to the Mexico-U.S. border.  As the number of asylum-seekers grows, so have the challenges facing them. “We see pushbacks. We see tougher and tougher immigration or refugee admission rules. We see in many countries the criminalization of immigrants and refugees, blaming them for everything that has happened,” Grandi said.  Last week European leaders renewed financial promises to North African nations in the hopes of stemming migration across the Mediterranean while the British government insists on a so-far failed plan to ship asylum-seekers to Rwanda, something UNHCR is opposed to. But there were also some wins, Grandi said, pointing to what he described as a positive sign in the European Union's negotiations for a new migration and asylum pact, despite criticism from human rights groups.  Grandi also celebrated the fact that the number of refugees resettled in 2022 doubled to 114,000 from the previous year. But he admitted this was ""still a drop in the ocean."" ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",Broadsheet,0

He will discuss how Ireland and the EU can support the country and will also witness first-hand the devastation caused by the Russian forces. Mr Martin will restate Ireland’s full backing for continuing sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime, for Ukraine’s path to full EU membership, as well as Ireland’s commitment to work with the EU on the reconstruction of Ukraine. The spirit and resolve of the Ukrainian people has inspired us all, and Ireland will provide every support for Ukraine’s path to full EU membership, and continue to welcome and support civilians fleeing this war Taoiseach Micheal Martin “The people of Ireland stand with Ukraine and its people in the face of Russia’s immoral and unprovoked war of terror,” he said. “The bombardment and attacks on civilians are nothing short of war crimes, and I will use my visit to express Ireland’s support for moves to hold those behind these attacks fully accountable. “The spirit and resolve of the Ukrainian people has inspired us all, and Ireland will provide every support for Ukraine’s path to full EU membership, and continue to welcome and support civilians fleeing this war.” Mr Martin’s trip comes two weeks after President Volodymyr Zelensky invited him to visit Ukraine. It is the first visit by a Taoiseach to the eastern European country. It also comes after Mr Putin on Monday declared victory in seizing the eastern Ukrainian province of Luhansk, with his troops escalating their offensive in neighbouring Donetsk. Mr Martin has warned previously that the Russian president appeared to be leveraging its natural gas supplies to exert maximum pressure on Europe ahead of the winter period. The Taoiseach has also been a vocal advocate for Ukraine’s fast-tracked membership of the EU. Mr Zelensky has previously thanked Ireland for its “active support of Ukraine’s European aspirations”. Ireland has also taken in more than 36,000 Ukrainian refugees since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine at the end of February. The Irish State has given 20 million euro in humanitarian support and assistance to the country, as well as health equipment and medical donations worth more than 4.5 million euro. In April, Simon Coveney became the first foreign minister of the UN Security Council to visit Kyiv, and met Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and defence minister Oleksii Reznikov. Mr Coveney also visited the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of the capital, where suspected killings of civilians prompted global condemnation.",Broadsheet,1

With an eye on a general election, the Prime Minister brought another ally closer by moving up Claire Coutinho from education minister to replace Mr Shapps as Energy Secretary. Mr Shapps said he was “honoured” to take over from Mr Wallace and vowed to continue British support for Ukraine in its fight against Vladimir Putin’s “barbaric invasion”. But, having never held a role at the Ministry of Defence, his credentials to take on the role during a major war in Europe were questioned. Lord Richard Dannatt, a former chief of the general staff of the British Army, praised Mr Wallace for doing a “good job” in his four years in the post. “And now we have a new Defence Secretary who knows very little about defence, and it’s a complex portfolio. It will take him quite some time to get up to speed,” Lord Dannatt told Sky News. Former armed forces minister Mark Francois, a member of the Commons Defence Committee, said it will be an “incredibly tough act to follow” for Mr Shapps. “I think, to put it mildly, because it’s such a complex department, this is going to be a very steep learning curve for Grant Shapps,” the Tory MP told GB News. “Grant Shapps is a bright bloke, but he’s going to have to come up with the speed very, very quickly.” Mr Shapps is seen as an effective communicator and will be key for Mr Sunak as he leads the Tories towards the general election, expected next year. The war in Ukraine had been a prominent feature of Mr Shapps’ tenure as energy secretary, as he sought to mitigate the effects on fossil fuel availability. He visited Kyiv last week and his family has hosted Ukrainian refugees in their home after the Russian president launched his invasion last year. Mr Shapps is one of Westminster’s most prolific users of TikTok, where he covered his own trip to Ukraine despite ministers being banned from using the Chinese-owned app on official devices over security concerns. Mr Sunak first appointed him to the role of business secretary on his entrance to No 10. Mr Shapps served as Liz Truss’s home secretary for six days and Boris Johnson’s transport secretary until September. Climate campaigners welcomed Mr Shapps’ departure from the energy brief. Friends of the Earth said: “He seemed to be more concerned with playing childish politics on social media than the serious policies needed to address the greatest challenge of our time.” Mr Wallace confirmed his departure as defence secretary on Thursday morning after announcing his intentions last month. No 10 will hope appointing a close ally to the role will cool tensions over spending, with Mr Wallace having frequent run-ins in an attempt to boost MoD coffers. In his resignation letter to the Prime Minister, he wrote: “I know you agree with me that we must not return to the days where defence was viewed as a discretionary spend by Government and savings were achieved by hollowing out.” Mr Sunak praised Mr Wallace, who was a captain in the Scots Guards before entering politics, for having “served our country with distinction”. The Prime Minister had been expected to launch a full reshuffle before the Tory party conference in October but now appears to be holding off. Conservative MP David Johnston was given his first ministerial role as he steps up from the backbenches to replace Ms Coutinho as education minister. Shadow defence secretary John Healey congratulated Mr Shapps for being appointed Defence Secretary but hit out at “13 years of Tory defence failures”, arguing that “a change at the top will not change this record”. The Liberal Democrats accused Mr Sunak of appointing a “yes man” to the key role, calling for an end to the Tories’ ministerial “merry-go-round”.",Broadsheet,0
2657,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,10/3/2022,1127 words,Andrew Feinberg,What Vice President Kamala Harris didn't say in Poland,"As Ukraine entered its third week of defending itself from Russia 's unprovoked invasion, Vice President Kamala Harris has emerged as one of President Joe Biden 's go-to emissaries to key allies in America's effort to shore up Ukraine's defence and coordinate aid and relief efforts with Nato allies.  The vice president left Washington on Wednesday for a two-leg trip to Poland and Romania - both ex-Warsaw Pact nations that have joined Nato over the decades since the fall of the Soviet Union.  Perhaps more importantly, both of her destinations share land borders with Ukraine, and in the weeks since Russia began attacking have taken in many of the approximately two million refugees the United Nations estimates to have fled their homes.  At the vice president's first public appearance - a bilateral meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki - the Polish leader thanked Ms Harris for ""the unity of the Western world,"" while she commended the ""extraordinary work"" performed by the Polish population to welcome the largest flood of European refugees since the Second World War.  At a joint media availability with Polish President Andrzej Duda a short time later, Ms Harris again praised the ""leadership"" shown by Polish citizens, telling reporters: ""we've witnessed extraordinary acts of generosity and kindness. We have seen through images on the television -looking at images of ordinary people doing extraordinary things in support of the dignity and the wellbeing of perfect strangers"" The vice president later announced a $50 billion contribution to the UN World Food Programme and pledged to ""continue"" with US efforts to support the work Mr Duda and the Polish people have undertaken to bear the burden of this latest refugee crisis.  Read the latest on the invasion of Ukraine here Ms Harris also reaffirmed what Mr Biden has called America's ""ironclad"" support for Nato and the mutual defence provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty, and vowed that the US - together with Poland - would do ""everything together, in partnership, in solidarity, to support what is necessary at this very moment in terms of the humanitarian and security needs of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people"". Under questioning from a Polish journalist, she described the US-Poland relationship as ""deep, enduring, and strong"" and said the crisis brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made it stronger still. At a time when Russian president Vladimir Putin's escalating military adventurism and bombastic rhetoric about reclaiming territory of a ""greater Russia"" has put former governments and residents of former Soviet bloc states on edge, Ms Harris touched all the bases in her remarks. But what she left unsaid and the issues she did not raise underscore the fact that there are some gaps in the relationship between Washington and Warsaw that aren't likely to be resolved so long as the threat of Russia looms.  Those Polish planes  Ms Harris denied that the Pentagon's rejection of a plan - floated earlier this week by Mr Duda's government - to place Polish Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets ""at the disposal"" of the US for eventual retrieval and use by Ukrainian pilots.  US defence officials appeared caught unawares when the Polish government issued a statement about the plan earlier this week after repeated pleas for the aircraft from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby put the kibosh on the proposal at a Wednesday press briefing, telling reporters the US intelligence community had found the Polish jets were ""not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities,"" and would provide ""little increased capabilities at high risk"" of being seen as Nato escalating the conflict. When asked what the US was prepared to do to bolster Ukrainian air defence in the absence of a plan to provide aircraft familiar to Ukrainian pilots, Ms Harris pointed to what she called the ""ongoing process"" of delivering anti-armour and anti-aircraft missiles to Ukrainian forces.  Mr Duda interjected to say Poland had ""behaved in such a way as a reliable member of Nato should behave"" by involving the US in the proposal to provide Ukraine with the Soviet-era jets, and tacitly defended the US response. But the continuing reports of Russian atrocities in Ukraine, most recently Wednesday's bombing of a maternity hospital - and Mr Zelensky's impassioned pleas for the West's help to ""close the skies"" above his country - mean the issue of how far to go in arming Ukrainian forces is not going away any time soon.  Will the US take in Ukrainian refugees?  Asked whether the United States would ""make a specific allocation for Ukrainian refugees,"" Ms Harris responded with nervous laughter before remarking: ""A friend in need is a friend indeed"". The vice president said she had discussed the matter with Mr Duda and reiterated her previous praise for Poland's efforts to absorb the record flow of Ukrainians fleeing Russia's destruction.  However, she made no commitment beyond pledging that the US would remain ""absolutely prepared to do what we can and what we must to support Poland in terms of the burden that they have taken"".  What about the rest of the Biden administration's prior concerns about Poland?  When Ms Harris and Mr Biden took office in January 2021, Poland's current position as a key ally on Nato's eastern flank was not the most pressing facet of the Washington-Warsaw relationship. Instead, the Biden administration was looking to prevent Poland from continuing the democratic backsliding that has kept the country in an ongoing constitutional crisis since the Polish Law and Justice party gained unified control of the presidency and parliament in the 2015 elections.  One potential source of tensions was diffused in late 2021, when Mr Duda vetoed a law that would've required US-based Discovery Communications to offload control of TVN24 - Poland's most-watched news channel and one of the last independent television stations in the country.  But the vice president's remarks showed how the present crisis brought on by Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed a whole host of issues to the side. Not once did Ms Harris mention LGBT+ rights, press freedom, the importance of an independent judiciary, reproductive freedom, or the need for free, fair elections - all top priorities in what she and Mr Biden have tried to characterise as part of a foreign policy that promotes democracy in a global battle against autocracy.  As long as Russia looms, those issues will most likely remain on the back burner as far as the US-Poland relationship is concerned. ",Broadsheet,0

Artists, community leaders and members of England's award-winning women's soccer team were also among the more than 1,100 people included in this year’s list, the first to be signed off by King Charles III.  May, who is also an animal welfare campaigner, was appointed a knight bachelor for his services to music and charity. The former Queen guitarist, who also holds a doctorate in astrophysics, said he regarded his new title as “a kind of commission to do the things one would expect a knight to do — to fight for justice, to fight for people who don’t have any voice.” Mary Quant , the 92-year-old designer best known for popularizing the miniskirt during the 1960s, received the U.K.'s top honor for her services to fashion. Quant’s appointment to the Order of the Companions of Honor, a special status held by no more than 65 people at any one time, came seven years after she was made a dame — the female equivalent of a knight — in recognition of her designs. Artist Grayson Perry, known for his tapestries and ceramics, was also knighted for services to the arts. Elsewhere, diplomats shaping the U.K.'s response to the war in Ukraine were recognized, with damehoods for the ambassadors to both Kyiv and Moscow, and a British Empire Medal (BEM) for a campaigner who led donation drives for Ukrainian refugees. Nanny Louenna Hood, 37, who raised more than 160,000 pounds through online auctions, said she was “completely stunned” to be recognized.  “I started the campaign, but I would never have been able to do it without the community,” she said. Half of this year’s honors went to women, including members of the England soccer team that won the 2022 Women's European Championship and the first woman to lead a major U.K bank.  England captain Leah Williamson received an OBE, while teammates Lucy Bronze, Beth Mead and Ellen White were all made MBEs. Alison Rose, the chief executive of banking group NatWest and the first woman to run one of the U.K.'s largest banks, was also awarded a damehood. U.K. monarchs have awarded honors as part of orders of chivalry since the Middle Ages. In modern times, nominations are submitted to the government’s Cabinet Office and vetted by a committee before being passed on to the prime minister and the monarch for approval. Others honored this year included those campaigning for environmental and climate change action, youth engagement and combating discrimination. Britain’s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, who received a knighthood, was among several Jewish community leaders to be recognized.",Broadsheet,0
2662,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,1/3/2022,1069 words,Editorial,"Ukrainians need open, unconditional, generous help - now","The images coming from Ukraine of bombed-out apartment blocks and the hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing for their lives speak of the terror enveloping a blameless people. It demands an immediate humanitarian response. It is a looming disaster. Ukrainian refugees need open, unconditional, generous help. Now. We say: Refugees Welcome.   The Independent is calling for authorities across the west to respond to a clear and present danger to life and public health - to do whatever it takes to save lives and protect families. We need to supply aid to Ukraine , to the surrounding countries dealing with the refugees, and indeed to help Ukrainians find safety in Britain. Here's how:  We have started a petition with change.org to call on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to a nation in need. Please sign here We have also started a fundraiser in partnership with gofundme.org.uk to raise money for the thousands of men, women and children who are fleeing the fighting in Ukraine. Your donations will go to charities on the ground, including the Red Cross, who are supporting refugees crossing the border into Ukraine's neighbours - Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova and Slovakia - as well as people displaced from their homes within Ukraine. Please give generously  Aid on the border  In the short term, we know that the shivering refugees have to be offered shelter, warmth, food and comfort for themselves and their children. They need access to phones and the internet. They need these things right now, particularly in the borderlands around Ukraine.  The need is extremely urgent and local, and we have partnered with charitable organisations to deliver accommodation, clothing, food, sanitary goods, medicines, toys and other necessities to those who have had to leave their homes and loved ones behind. The money is needed - and needed now.  Welcome all Ukrainians  We cannot know how long this war will last, or what course it will take. In the short to medium term, many frightened Ukrainian people will wish to join relatives in Europe for temporary safety and shelter. They naturally will want to return home when they can - but what they will go back to, or when, is uncertain. At the moment, the official response in the UK for those seeking asylum in this way has been found wanting. It is not good enough to relax the visa requirements, as the British government has now done. There needs to be a far more big-hearted, liberal approach to accepting refugees. Indeed, the UK's obligation to accept refugees is absolute under the relevant international conventions.  As with unaccompanied Syrian children, and the Afghans who helped British forces and agencies during the war, the government has shown a lack of compassion and urgency in facing up to its obligations.   Provide protection  The Nationality and Borders Bill, currently going through parliament, is designed to weaken those international legal responsibilities. That means that Ukrainians who are desperately trying to reach the UK - however they can - can be denied asylum without any chance to plead their case. Indeed, the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to go further by making it an offence even to make the journey, meaning those arriving could be deported to a third country or jailed. If not removed or imprisoned, people will be granted a form of temporary status which affords them no access to benefits and no family reunion rights, and will be regularly reassessed for removal - leaving them in a perpetual state of uncertainty, and given a lower status than the rest of society.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has raised the alarm that this two-tiered approach will also breach the 1951 Refugee Convention and unnecessarily ""stigmatise"" people feeling persecution. This is no way to treat defenceless people running from President Putin's missiles. There is significant opposition to these inhumane moves, and more pressure is needed. We must urge the government to think again and consider the human cost of the new policy, and the more support it receives, the more chance that orderly and practical routes for asylum seekers will be established and the people traffickers stopped. That will benefit any Ukrainian refugees, and many others too with a proper claim to be offered a place of safety.  Resettlement scheme  In the longer term, depending on what happens in Ukraine, there may be a need for more refugees to be settled in the UK. This may be true whether they have relatives in Britain or not. More widely, there is also an obvious need to replace the smuggling routes across the English Channel with what are termed by the government ""safe and legal"" routes - but there is a distinct lack of these routes available.  Official data shows that the number of people who come to Britain under refugee resettlement schemes has plummeted by 75 per cent in the last four years. The Home Office scrapped its numerical target on refugee resettlement last year, prompting calls from charities for the UK to commit to taking 10,000 refugees from around the world through these schemes annually.  These calls have so far gone ignored. These commitments will have to be increased if events in Ukraine trigger another mass movement across Europe. Given that President Putin has been threatening war for weeks, if not months, woefully little has been done by western governments who, as we know, had remarkably accurate intelligence about his intentions. Because of that failure of preparedness, the need to act now is even more pressing.  It is time to extend the hand of help and declare: Refugees Welcome.  The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

2669,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,12/8/2023,589 words,Will Gore,My children have been taught a lesson by a Ukrainian refugee – and so have I,"If you love them, set them free,” so the saying goes. But what if the gilded cage you’ve surrounded them with is too comfortable to want to leave? I asked myself that question this week, as I dutifully sliced an apple for my 13-year-old daughter. I had already cut, toasted and buttered a bagel for her; and poured some cereal and milk into a bowl for her younger brother. They had sat at my parents’ kitchen table, eating their breakfast, before heading off to watch whatever screen was nearest to hand – both still pyjama-clad – leaving me to tidy up. They had both been perfectly pleasant about it all, and I’d not had to demand pleases or thank yous. In other circumstances, I would not have blinked twice at this fairly standard breakfast routine. But on this occasion, there had been another child present, and his breakfasting habits had thrown my children’s ways into sharp focus. Five months ago, my parents opened their home to two Ukrainian refugees , a young woman and her nine-year-old son. Her English was pretty good; his was limited – although he and my son bonded over the shared language of football and Minecraft. In the time since their arrival, the Ukrainians have respectively started a job and school, and they have settled into English village life. They seem to find living with my parents bearable; and my folks rather like having some youngsters in the house. This week, my children and I had added to the household for a few days. The kids played, while I took advantage of my parents’ proximity to my office and headed to work each day. But before leaving in the morning, I sorted breakfast out, thinking it would be useful to relieve my mum and dad of a minor burden. On Thursday, as my two cosseted children waited patiently for their father to serve their meal, their new Ukrainian pal arrived in the kitchen, already dressed, and began to root around in the cupboard. He eventually found the small frying pan he’d be looking for, smartly lit the hob and began to heat some oil. Next, he cracked an egg into the pan, before chopping some pieces of smoked sausage in too. Without any fuss whatsoever, he finished his cooking, ate his meal, washed up the implements he’d used, rinsed the plate, then put it in the dishwasher. Finally, as a coup de grace, he began to make his mother – who was elsewhere, getting ready for work – a cup of tea. What a boy, I thought. My next response was to look at my own, delightful children, and wonder why they were quite such lazy little wretches who wouldn’t even butter a piece of toast, let alone fry an egg. I determined that the law should be laid down; that no more would they be free to swan about and be waited on hand and foot by their parents. They were an embarrassment; a disgrace; a pair of wanton layabouts who had been shown up by a boy who six months ago had been living in a war zone. I rang my wife and said we must put up with it no longer: the children must learn to stand on their own two feet, come what may. “But it’s not them,” she replied, “it’s you. You’re an enabler!” It sounded harsh. I protested. But when I later told my daughter about the conversation, she concurred. “Why do you think we ask you, and not mum?” she said. So, there we have it – it’s me, I’m the problem. I have sheltered my children from the rigours of life because I adore them so much, but also because I can’t bear to see anyone do something more slowly or messily than I could do it myself. But no more! I love them, so I will set them free – even if they do trash the kitchen.",Broadsheet,1

The EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA) said 966,000 asylum applications were made in the 27 EU countries as well as in Norway and Switzerland last year, which is up 50 per cent from 2021.  That doesn’t include more than four millionUkrainian refugees who were granted temporary protection in the EU through the Temporary Protection Directive, a special mechanism activated to avoid collapsing already backlogged asylum systems. The European agency linked the increase to the continuing easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions, increasing food insecurity and conflicts in many parts of the world.  Although most asylum-seekers enter the EU legally, mainly by plane with travel visas, some also crossed the EU’s land and sea borders without permission, mainly through the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean. With Syrian people submitting the highest number of applications, people from Afghanistan were second, fleeing the spiraling security, humanitarian and financial troubles that followed the Taliban takeover in August 2021, with 129,000 requests. Applicants from Turkey were the third top nationality for asylum seekers. They doubled in numbers last year with 55,000 requests.  Soaring inflation and “democratic backsliding” were among the factors believed to have caused the increase, the agency said. In many places, reception centers are overwhelmed, leaving asylum-seekers in the streets. It is thought the recent earthquake that killed nearly 46,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Turkey and Syria may lead to a surge in irregular border crossings into Greece.  Germany offered earlier this month to temporarily ease visa restrictions to some earthquake survivors while Spain promised to resettle a small group of 100 vulnerable Syrian refugees from Turkey, which is home to four million refugees. Venezuelans, Colombians, Bangladeshis and Georgians also applied for asylum in record numbers last year, as did Moroccans, Tunisians and Egyptians.  Some four per cent of asylum-seekers in 2022 defined themselves as unaccompanied minors. The EUAA increased its technical and operational support last year, with the number of countries benefitting from that support quadrupling since 2019. A total of 13 member states benefitted from the EUAA Operational Support including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, Greece, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain. This involved deploying over 1,500 personnel. The agency is also providing support in Moldova.   Which countries in Europe have asylum seekers applied to?   An EU migration report has revealed the top five countries that received applications in 2022  The EUAA didn’t say which EU countries received the most applications last year.  But an internal EU migration report seen by the Associated Press lists Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Italy as the top five. Asylum authorities issued decisions on more than 600,000 applications last year but they received even more new cases, adding to the existing backlog.  Of the applications analysed, 40 per cent were granted refugee status or subsidiary protection. This was mostly for Syrian, Belarusian, Eritrean, Yemeni, and Malian applicants, as well as for most of the Ukrainians who chose to apply for asylum instead of temporary protection. ",Broadsheet,0

The Friends with Benefits star was born in the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi. In 1991, when she was seven, her family fled from Soviet Ukraine to the United States.  In a new interview with Maria Shriver for Conversations Above the Noise , Kunis said: ""People were like, 'Oh, you're so Eastern European.' I was like, 'I'm so LA! What do you mean?' Like, my whole life I was like, 'I am LA through and through.'"" Kunis said that because she identified so strongly as an American, for a long time, being Ukrainian felt ""irrelevant"" to her, despite having close friends in the country and visiting it with her husband, the actor Ashton Kutcher. She said that whenever people would ask her where she was from, she'd say she was Russian for ""a multitude of reasons"". Kunis continued: ""One of them being when I came to the States and I would tell people I'm from Ukraine, the first question I'd get was, 'Where is Ukraine?' And then I'd have to explain Ukraine and where it is on the map, and I was like, 'Ugh, that's exhausting.'"" She soon realised that if she said she was from Russia , people would know where she meant. ""I was like, great, I'll just tell people from Russia,"" she said. Kunis said everything changed for her when Russia invaded Ukraine last month. ""This happens and I can't express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, 'Oh my God, I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,'"" she said. ""It was the weirdest feeling."" She said she will no longer be telling people she's from Russia. ""Hell no, I'm from Ukraine!"" she said. Kunis and Kutcher have raised over £13m to aid victims of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Last week, the couple announced that they will match donations of up to $3m (£2.5m) to help supply humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees. In a video appeal, Kunis said there was ""no place in this world for this kind of unjust attack on humanity"". Read The Independent's live updates on the conflict here.

2742,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,10/3/2022,477 words,Via AP news wire,Harris thanks Poland for helping 1 million Ukraine refugees," Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday praised the Polish people for their generosity for taking in more than 1 million refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine last month. Harris made the comments as she met with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki hours after the U.S. House passed a massive spending bill that includes $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine and its European allies. The legislation includes $6.8 billion to care for refugees and other economic aid to allies. ""I've been watching or reading about the work of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, and so I bring you thanks from the American people,"" Harris said. Harris also met with Polish President Andrzej Duda, and the two were scheduled to hold an afternoon news conference. Later Thursday, the vice president was slated to meet with Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland since the Russian invasion began. The vice president is also scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while in Warsaw. The Canadian leader has been in Europe in recent days meeting with allies about Ukraine. Harris' whirlwind visit to Poland and Romania was billed by the White House as a chance for the vice president to consult with two of the leaders from eastern flank NATO nations about the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Already, more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine - with more than half coming to Poland - and even more expected to arrive in the days ahead. But differences between Warsaw and Washington over a Polish plan to send Soviet-made fighter jets to a base in Germany for Ukraine's use have cast a shadow over Harris' visit to Poland. Just as Harris arrived in Warsaw late Wednesday evening, the Pentagon definitively rejected the idea. The proposal was publicly floated by Poland - without first consulting the U.S. - days after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was ""very, very actively"" looking at a proposal under which Ukraine's neighbor Poland would supply Kyiv with Soviet-era fighters and in turn receive American F-16s to make up for their loss. Polish government officials, however, insisted any transfer of planes must be done within the NATO framework. On Wednesday, the Pentagon shut the door on the prospect of NATO transferring jets to Ukraine, saying such a move with a U.S. and NATO connection would run a ""high risk"" of escalating the Russia-Ukraine war.  Gen. Tod D. Wolters, the commander of U.S. European Command, said in a statement Thursday that the ""most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of anti-tank weapons and air defense systems."" That effort by the U.S. and allies is ongoing, Wolters added. Harris will travel on Friday to Bucharest, where she's to meet Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.",Broadsheet,1
2779,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,21/10/2022,564 words,TOM PECK,A farce is meant to be funny,"The national lottery runs a game called Set for Life, in which the winner receives £10,000 a month for the rest of their earthly days. So if you're trying to work out quite what it was that Liz Truss was smiling about as she absolutely smashed the record for shortest ever British prime minister (and without even having to die to do so), it's important to remember there are upsides. That's exactly what she's won. A £120,000 a year payout, for evermore, is what ex-prime ministers receive. A token of the nation's eternal gratitude for absolutely, absolutely nothing. Humiliated forever but, you know, still set for life. Is it a farce? Fawlty Towers was a farce. Farces are funny. Liz Truss clearly thinks, on some level, it's hilarious. But we all have our coping strategies. If it feels surreal for all of us, imagine being her. It's barely two months since she bought her Margaret Thatcher costume. She must regret not renting it. Still, no one can say she didn't get a lot done. Alright, so she got nothing done, but there were some great moments. Sacking your chancellor for the crime of agreeing with you about absolutely everything, and then appointing a replacement with whom you disagree about everything, and then telling him to reverse all of your policies in the hope it might help you cling on? That kind of dysfunction is one for the Guinness books, even these days. And all who witnessed it should, in some regard, consider themselves grateful. Not even the eight sentences she could be bothered to read out came close to articulating that she had a clue what she'd done or what had happened. There are rising interest rates everywhere, rising energy prices. The consequences of Putin's war in Ukraine are felt everywhere. Poland is trying to find homes for five million Ukrainian refugees. So how do you get to the bottom of Britain being the only country that is making an international tit of itself? Liz Truss clearly hasn't. Nor will she ever. The self-regard is too sociopathic, the cocksuredness backed up by considerably less than nothing. We should know by now that things only ever get worse. The TV cameras had not yet panned away from the Downing Street door before odd little Tory MPs had appeared, agitating for the return of Boris Johnson. The Tory party has now completed its extremely high-budget advertising campaign to prove that it is entirely incapable of governing the country. It should surely be able to work out that if it returns to the person it threw out before this one, it will only be making that case ever more forcefully. Already the evidence is clear that they're going back to the only thing they actually know how to do. Manoeuvring and machinating, factionalising. That a once-serious country seriously has to hear, yet again, talk of who is backing who in a Tory leadership contest. Suella? What's Gove up to? Jeremy Hunt's ruled himself out. Rishi Sunak's the bookie's favourite. Just spare us. Please, please just spare us. A week from now, in theory, there'll be somebody else standing on the steps of Downing Street, giving yet another moist-eyed, breathy speech about how much they love their country, about everything it has given them. About unleashing Britain's potential. Enough's enough. No more now. Just unleash yourselves, gallop off over the horizon and never come back. No one even cares if you take your winnings with you.",Broadsheet,0
2788,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,13/3/2022,553 words,Via AP news wire,Invasion jolts Russia's friends in tiny West-leaning Moldova," Across the border from war-engulfed Ukraine , tiny, impoverished Moldova - an ex-Soviet republic now looking eagerly Westward - has watched with trepidation as the Russian invasion unfolds. In Gagauzia, a small, autonomous part of the country that's traditionally felt closer to the Kremlin than the West, people would normally back Russia, which they never wanted to leave when Moldova gained independence. But this time, most have trouble identifying with either side in the war.  Anna Koejoglo says she's deeply conflicted.  ""I have sisters (in Ukraine), I have nephews there, my own son is in Kyiv,"" the 52-year-old said, quickly adding that her other, younger, son is studying in Russia.  ""My heart is (broken), my insides are burning,"" she told The Associated Press. Koejoglo is one of Moldova's 160,000 Gagauz, an Orthodox Christian people of Turkic origin who were settled there by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. They make up over 80% of Gagauzia's population, but only 5% of Moldova's 2.6 million people.  In the early 1990s, when landlocked Moldova voted to leave the Soviet Union, its Gagauz and Russian minorities wanted to stay. But unlike Russian-backed separatists in eastern Moldova who took up arms in 1992 to establish the unrecognized, breakaway Trans-Dniester area - which Russia essentially controls, maintaining some 1,500 troops there - the Gagauz in the south chose to compromise.  In 1994, they reached an agreement with the government in Moldova's capital, Chisinau, settling for a high degree of autonomy. Still, Gagauzia has maintained a strong relationship with Russia, where many Gagauz find education and job opportunities. Its population generally opposes the pro-Western shift embraced by ethnic Moldovans who account for 75% of the country's people. For Peotr Sarangi, a 25-year-old Gagauz, the old ties still hold strong.  ""(The) Gagauzian population supports Russia more, many remain pro-Russian,"" he said.  Although Moldova is neutral militarily and has no plans to join NATO, it formally applied for EU membership when the Russian invasion began. It's also taken in about a tenth of the more than 2.3 million Ukrainians who fled their country for safety. Ilona Manolo, a 20-year-old Gagauz, has no qualms in laying the blame with Moscow. ""I think that Russia is at fault. ... I'd rather support (Ukrainian) refugees,"" than Russia, she said.  There's similar sentiment elsewhere among Moldova's rich patchwork of ethnic minorities - even expressed by ethnic Russians who live outside the separatist region of Trans-Dniester.  One of the latter group, Nikola Sidorov, described the invasion of Ukraine as a ""terrible thing."" He said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin ""went too far (and) needs to calm down.""  The 79-year-old added that the issue has become a subject of heated debates among his ethnic kin in Moldova's second largest city, Balti, where ethnic Russians make up some 15% of the population. An ethnic Ukrainian who lives in Balti said her sympathies were divided. ""I'm very sorry for the people of Ukraine ... but I also feel sorry for Russians,"" said Iulia Popovic, 66. ""I understand that it is all (happening because of) politics and that the situation is very difficult."" ___  Follow the AP's coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",Broadsheet,0

What is a worthy victory, and what is actually fair? The mammoth public vote for the Ukrainian Eurovision entry was one thing, but international football raises emotions (and tempers) to a whole other level. Fortunately for Scotland, facing a World Cup qualifier against the Ukrainians, the atmosphere at Hampden Park was not of pity, but joy. Artem, a young Ukrainian who has lived in Edinburgh since long before Russia's invasion, said the game means a lot more than simply proving that Ukraine and Ukrainians are surviving. ""Being in Scotland , there's not been a lot of opportunities to celebrate being Ukrainian without the backdrop of the war,"" he explained. ""For example, there's quite a lot of events, like demonstrations and protests and sort of gatherings, with a lot of refugees attending these in a few different cities in Scotland, just wherever they settled. ""But these are difficult to attend, not because of logistics, but because it's mentally difficult to confront the reality of a lot of these people, and to process everything that's happening. So a game like this is a great opportunity to celebrate being Ukrainian, and not necessarily forget about the war, but just be there."" The war aside, this was still a football game, meaning joyful is as joyful does. A great prize was dangled in front of Scotland -a win would have put them closer to their first World Cup since the 1998 tournament. But in the end it was not to be, with Ukraine securing a 2-0 commanding lead that led ultimately to a 3-1 victory that sent the estimated 3,500 fans at the stadium wild.  Let's do this together #SCOUKR pic.twitter.com/AipqF8lUz9 - Scotland National Team (@ScotlandNT) May 31, 2022 Earlier, many at Hampden Park had a tear in their eye as Ukraine's team entered the pitch, each draped in a Ukrainian flag, prompting a deafening roar. Ukraine's national anthem was roundly applauded by the Tartan Army who then belted out Flower of Scotland before the long-awaited game got going, if rather nervously. Back in December, before Russia began its brutal and unprovoked assault on its neighbour, it was the Ukrainian manager, Oleksandr Petrakov, who had to consider Scotland's feelings after he was seen jumping for joy when he found out who his team had been drawn against. ""Yes, I was joyful when the draw was made,"" he later said, ""but that was a natural reaction because we weren't drawn against Italy or Portugal. We weren't seeded. We could have had a horrible draw, so of course I was happy that we got Scotland. We avoided the really big teams. ""That's all. It wasn't a slight on Scotland. I apologise if people thought I looked too happy!"" The world has changed since then, not least by opening its arms to Ukrainian refugees - though sign-ups to the UK's already muddled sponsorship scheme have slowed down, meaning that Ukrainians leaving the areas currently under fire are at a huge disadvantage compared with the first wave. But the goodwill, for what it's worth, remains, and sport will be the better for it. To Artem, some of whose family are now gathered together for the first time since the conflict started, the game and its outcome transcend all that's happened since before Russia started the war. ""For me, it's celebrating belonging to both the Ukrainian community and the Scottish community,"" he said. ""It's not really about who's winning. Because after all, sport is more a celebration of one of the things it means to be human.""",Broadsheet,0

The staff, many of whom have worked at the mission for years, are believed to have been informed that they will only qualify for a visa if they have close relations in the UK. A number of British diplomats at the embassy, which has moved to Lviv from Kyiv for safety after the start of the war, are said to be deeply unhappy at the way their Ukrainian colleagues are being treated, and have made their feelings clear to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in London. Some British staff have described what is happening as ""Afghanistan part two"", and say they are astonished that lessons have not been learned from the failure to evacuate many Afghans entitled to entry to the UK after the Taliban takeover. They also fear some of their Ukrainian colleagues may be targets for retribution if they are in areas occupied by Russian forces. It comes as Russia continues to bombard cities across Ukraine, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of breaking a ceasefire agreement on Tuesday by shelling a civilian evacuation route from the besieged city of Mariupol. UK home secretary Priti Patel announced a migration route for Ukrainian refugees last week, under which she said tens of thousands of people would be able to come to Britain - but the scheme excludes those without family in the UK. Staff at the British embassy in Ukraine have been told that entry into the UK is a matter for the Home Office. When The Independent approached the department for comment, it said it was a matter for the FCDO, which claimed it was in fact a matter for the Home Office. The Independent was referred between the two departments five times. It is understood that the Home Office is planning to enable the Ukrainian staff members to come to Britain, but the department has revealed no detail on this. Some of the Ukrainian staff have left the country following the Russian invasion and tried to get to the UK on the understanding that they meet the conditions for entry. However, one person who applied for a visa online from Warsaw found that the application form required him to pay around £2,000 and show he had the means to pay for medical treatment in the UK. A former British diplomat who served in Afghanistan said: ""The UK government promised to learn some lessons after the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. They clearly haven't done so, because once again we have a situation where hard-working and dedicated embassy staff are not able to get themselves and their families to the UK. ""These are people who have worked for years for the UK, often on work directly at odds with Russian interests. They may be on a Russian list as Afghan colleagues were on Taliban lists. It would be unforgivable if we let these people down."" It comes after ministers came under fire when it emerged that thousands of Afghans who worked for the British effort in the country and were entitled to come to Britain were left behind during Operation Pitting, the mass evacuation of Kabul following the Taliban's advance on the capital. A whistleblower later revealed that tens of thousands of pleas for help from those under threat went unanswered in a system incapable of handling the situation, with some of those abandoned subsequently murdered by the Taliban and other Islamist groups.

Micheal Martin said ""everyone he has met"" in Northern Ireland wants continued access to the EU single market as he met Mr Johnson in London for talks. The Taoiseach's comments come after Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party would not resume the power-sharing arrangement until the UK-EU protocol row is resolved. Mr Martin suggested the hotly contested issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol would not be resolved by the time of the province's May elections - saying London and Brussels would strike a deal ""in the fullness of time"". Speaking to reporters ahead of talks with the prime minister in London, Mr Martin said business leaders north of the border thought the Northern Irish economy was benefiting from current arrangements. ""What's very interesting from our perspective, though, is that what's increasing and growing is a view within Northern Ireland, particularly in Northern Ireland business and industry, that the protocol is working in terms of inward investment into Northern Ireland, and in terms of access to the EU single market,"" he said. Mr Martin told reporters: ""So anybody I've met in Northern Ireland all want to continue access to the EU single market. It's a good basic principle to start off on."" However, Mr Johnson insisted that ""significant changes"" were still needed to the agreement, as foreign secretary Liz Truss continues to lead talks on easing border checks with her EU counterpart Maros Sefcovic. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""The prime minister reiterated the need to make significant changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and safeguard the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions. ""He said that while greater ambition and flexibility was needed from the EU in the negotiations, it was his hope that the same spirit of co-operation that had characterised the UK-EU relationship in respect of Ukraine could also be applied to resolving the issues with the protocol."" The Irish leader - who attended the England v Ireland rugby match at Twickenham on Saturday with Mr Johnson - defended his decision not to consult the UK before deciding to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees. ""It was never on that we would be acting outside of the European Union approach to this,"" he said. ""I think the UK would have been well aware of the direction of travel of the European Union in respect of this measure."" Asked if he would encourage Mr Johnson to take in more people fleeing the war in Ukraine, the Taoiseach said: ""Well to be fair I'm not here to tell Boris Johnson what to do,"" before adding: ""I have to acknowledge the leadership of the UK government in terms of the sanctions it has imposed on Russia."" The meeting in London follows the latest remarks by the DUPs leader, who was applauded at Crossgar Orange Hall on Friday night for saying his party would not re-enter the Stormont Executive until Mr Johnson's government acts to ""protect Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom"".

The online classroom has developed new functions guiding pupils through automatically translated versions of its lessons.

The translation function will build on earlier work translating the online lessons into common languages other than English spoken in UK schools, such as Urdu and Polish. Oak National said: ""The prototype was brought forward following the invasion of Ukraine which has led to widespread school closures and displacement of hundreds of thousands of children internally and to neighbouring countries."" The UK will shortly welcome up to 200,000 Ukrainian refugees with a large number of them expected to be school-aged children, Oak National said. Matt Hood, principal of Oak National Academy, said: ""It is tragic that the lives of so many children have been blighted by this horrific invasion. ""The work we have done to make Oak's lessons available in Ukrainian is only a tiny contribution to this crisis, and pales in comparison to the international effort needed to ensure the safety of families fleeing violence. ""We hope that for Ukrainian children who will be arriving shortly in the UK , it's a tool that may help them re-establish some sort of routine once they reach safety."" He added that the automated translation meant the lessons would not ""be perfect"" and were not an attempt to align with the Ukrainian curriculum or to replace Ukraine's own work providing remote education. ""Oak has been exploring whether our lessons can be translated into the common languages spoken by pupils in English schools for whom English is not their first language but, with the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine, we have pushed this work forward as rapidly as possible.""",Broadsheet,1

Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob   London   Saving face  President Biden has said that he is convinced that a Russian attack on Ukraine is imminent. He may be right. But if war is to be averted (and that, surely, is the priority), Vladimir Putin must be allowed to avoid losing face. Would it not have been wiser for Biden and others to suggest that, although the Russians are clearly prepared for such an event, Putin would be commended for his statesmanship if he refrained?  Susan Alexander   South Gloucestershire   Toddler ban  I tend to agree with Anita Slater that it is pathetic to banchildren under five from cafes. This does indeed seem a step too far and, of course by default, they are banning parents and carers. This is discrimination of a rather hostile kind and not a user-friendly environment I would want to be part of. As she states, we are all aware of fractious children who won't be placated by a sticky bun, but surely that has always been the case and most people are charitable and patient about such strops. Conversely, they also bring life and animation to their surroundings and can amuse and distract in equal measure. But it is true that to place this embargo says more about the owners of such an intolerant establishment, than the customers who frequent its hallowed environs. Parents and children should be made welcome, they are in libraries and churches so a high street café shouldn't be so precious and see the bigger picture and make their establishment child friendly and inclusive, whatever the age of its participants.  Judith A. Daniels   Norfolk   Police questionnaire  We are told that the prime minister has submitted his questionnaire about the gatherings he attended in Downing Street and believes that he has not broken the law. That is not the point. He told Parliament that there were no such gatherings during lockdown. He then said that there were gatherings but they followed the rules. He then said that there were leaving parties but they were work events, subsequently, there have been photos showing him with people who were engaged in social activities that were denied to the rest of the population. The evidence is clear that he has continually twisted the truth to serve his own ends. One wonders how economical he has been with the truth when completing his questionnaire. This is an appalling breach of trust that sullies the government and its reputation internationally. If he cannot be trusted over relatively minor matters, how can we trust his honesty and judgment over national and international matters on which the safety of our citizens and those in other countries depends? Any Tory MP with a shred of decency must recognise that, regardless of the outcomes from the Met enquiry, Boris Johnson has to go for the good of us all.

2898,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,17/12/2022,775 words,SUNDER KATWALA,More immigration could be key to making Brexit work,"Immigration was a central feature in the choice for Brexit. Without the loss of public confidence in how successive governments, both Labour and Conservative, had handled the scale and pace of migration from the EU after 2004, it is unlikely that there would have been a narrow 52-48 vote to leave. Many different arguments were made to sell Brexit to the slim majority who voted for it. Many hoped to see immigration fall significantly; while Priti Patel argued there would be more non-EU visas to ""save the curry houses"". The claim that Turkey was about to join the EU was pitched aggressively at those who feared rising migration. The legacy of that decision has been a surprising one. Immigration to Britain has increased, rather than reduced. Attitudes towards immigration have become more positive, though the heated and polarised political and media debate lags behind. Brexit led to significant changes in immigration policy, with the end of EU free movement and a new points-based system. Boris Johnson placed much less emphasis on cutting numbers, ditching Theresa May's target to reduce net migration. So non-EU migration rose, due to government policy choices, to make it easier for international students to stay after graduating, to attract doctors and nurses to the NHS and to offer a new visa route to Hong Kongers. Immigration has remained high because of those policy choices. It was exceptionally high this year, with net migration hitting half a million, partly due to the large inflow of Ukrainian refugees. Nobody could claim this was a case of a government foisting high immigration on an unwilling public. Rather, tens of thousands of individual Britons who wanted to host Ukrainians in their homes had to battle the bureaucracy to secure a visa. The high numbers are a political headache for the government with its own voters. Six out of 10 Conservatives would like overall numbers to come down - but do not favour reduced migration for the NHS, for students or for care workers. They would also let more fruit pickers come here to work. Two-thirds of Labour voters would not reduce overall levels of immigration. The Labour Party does not believe in an overall net migration target. Rather than entering an auction to reduce the numbers, it should focus on how to manage migration fairly, balancing domestic training and migration to fill skills gaps; ensuring fair funding for public services when population changes; and taking a positive approach to promoting citizenship and integration. There is a much more heated immigration debate about asylum. Dangerous journeys across the Channel are nobody's idea of a safe or well-managed asylum system. Yet the public and political debate is polarised between advocates of tough measures, hoping to deter anybody claiming asylum in Britain, and those who want to see a compassionate asylum system. Most of the public don't want such a binary choice - believing that a competent government could deliver an asylum system that is orderly, fair and humane. Doing so presents challenges to all sides of the political arguments. Yet those who see border control as the litmus test of post-Brexit sovereignty cannot deliver this in reality without negotiating with other sovereign states, such as France and Belgium. Governments that want migration via legal routes will struggle to make trafficking unviable if those routes do not exist. Overall attitudes towards Brexit have shifted. Changes of mind have been less important than generational shifts in the electorate. Four-fifths of adults who were too young to vote in 2016 think Brexit was a mistake.Labour in opposition remains deeply cautious about the idea of softening Brexit. That reflects electoral geography, with liberal voters more clustered in urban and university seats than the red wall marginals. Most Labour voters would like a softer Brexit, but the leadership has ruled out reopening the issue of the single market and free movement, keeping the new post-Brexit points system. So Brexit has not produced the fall in immigration that some hoped for and others feared. This presents a dilemma for liberal pro-migration opponents of Brexit. Some may see a tactical advantage in highlighting Nigel Farage's sense of ""betrayal"" that the numbers did not come down. But there may be a more strategic case for welcoming the broadening of consensus on the positive contribution that migration can make to Britain - lowering one of the barriers to the UK rebuilding closer relationships with its European neighbours from outside the single market and, perhaps one day, within it again.

2912,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,23/3/2022,635 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,Homes for Ukraine scheme is nothing to boast about yet,"Within hours of the UK's Homes for Refugees scheme portal going live last Monday, the government boasted that 44,000 members of the British public had already registered their interest in hosting those who have fled the war. Most will be aware that the figure has since climbed to more than 150,000. Off the back of this, Sajid Javid said he expected to ""see hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians arrive here in the UK"". The health secretary told LBC this week that this shows how the UK is ""supporting Ukraine in every single way that we can"", echoing levelling up secretary Michael Gove's claim last week that the scheme draws on ""our proud history of supporting the vulnerable in their hour of greatest need"". The sponsorship scheme, launched on Friday,allows Ukrainians with no family links to come to Britain and be hosted by members of the public, who will be paid £350 per month for doing so. With millions of Ukrainians having fled from their homes, many of them now languishing in crowded humanitarian centres in bordering countries, one would expect that the 150,000 rooms being offered in the UK would be quickly filled up. A warm and secure home is exactly what these traumatised women and children are in desperate need of right now. But progress on actually getting refugees into UK homes under the scheme appears to be slow - perhaps not yet even happening at all. The government has refused to reveal how many Ukrainian refugees have applied to the scheme since it opened for applications on Friday - quite a contrast to the speed and willingness with which it gave out the figures on people coming forward to host. Charities are convinced the number of applications so far will amount to a ""trickle"". Lawyers say the application process is ""convoluted"" and ""nigh on impossible"" to complete, with ""very difficult"" forms to fill in and all documents submitted required to be in PDF format - a difficult feat when many are applying from crowded spaces from their mobile phones. Before they even get to this stage, the scheme requires that each Ukrainian refugee applying can name the person in the UK who will host them. Mr Gove made the questionable suggestion last week that this could be done via social media. This led to a flood of Facebook pages being set up designed to ""match"" hosts with refugees - prompting concerns it leaves vulnerable people exposed to abuse. To make matters worse, volunteers working with refugees on the ground in bordering countries say most Ukrainians are not even aware that the scheme exists - or if they do have no help to apply. One charity said there were no UK representatives encouraging refugees to go to the UK, adding that there was ""no guidance on the UK visa applications at all"". The government could prove that these are not legitimate problems by agreeing to publish the numbers for the scheme and showing us that in fact large numbers have applied - but it has refused to do so. Everything we know so far points to an application process that is complicated and difficult to access, not least for people who have just fled a war zone. To actually help Ukrainians, the scheme must be far more accessible and go further than inviting 150,000 Brits to click a button to say they would like to help. There is nothing to boast about yet. The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

2913,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,31/3/2022,640 words,Emma Burnell,Voices: Ukraine has shown Britain what progressive patriotism can look like,"The situation in Ukraine - and the response of its people from Zelensky downwards - has shown that a positive narrative of national identity is perfectly possible. Neither does it have to be denied to achieve a sense of international solidarity or national change and development. Now is the perfect time for progressive people in the UK to ask how we too could adopt this narrative of national solidarity to build a better future. When I was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, nationalism in Britain was seen, particularly on the left, to be synonymous with fascism. This was not unreasonable, knee-jerk thinking. There were fascists marching in the streets and running for elections, and as such, the potent national symbols they claimed as theirs - like the flag of St George and the Union Jack - were rejected by people who had all too often seen them in pamphlets from far-right candidates. In the 1990s, there was a reasonably successful attempt to change all of that, as Britpop dominated culture, and football and celebratory lad culture supplanted grunge in the national consciousness. ""Things can only get better,"" thought the left, as it embraced nationalism with varying degrees of success.  But as the pendulum swung back - from Iraq and migrant scare stories, through to Brexit and austerity - pride in the UK fell out of fashion. Britpop was seen as too Blairite; the Union Flag was claimed by Leavers and too often rejected by dismayed Remainers. But this is not how the general public feels. These attitudes exist only in the unreal worlds of social media and hyper-political activism. They do not reflect the country's natural sense of belonging together as a national community. That is a sense the left should and could feel part of - it is the very definition of collectivism, after all. During the past month, we have seen the contrast between Ukraine's proud national sense of identity and solidarity, and the ""Nazi"" image the Russian propaganda tried to paint it as. This has sat in sharp contrast with the bullying sense of national authoritarian entitlement coming from Putin. When you are patriotic only under pain of death or imprisonment, that pride doesn't really run that deep.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here The spirit of 1945 that the left is so rightly proud of comes from our post-war sense of national solidarity. Without the deprivations of war, the impetus to build the welfare state, the NHS and a vast wave of social ""homes for heroes"" might never have existed. And while it is unlikely we will see UK boots on the ground, our interdependent world will see the home front suffering deprivations, thanks to a series of worldwide crises. Our national response to the global pandemic has helped us build strong bonds of communities as we supported each other through two difficult years. Our national generosity has been shown in the people's - if not the government's - openness to welcoming Ukrainian refugees. We have much to be proud of, and a story of national collectivism to relate that can - and should - shame the government's hard turn back to austerity and individualism. We can counter Priti Patel's small island narrative of closed borders and a hostile environment with one that makes us proud of the national spirit of giving and welcoming. Now is the time for us to give up our squeamishness about nationhood and celebrate a future narrative of what Britain can be, when given the right chance and the right leadership. Now is the time to truly remember the lessons of 1945 and apply them properly. We can use this post-crisis opportunity to take up the mantle of the great socialists and reformers, and make Britain a place we can feel proud of again.",Broadsheet,0

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) official said the prime minister's time ""would be better spent addressing Home Office dysfunction"" over the Britain's response to the refugee crisis. Mr Johnson is ""desperate"" to pay a trip to Ukraine to ""experience what is happening there"", the Conservative party chairman Oliver Dowden has confirmed. Requests had been made to the FCDO regarding the possibility of Mr Johnson visiting Ukraine in-person, The Independent understands. But the departmental official warned there were ""huge risks associated with such an operation for both UK officials, special forces and Ukrainian security concerns"". They added that an in-person visit from the prime minister was not a top priority for the Ukrainian government. Two chief requests from Ukrainian counterparts remain - sending more arms and aid, and easing the flow of refugees to the UK, the official said. Both Labour and Tory MPs have attacked the Home Office's slow response in allowing Ukrainian refugees to come to Britain, and campaigners have condemned home secretary Priti Patel 's insistence on visa requirements. The FCDO official also noted that US officials had been at pains to note that president Joe Biden would not visit Ukraine during his trip to neighbouring country Poland. This was important in order to not to inflame tensions with Russia yet further. A visit from a UK or US premier would require logistical support that could, if it met with Russian forces, risked igniting a live engagement between a Nato member and Russia, the official said. This is the same issue that Nato leaders said prevents them from securing Ukraine's skies from Russian attack, as it could lead to a vast escalation of the conflict. The Tory party chairman defended Mr Johnson's desire to go to Ukraine, arguing that the risky visit would be important to let the PM ""see what's going on, on the ground"". ""It's actually to experience what is happening there, to see what is happening to the people on the ground,"" Mr Dowden told LBC - suggesting he wanted to meet president Volodymyr Zelensky in person. ""It's very different talking to somebody on the phone versus actually seeing it in practice,"" the Tory chair said. The cabinet minister also clarified that no decisions have been taken yet, following reports that British security officials are ""having kittens"" about the prime minister's requested visit. No 10 said on Tuesday that Mr Johnson would consider travelling to Kyiv if invited - though the prime minister's spokesman said president Zelensky had not, at this time, requested that the PM visit Kyiv. A senior Ukrainian security official told The Independent that he had heard that Mr Johnson has expressed interest in showing his solidarity with Ukraine by travelling to meet president Zelensky. The official, who has been to London and is known to Western officials, stressed that no official approach has been made about a visit by the prime minister by British officials. But he pointed out that Ihor Zhovka, the Ukrainian president's advisor on international relations had invited president Biden to visit Kyiv. He also pointed out that the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic met Mr Zelensky in Kyiv after travelling by train from Poland. Britain's standing in Ukraine is extremely high at present after supplies of arms to the country. Mr Johnson received a warm welcome during a visit to Kyiv in January in the run-up to the war.

2918,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,30/9/2022,703 words,David Klepper,Russians push baseless theory blaming US for burst pipeline,"The Kremlin and Russian state media are aggressively pushing a baseless conspiracy theory blaming the United States for damage to natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea in what analysts said Friday is another effort to split the U.S. and its European allies. The Russian position is also reverberating on social media forums popular with American conservatives and far-right groups. NATO leaders believe the damage to the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines between Russia and Germany is the result of sabotage. NATO has refrained from identifying a suspect pending an investigation into the damage. Russia began blaming the U.S. quickly after the damage was reported Monday night. On Friday, speaking at a ceremony to annex four Ukrainian regions, Russian President Vladimir Putin said “Anglo-Saxons” in the West were behind the “terror attacks"" but did not specify any nations. Pravda and other Russian state outlets reported Thursday that the U.S. operates underwater robots capable of carrying out the acts of sabotage. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman wrote about her suspicions of U.S. involvement in a Telegram post. “Europe must know the truth!” Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram Wednesday. The assertions of U.S. responsibility cite President Joe Biden’s threat in February to stop the recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine. “If Russia invades ... then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2,” Biden said. “We will bring an end to it.” The U.S. State Department has dismissed Russia's claims, with a spokesman calling them preposterous and saying the idea of U.S. involvement “is nothing more than a function of Russian disinformation and should be treated as such.” The two Nord Stream lines were not in operation but were filled with tons of methane that began bubbling to the surface following the damage. Russia recently shut off the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as it ramped up energy pressure on Europe. Nord Stream 2 has never been used. Fox News' Tucker Carlson played the Biden clip on his show Tuesday and brought up the possibility that the U.S. was behind the sabotage.  “If they did this, this will be one of the craziest, most destructive things any American administration has ever done, but it would also be totally consistent with what they do,"" Carlson said. Former President Donald Trump also reposted Biden's remarks on Truth Social along with a call for the U.S. to remain “cool, calm” in its relations with Russia. “Wow. What a statement. World War III anyone?” he wrote. Messages left with spokespeople for Fox News and Trump were not immediately returned on Friday. The suggestion that the U.S. caused the damage was circulating on online forums popular with American conservatives and followers of QAnon, a conspiracy theory movement which asserts that Trump is fighting a battle against a Satanic child-trafficking sect that controls world events. The claim's popularity among the American far-right and the speed with which it spread from Russian state media reflect mounting skepticism about America's role in the war in Ukraine, according to Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Stimson Center and an expert on security and energy. “Russia is quite good at capitalizing on these divides, but it doesn't create them,” she said. It's not the first time Russia has spread disinformation seeking to redirect blame for the war and undermine Ukraine's allies. Earlier this year, Kremlin-controlled media mounted a disinformation operation asserting the U.S. had been running secret bioweapon labs in Ukraine. Carlson helped amplify that theory too. Networks allied with the Kremlin have also spread frightening tales about Ukrainian refugees, and blamed atrocities committed during the war on Ukrainians. Seen in that context, the conspiracy theory alleging U.S. responsibility for the pipeline damage is consistent, the researchers concluded. “The central theme is that this is a “false-flag” operation, an American plot designed to convince Europe that it was a Russian attack intended to signal the vulnerability of Europe’s energy supplies,” the researchers wrote. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of misinformation at https://apnews.com/hub/misinformation.",Broadsheet,0

Micheal Martin said that housing and accommodation will need to be refurbished for the thousands of refugees fleeing the war-torn country. While many are being accommodated in hotels, the Government is attempting to source other properties. More than 7,000 refugees have arrived in Ireland, with the number expected to increase significantly in the coming days and weeks. Speaking in Washington DC on the second day of his trip to the US as part of the St Patrick's Day celebrations, Mr Martin said there is currently no estimate for how much the war in Ukraine will cost the Irish Government. Mr Martin said that some housing will need to be refurbished while the Government will look to procure hotels, B&Bs and other facilities. ""Those other facilities will have to be refitted and reconfigured to make them suitable for residential,"" Mr Martin said. ""There will be significant costs on the accommodation front. We have over 7,000 refugees that have come into Ireland. It is significant and it is growing but we, through the whole of government approach, we are doing everything we possibly can to procure as much as they possibly can."" Mr Martin said the sanctions against Russia by the EU and United States are having an impact on the country's economy. He also said that he hopes peace talks between Ukraine and Russia will lead to some results. ""I would hope that the current talks, tentative though they are, could yield some results in terms of the ceasefire and cessation of the violence in the first instance, then demilitarisation,"" he said.

""There are limits to what any government can do in a situation like this, and that is why this war should end. ""In the first instance because of the appalling death and destruction on the people of Ukraine and their cities and their towns, and also the broader danger it poses to the world in terms of an extension of that conflict. ""We are at a very dangerous moment in terms of where we are globally as a result of this war. ""Accidents can happen and we need to avoid that at all costs. ""But when in a war situation like this on the continent of Europe , where the sanctions that have been imposed by Europe and US are the severest kind that we create shocks to the system, it will create a degree of instability in the economy. It will create price pressures, particularly on energy, food and other commodities. ""Those are the realities of the fact that Russia has waged war on Ukraine and all of the consequences going from that. ""No government is going to be in a position to protect in its entirety their societies from those consequences. ""We took measures last week with respect to hauliers and so on. ""So into the future we keep this under review, I think the more targeted measures will probably yield the best results.""",Broadsheet,1

Andrew Smeaton, a 53-year-old from Quincy, flew from Boston to Frankfurt, Germany, then onto Krakow, Poland , last week before driving across the Ukrainian border into the war-ravaged country. He eventually reached his colleague Kris van Huystee in the western city of Lviv , driving him, his wife, their 12-year-old son, and pet dog and cat to safety in Poland. The chief information security officer at Boston-based tech company DataRobot told Boston25 that he made the 4,500 mile journey after learning that several of his 250 Ukrainian colleagues were stranded in the country following Russia 's invasion. ""I think it was just the right thing to do. Anyone would have done it,"" he said. Follow live updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine When he reached Poland, Mr Smeaton said that he came up against the challenge of getting a car to make the journey across the border. In the end, he managed to trade his wristwatch for a battered car which was low on oil and had its hood held in place with duct tape and set off on the journey with nothing but one container of gas, a pen knife and two bottles of water. On the drive into Ukraine, he said he passed several checkpoints and people questioned why he was headed into the country -while most were fleeing in the opposite direction. ""One of the Ukranians asked, 'Where are you going?' I said, 'Ukraine' and he said, 'I know, but why?' I said, 'I've got to pick up a friend,'"" he told Boston25. ""He pointed and said, '[But] the Russians, the Russians."" I said, 'Yeah, I know.' He just looked at me and said goodbye."" Mr van Huystee, an automation specialist for DataRobot who has lived in Ukraine for the last decade, said he and his family had been getting ""pretty desperate"", with him becoming increasingly concerned for his family's safety. ""It was very difficult for us to arrange transportation through the border... I was very scared for my family,"" he said. When he first saw his coworker arriving in Lviv, he was ""super relieved"", saying it ""really meant the world"" to him that Mr Smeaton had risked his own life to save the lives of him and his family. ""Seeing a familiar face, a guy who went out of his way to risk his life to come and get me, it really meant the world,"" he said. However, the danger wasn't over yet, with the group making the fraught journey back towards the border with Poland. ""It took 15 seconds for them to get in the car and we didn't speak the entire journey back until they got over the Ukraine border. Then there were tears,"" said Mr Smeaton. He added that it was far from being ""like the movies"", saying that ""there's no James Bond. There's no Aston Martin"". Now, Mr van Huystee feels he owes ""my life"" to Mr Smeaton and the colleagues are now working together to help others also fleeing Ukraine. ""Now we feel safe. We're in a good place. Andy and myself at DataRobot, we're just doing our best to get as many other people over here as possible,"" Mr van Huystee said. ""I owe him my life. He saved us. When I first got here, I told him I'd do whatever I can to help out with the operation."" The two men said they are staying in Krakow to work with World Central Kitchen, a nonprofit that is providing meals to Ukrainian refugees who have evacuated their homes and arrived into Poland.",Broadsheet,1
2929,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,12/3/2022,643 words,Olivia Fletcher,Voices: Mea Culpa: pooches and pet peeves,"Sometimes admitting we've made a dog's dinner of something is the tough but right thing to do. Case in point: an article we wrote about Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Hungary. In it, we said: ""One woman, holding a designer handbag, showed off her full-bred bichon frise poodle."" A ""bichon frise poodle"" isn't actually a full-bred dog, which is one whose parents are from the same breed. This makes the phrase ""full-bred bichon frise poodle"" an oxymoron. The dog is in fact a cross-breed. We'd have been better off omitting the word; it would have avoided the error and made the phrase more concise too. We also could have been less ambiguous when we mentioned the designer handbag. I think it sounds like the pet could be inside the woman's purse, like something socialite Paris Hilton would have done with her pooch in the Noughties. But it could also mean the woman was holding a designer handbag while showing off the dog.  Age isn't just a number: Simon Gamble wrote to us about an interview we did with Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos last week. We asked the Scottish musician nearing his 50th birthday how he'll stay stylish in his fifth decade. But Simon pointed out that he's about to leave that decade behind and enter his sixth. As the lyrics to the Franz Ferdinand song ""Take Me Out"" go: ""I say, don't you know?"" Well, I suppose sometimes we don't.   Armed struggle: Last week, we were guilty of tautology in one of our headlines. We titled an article: ""Distressing footage captures moment British journalists shot during armed ambush in Ukraine."" I think it's reasonable to assume the ambush was armed if journalists were being shot, which means we could have omitted ""armed"" for brevity's sake. And while we're here, I reckon we could have got away with omitting ""distressing"" from the headline too. Is there a situation we could imagine in which journalists being shot at in an ambush wasn't distressing? Probably not.  Lessons in sensitivity: Another headline qualm. Last week we published a letter from one of our editors about the death of cricketer Shane Warne with this headline: ""Ashes to Ashes: Warne dying shocked the same as Bowie"". It's a rather crass way to honour the spin bowler who took 708 wickets for Australia (and disrespectful to David Bowie, for that matter). We shouldn't have used the term ""ashes"" given how morbid it sounds. Fortunately, we changed the headline on our website. We went with: ""The news of Shane Warne's death was to cricket what David Bowie's was to music."" Thanks to Richard Thomas who pointed this out.  Reaching the limit: We could have made ourselves clearer in another editorial when we wrote: ""The government's response is embarrassing and shameful, and all the more so because it is so at odds with the sunny rhetoric of ministers promising uncapped and limitless schemes - whereas the reality is that the rules severely delimit their access."" John Harrison wrote to say that ""limit"" would have been the correct term to use. Delimit means to define the boundaries of something; we meant to limit, as in restrict. I find it's better to stick to simpler terms to avoid errors like this.   Several upsets: Our crusade against ""multiple"" isn't over yet, as a headline we wrote demonstrated last week. ""Multiple bombs rain down on Ukraine in dashcam footage,"" we said. Sigh. Even though many of our writers use ""multiple"" and ""several"" interchangeably, ""multiple"" just sounds much clunkier. Speaking of upsets, we misspelt Nuremberg (incorrectly written as ""Nuremburg"") last week when we mentioned the historic trials in a story about Russia's attack on a Ukraine power station. I think it's only right that we get the spelling of an important moment, er, right. We've corrected the spelling error on our website.",Broadsheet,0

Steady lines of people carrying backpacks and dragging suitcases formed at the border crossings and aid agencies warned the conflict could trigger one of the world's largest ever refugee crises. The UN said the situation was quickly deteriorating and called on countries to stand ready to support the thousands of displaced Ukrainians who were already ""starting to flee their homes to seek safety"" after Russialaunched an all-out invasion of its neigbhour by land, air and sea. The US has predicted that up to five million people could be displaced by the conflict, and Poland alone is preparing to receive up to one million refugees.  The International Rescue Committee urged EU member states to commit their support publicly, withsenior representative and former French minister Harlem Désir telling The Independent: ""This should not be looked at as another migration crisis. This is a crisis of war. It should not be business as usual, we need real support for the Ukrainian people."" At the border crossing in Medyka, Poland. Vitalii Koval, 50, who was fleeing with his wife and two young daughters, aged 3 and 5, said: ""It's the 21st century, why? It's just terrible, unbelievable."" Poland set up reception points for refugees near border crossings, and was preparing a medical train to transport wounded Ukrainians with a list of 1,230 hospitals that could admit the injured. Csaba Bodnar, 27, and his younger brother Tamas, had travelled to the Hungarian border to escape conscription into the Ukrainian military. ""No one wants to get conscripted, no one wants to die,"" Tamas said. ""It's clear that those who can, they flee."" According to local media, the Hungarian government is expecting 600,000 Ukrainians to cross the border. One NGO in Poland said their phones had not stopped ringing since early Thursday morning as Ukrainians tried to flee.  ""Until yesterday the Ukrainians we talk to were saying they didn't want to panic, that they didn't have plans to move,"" said CEO of Forum Migracyjne, Agnieska Kosowicz. ""Then from early this morning we started receiving calls of people crying over the phone, asking how they can flee."" Ukrainians living in Poland, of which there are around 1.5 million, were in a ""panic"" because many of their loved ones in Ukraine are unable to leave, Ms Kosowicz told The Independent. Local officials have drawn up lists of accommodation for an influx of refugees. ""There are some 300,000 places identified for people if they arrive, but I don't think this is sufficient,"" Ms Kosowicz said. ""I don't think Poland is prepared for anything bigger than a few million people. Last year Poland evacuated 1,000 people from Afghanistan, and it was a huge challenge to the Polish system."" Slovakia's prime minister Eduard Heger said that Ukrainians fleeing their country should be treated with ""compassion and understanding"".  In Portugal, prime minister Antonia Costa said Ukrainians were ""very welcome"", adding: ""Your family, friends and acquaintances who want to seek safety and destiny to continue their lives are also very welcome."" Germany 's interior minister Nancy Faeser offered support to eastern Europe countries ""in the event of large refugee movements"".  She said Germany was in discussions with the European Council on whether to trigger a law that would offer Ukrainians an unbureaucractic way to receive temporary protection in the EU. ""All member states should tell the EU Commission and Poland that they are ready to welcome refugees,"" said Mr Désir of the International Rescue Committee. ""They should give figures for the number of people they can take in and those numbers don't need to be a limit."" ""All European states and other democracies should commit to welcoming them. Ukrainians share our values, that's why they are being attacked, and why they need our full support.""",Broadsheet,1

Beth Winter MP, who represents Cynon Valley in South Wales, said the UK “should welcome every single human being who comes to our shores”. Bell Riberio-Addy, who represents Streatham, said France is not always a “safe country” for people arriving in small boats to return to. She told demonstrators: “I went to Calais a few months ago and I can tell you Calais is anything but safe. Barbed wire fences, guards who destroy people’s tents every single night, people who move people along as though they were animals.” She also said the UK accepts fewer refugees than other European countries and that Home Secretary Suella Braverman cannot name a single legal route for asylum seekers to enter the UK when she claims they exist. Dawn Butler , who represents Brent Central, said the Government wants to “lock up” pregnant women and children with the new law. Richard Burgon , who sits for Leeds East, said he had never seen a Bill “so vile, so sick, so disgusting, so immoral, so depraved” before Parliament in his lifetime. PCS deputy president Martin Cavanagh said the Government was “sending people to their deaths” with its earlier “pushback” policy on Channel boats, adding: “It was racist, it was abhorrent and it was murder.” He said he is “very proud” of the way union members working for Border Force responded to that policy. He added they “didn’t just sit there and accept it, they didn’t just say, ‘we’ve got to implement this, it’s nothing to do with us’ – they were clear they were not going to implement that, they were not going to take it”. Stand Up To Racism co-convenor Wayman Bennett told the PA news agency before the protest: “We are shocked and concerned the Government is talking about breaking international law. “This is normally reserved for international pariahs, not the original signers of the Convention (on Human Rights). It is not illegal to claim asylum, it is a right to claim asylum Wayman Bennett “There are no safe and legal ways of claiming asylum for the vast majority of refugees and we know this because the majority of people who ask for refugee status have received it even if they have come on boats. “It is not illegal to claim asylum, it is a right to claim asylum.” Pete Firmin, 73, travelled from Kilburn in north-west London to Westminster to attend the demonstration. He said: “The proposal to send everybody to Rwanda without processing any claims at all is just inhuman. “The protest will achieve very little, unfortunately, because the Government has a large majority, but it is important to show our opposition. “For the Labour Party to oppose it solely on the basis of not thinking it will work is not good enough.”",Broadsheet,0

Lily Smirnova, a 33-year-old from the Lviv region, has worked in marketing for more then 10 years but recently began visiting an orphanage in western Ukraine several times a week. Ms Smirnova estimates 120 children aged two to six are staying at the orphanage, the exact location of which she would not reveal for security reasons, and there are preparations to welcome more. The group is made up of refugees from orphanages across Ukraine, with many having fled from Eastern Ukrainian areas such as Mariupol as Russian attacks worsened. Ms Smirnova brings with her paint, brushes and other art supplies which she has noticed have ""inspired"" the children. ""This creativity and freedom, the mix of the two, I believe is helpful for these specific kids especially that (have) suffered a lot,"" Ms Smirnova told the PA news agency. ""They fled from their territories in their usual location ... they experienced bombing nearby and being in a shelter. ""Mostly the goal of this project is to get them out of that negative feeling. ""I really believe that this freedom and creativity is something that is really healing them from the inside ... you are forgetting about everything that is happening in the real world."" Ms Smirnova said she could see a difference in the children's demeanour before and after the sessions. ""We had a kid who had the choice to pick a colour and he picked black - his paintings were black, he painted his face with black. He's from Mariupol,"" she explained. ""But at the end of the day, he looked at himself in the mirror and (said), 'No, no, no, this is not the colour I want. I want something bright, maybe like the sun.' ""At the beginning of the sessions, kids are very closed... There are not many smiles, they are very serious kids. ""(But they) open themselves, they are engaged in something and they are really open to this."" At the beginning of the sessions, kids are very closed (but they) open themselves.

Ms Smirnova added that while the painting sessions are ""chaotic"" it is also an opportunity for other teachers to rest. ""They have a rest and then they can come back to kids more energised,"" she said. ""But definitely what we do see at the beginning and the end of the session is that they are different kids, they are so bright and laughing after the sessions.""

2976,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,18/4/2022,687 words,STEVEN FRANK,"In 1945, Britain gave me a home - but would it today?","I will never forget the day I arrived in this country as a hungry, frightened nine-year-old. A British RAF pilot had spirited my family to Britain in the back of his fighter plane from Theresienstadt concentration camp, after it was liberated by Allied forces in May 1945. As we were waiting to be processed at an RAF reception centre, a kind old bobby took pity on my two brothers and me, teaching us our first words of English and slipping us each a sixpence and a smile. I remember it as the first time that a policeman in uniform had ever shown us anything but cruelty. This small act of kindness was just a taste of the wonderful welcome I would receive from the people of this country in the years to come. Since then, I have become a proud Brit, and raised wonderful children and grandchildren. But the generosity and values that I most admired are today being trampled on. If the government's new immigration proposals go ahead unchanged, a future version of me - from Ukraine, or fleeing repression elsewhere - is likely to be treated very differently. They will be denied protection, criminalised, and may even be sent to a detention centre in impoverished Rwanda. As a small boy, I witnessed the march of Nazi jackboots through the cobbled streets of my native Amsterdam. My father joined the Dutch resistance, and, as a respected Jewish lawyer, became involved with hiding Jews and providing false documents to allow them to escape Holland. One morning in 1942, he kissed us all goodbye and headed off to work. I never saw him again. My family and I were sent to a Nazi transit camp before being crammed into a cattle truck and sent on to Theresienstadt. I still remember the stench of faeces, urine, sweat and fear in that sweltering carriage, and the relief when the doors were thrown open, only to find ourselves in a place worse than we could have imagined. In the camp, we experienced the gnawing pain of hunger and witnessed human suffering on an indescribable scale. With the scenes on the television news in recent weeks, I cannot help but recall those terrible years. When I see the crowds of Ukrainian refugees, laden with what few possessions they can carry, I remember clinging to my mother as we waited to be deported, not knowing where we were going or what awaited us. When I hear about the barbarity of Russian soldiers towards civilians in Ukrainian towns and villages, I remember the unspeakable cruelty that seized Europe when I was a child in the 1940s. My heart is warmed by the kindness and compassion shown by people across the UK, where tens of thousands have offered their homes to Ukrainian families. This public generosity has not been matched by the UK government, with the clumsy bureaucratic obstacles that it puts in the way. But that is not the worst thing. In its current form, the Nationality and Borders Bill means that refugees like me, who are forced to take irregular routes to safety in the UK, will in future face up to four years in prison. The bill, as both the UN and senior British judges have repeatedly pointed out, is in flagrant breach of the Refugee Convention, which Britain helped to shape. The 1951 Refugee Convention was adopted in the wake of the Holocaust to ensure that never again would those fleeing war, torture or persecution be denied protection for lacking the correct documents. A former Supreme Court justice has rightly dubbed the Nationality and Borders Bill a ""grotesque"" piece of legislation. The Lords have voted key provisions down, but Boris Johnson seems determined to pay no heed to their concerns. This government can and must do better, when the Lords amendments come back to the House of Commons on Wednesday. This bill is an affront to the long tradition of providing sanctuary to people in need that has made our country great. I know from my own experience that those who are given a chance will show only gratitude, as so many did when escaping from the Nazis. The generosity of spirit at that time showed that Britain was great. Tearing up our international commitments does the very opposite.

2979,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,12/4/2022,678 words,Via AP news wire,Czechs provide free shooting training for local Ukrainians," Of the first four shots Olha Dembitska fired from an AK-47 assault rifle in her life, one hit the target.  ""It's pretty difficult the first time,"" the 22-year-old Ukrainian woman acknowledged. On this occasion, the target was the shape of a human body at a shooting range in the Czech Republic. Next time, it might be for real, in Ukraine, and the target could be one of the Russian troops who have invaded her homeland. Dembitska is one of at least 130 men and women who have so far undergone free-of-charge training for Ukrainians living in the Czech Republic who want to learn how to fight the aggressor. ""I might return to Ukraine if they need me,"" she said. Almost none of the participants had any experience with weapons before war struck their homeland. Since Russia launched its brutal attack, Ukrainians from all parts of the country and elsewhere have been arriving in the Czech Republic's second-largest city, Brno , attracted by courses designed to teach them essentials and skills to safely handle lethal rifles while being able to inflict damage on their enemy. Beside learning to shoot, the courses give them the basics about guns, movement around the battlefield and a lesson in providing first aid, something that can save lives if they're mobilized by their embattled country or decide to return home as volunteers to join the Ukrainian army. They are all motivated. ""It's horrible,"" Dembitska said about the situation in her homeland. She gets her news from social media and from phone calls with a friend based in the southern city of Kherson , seized by Russian troops in the early stages of the invasion. ""She tells me everything. They haven't received humanitarian aid. It's a horror what the Russian soldiers are doing, I'm sick of it."" Michal Ratajsky, the owner of CS Solutions, a security company that offers the training program at its base on the outskirts of Brno, located some 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague , called it ""our contribution to the help for Ukrainians."" ""We view it as a morale boost we're giving them in this situation, an effort to show we're supporting them and that we will do for them what we can at the given moment,"" Ratajsky said. ""That was our motivation and goal."" A crowdfunding campaign helped secure enough money for the ammunition, while his company provides the rest, including experienced instructors, weapons and the shooting range. Ratajsky said the brief, three-hour training can't do miracles but should be enough to introduce the Ukrainians to new, unfamiliar skills. ""We know that we don't make soldiers of them in those three hours,"" he said. ""We try to do the maximum for them in the time, with the focus on their safety."" Some of the participants have returned for repeated lessons. Some have come from as far away as Vienna. in neighboring Austria. Some took the course on their way back to Ukraine from Western Europe, Ratajsky said. He said the Ukrainians are united by anger about the Russian aggression, and determined to end it. ""They take it seriously and want to do something about it."" He said that because some 80% percent of troop losses in a war like the one in Ukraine are caused by artillery and missiles, a sense of self-preservation and knowledge of first aid might be more useful for survival than shooting. ""We're aware of the limits of what we can get them ready for and make no secret of it,"" Ratajsky said. Yehor Nechyporenko, 38, who had traveled some 260 kilometers (160 miles) from the town of Mlada Boleslav to Brno for the second time said he is helping Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in the Czech Republic but wants to be ready to go back home to fight. ""It's very useful for me,"" he said of the training. ""I really like it. I need to learn those things because I didn't do military service."" Nechyporenko said he was sure the Russians have no chance of taking the entire country. ""I think the war will be over in a couple of months,"" he said. ""And if we see we're losing, we'll all travel home."" ___ Follow the AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",Broadsheet,0

Vasyl and Marina Prishchak and their three daughters Maria, 16, Sofia, 10, and Kseniia, 5, travelled from their home in Kyiv to Oahu for a long-awaited holiday visiting their friends Borys and Beata Markin in the middle of February. But, just days into their three-week trip, their dream holiday turned to heartbreak as Russia declared war on Ukraine and they found themselves watching from afar as their home country came under attack. More than one month on, with the planned vacation now over, they remain stuck in the US not knowing if their home close to a Ukrainian military base is even still standing or if they will ever be able to return home. Their cosmetics company has been forced to close and access to their finances has been cut off, according to the Associated Press. The canoe paddling community has rallied around the family in their time of need, with one local homeowner giving them a cottage to stay rent-free for as long as they need in Kaneohe. Thousands of dollars have been raised in donations to support the displaced family, with a GoFundMe organised by one local reaching more than $33,000 on Thursday. Meanwhile, others are helping them in other ways, such as supporting them with immigration questions as they apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). In early March, President Joe Biden announced he was granting TPS to Ukrainians fleeing from the war, enabling Ukrainians to stay and work legally in the US for 18 months. An estimated 75,000 people will be shielded from deportation back to the war zone because of this rule. The Prishchaks said they are thankful for the outpouring of support they have received from the local community in the US.  Mr Prishchak, who has known Mr Markin for three decades, told AP that ""this vacation changed our life"". ""We don't know how we return to Ukraine and what we will do, we will begin from zero, from scratch,"" he said. He said that he feels guilty being on a beautiful island away from his home while his fellow Ukrainian men are unable to leave the country and are now fighting on the frontline. ""It's a really terrible feeling that eats away at you from inside when you understand that all your close relatives are now in a very complicated situation,"" he said.  ""And there's no way you can help them stop this absolute insanity. It's a feeling that simply eats you up inside, you could say.  ""A horrible sensation, an inner guilt that I'm here and not there."" Ms Markin, who has lived with her Ukrainian husband in Hawaii for eight years, said she sees it as ""our responsibility to make sure they are okay here"" as they ""have nowhere to go"". Charlotte Johnson, an Oahu resident who set up the GoFundMe, called on her fellow Americans to ""bring hope to their lives by sharing our aloha"". ""Sadly, we can't help all the Ukrainians, but we can help this family of five,"" she wrote on the fundraising page. ""None of us can even imagine going on a vacation only to find the life left no longer exists."" She added: ""Even the smallest donation will make a difference. To a country half a world away, these five Ukrainians are our touchpoint.  ""Today we can help this Ukrainian family who took a vacation and will never return to the home they knew."" Last week, on the one-month anniversary of the day the war began, Mr Biden unveiled plans to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and other refugees fleeing the country into the US. He also pledged to provide $1bn in humanitarian assistance to help with the rising humanitarian crisis as more than 4 million refugees have now left their homes in Ukraine. It's a move that comes after pressure was mounting on the US from European counterparts to do more to support Ukrainian refugees.",Broadsheet,1
2987,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,9/2/2023,818 words,Editorial,This is the moment to give the Ukrainians the tools to finish the job,"It is entirely fitting, as well as a signal honour, that Volodymyr Zelensky ’s second visit abroad since Russia invaded his countryshould be to the UK. America’s financial, technological and military assistance has naturally dwarfed other contributions, but Britain has led in supplying intelligence and weaponry and was one of the first powers to respond to Kyiv’s cries for help when the Russians came rolling over the border.  It would be churlish to deny the role played in that effort by Boris Johnson and Ben Wallace , in particular, and the way, through example, they galvanised the West’s response a year ago and more, when others either dismissed the possibility of Russian aggression, blamed Nato for “poking the Russian bear” or writing off Ukraine’s chances of surviving more than a few weeks. His leadership in that period was one of the few things Mr Johnson may count as an unalloyed success; any personal political capital he extracts from it was and is a price worth paying. The policy has been continued by Mr Johnson’s successors and enjoyed cross-party and broad national support. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees have been made welcome in British homes, though more can always be done. Most recently, that commitment has been demonstrated once again in the early pledge of Challenger 2 battle tanks, and, now, in the training Ukrainian pilots in modern Western fighter jets. The Challenger tank initiative, with the promise of US Abrams tanks, succeeded in making the German government budge and relax its restrictions on the export of its Leopard tanks. President Zelensky was generous in his thanks for British support. But the UK, the West and the free world as whole has much cause to thank President Zelensky and the brave Ukrainian people. The miseries and murders they have suffered in the past year are scarcely comprehensible. Defeated time and again on the battlefield, driven back and humiliated, Vladimir Putin’s forces have turned to indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets and the use of lawless, merciless Wagner Group mercenaries to prevent a total rout. He treats the lives of Russian soldiers, including ethnic minorities, as worthless cannon fodder. Badly-led and poorly equipped, they only have the edge on the Ukrainians in sheer numbers. Soon, they will seek to make numbers count, and a fresh Russian offensive will come. The Kremlin has been regrouping. There is talk ofperhaps 500,000 troops being amassed. The Russians have some more modern tanks of their own, the T90s. They will be making more drones. They will continue to target civilian populations. They are proving more adept at evading sanctions and exporting oil: China and India have been too helpful to Moscow. So, Ukraine will need even more help in the coming months. After London, Mr Zelensky travelled to Paris, where he met with Macron and Scholz. He will then go to Brussels, where he is assured of another warm welcome. Essentially, though Mr Zelensky also needs to focus on an uncertain Berlin. For historic and industrial reasons, Germany has been understandably reluctant to become embroiled in the Ukraine conflict. It has paid a heavier price than most, in inflation and energy sanctions, but in the end Germany has done the right thing.  As the leading European industrial power, it now needs to support the Western effort still further, diplomatically and practically. That means fighter jets – from the UK, the rest of Europe, the US and allies across the globe. That is what Mr Zelensky has travelled West to secure: The inscription on the Ukrainian fighter pilot’s helmet presented to Speaker Hoyle reads “combat aircraft for Ukraine, wings for freedom.” The message is clear. Air power is the next task, because the usefulness of the vast quantity of munitions, missile systems, artillery, tanks and armoured vehicles depends in part on adequate control of the skies. It is the one area where Ukraine remains at a relative technological disadvantage, and an absolute numerical one. Air power is the final element in the armoury that will be needed to push the Russians out of Ukraine and defeat them. As President Zelensky said, “victory will change the world”. When this conflict is resolved, Russia can then be rehabilitated, live in peace with this neighbours, rebuild its economy and democratic institutions, and be treated with due respect in the community of nations. When that happens, the whole world will be a safer place – but especially Europe. That is the prize that awaits. This is a critical moment. One year ago, on the eve of invasion, few would have given the Ukrainians much chance of resisting, let alone actually beating the Russians. Now it is an entirely realistic ambition. This is the moment, to borrow the Churchillian phrase, to give the Ukrainians the tools to finish the job. We cannot allow weakness or hesitation to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.",Broadsheet,0

So when refugees began fleeing war-torn Ukraine, she was always going to help. Sitting around the large wooden table in the 87-year-old's Dublin home are Viktoria Kasianenko, 39, who was driven with her four-year-old daughter Barbara Yevlakhova and step-daughter Anna Yevlakhova, 32, to join her husband Yury, 58, in Dublin. The five-day journey, which saw them travel from badly-hit Kharkiv to Lviv and then onto Poland , has become all too familiar in recent weeks as more than 7,000 refugees from embattled Ukraine arrive in the Republic of Ireland.  Viktoria, Barbara and Anna came to Dublin to join Yury, a watchmaker who has worked for Mrs McDonagh's son in the city centre since last September. We are very grateful to the family for hosting us now in Ireland. We can feel the support from everyone, from all the family members Viktoria Kasianenko But, in doing so, family and friends - including Viktoria's father - have been left behind. ""From the first days, the bombs were falling and we heard the shooting,"" Viktoria told PA news agency. Like thousands of others, the trio were forced to hide in basements as soon as sirens blared to announce incoming Russian shelling. ""We were like this for a few days,"" she said through a translator. ""One morning, we woke up and we decided... we were in the basement and we decided we cannot do it anymore."" The three went to a train station to escape but found it ""completely full"". Viktoria said: ""We didn't manage to get on the train, and then we decided we're going to sleep on the train station and just to find any way to get out of there."" From Poland, a Scottish woman criss-crossing the continent to help Ukrainian refugees drove them all the way to Ireland. While they are now safe, Viktoria and Anna struggle to describe the fear they have for their country. ""First of all, of course we are happy that they are now in a safe place. And we are very grateful to the family for hosting us now in Ireland. We can feel the support from everyone, from all the family members,"" Viktoria said. ""We are sad and there's no words can explain how we feel because we left absolutely everything there. ""Nobody knows what to expect and when we going be able to move back. ""Of course, it's the first and the main wish to go back to Ukraine and to see our family and friends and relatives. But nobody knows what to expect."" Barbara, who is not yet in school, is adjusting to her new surroundings. She messed around with the keys of Mrs McDonagh's piano while her mother talked. Viktoria thinks the youngster has become a decade older since the war began on February 24. ""She understands everything and she watches the news. She understands what it going on and why we left,"" she said. The family are grateful to Ireland for the help and say the Government is doing all it can. While Anna and Viktoria say they want to work and somewhere to live, the next few weeks are full of uncertainty. ""In the near future, we would like to be able to rent our own apartments so we will not be sitting on the neck of people,"" Viktoria says. The plan is to create a ""normal life"" in Ireland - and to be ready to return to Ukraine whenever it is safe. For Mrs McDonagh, she is in no rush to see her guests leave. The family speak no English and Mrs McDonagh no Ukrainian, so they communicate using an app. The Dubliner has six children, 17 grandchildren and in years gone by hosted French and Spanish students. Born in 1935, she has now seen two wars in Europe. But to her, there is nothing difficult about taking in a family - even at her age. ""It's grand,"" she says. ""The way I think of it, if my children were over there, wouldn't you love somebody to mind them?"" Mrs McDonagh is proud to be Irish - and prouder still of the country's response to the crisis. ""I love our Taoiseach (Micheal Martin) and (Tanaiste) Leo Varadkar."" ""I think we're a charitable country. ""It is a great country. Best country in the world, Ireland.""",Broadsheet,1

The Home Secretary , who has come under intense political pressure from MPs across the Commons to do more to allow Ukrainian refugees to reach the UK, insisted she was taking action to open safe routes. She told MPs she was following the ""strongest security advice"" as she rejected the call to scrap the need for visas. ""Over the weekend I have seen members of this House calling for full visa waivers for all Ukrainians,"" Ms Patel said. ""Security and biometric checks are a fundamental part of our visa approval process worldwide and will continue, as they did for the evacuation of people from Afghanistan. ""That is vital to keep British citizens safe and to ensure that we are helping those in genuine need, particularly as Russian troops are now infiltrating Ukraine and merging into Ukrainian forces. ""Intelligence reports also state the presence of extremist groups and organisations who threaten the region but also our domestic homeland. ""We know all too well what Putin's Russia is willing to do, even on our soil, as we saw through the Salisbury attack."" The Home Secretary said the first phase of the ""bespoke humanitarian route"" being created for Ukrainians to enter the UK would allow around 100,000 people to come to ""seek sanctuary"". The Government has already announced measures allowing people who are settled in the UK to be able to bring their Ukrainian immediate family members to join them. ""Where family members of British nationals do not meet the usual eligibility criteria, but pass security checks, UK visas and immigration will give them the permission to enter the UK outside the rules for 12 months and is prioritising all applications,"" Ms Patel said. ""Giving British nationals and any person settled in the UK the ability to bring over their immediate Ukrainian family members."" The Home Secretary also set out plans to tighten the Nationality and Borders Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. The moves could make it harder for Russians to obtain visas to enter the UK. The legislation allows Ms Patel to suspend visas entirely, impose a £190 surcharge on applications to come to the UK or increase visa processing times. Currently that power is limited to countries that refuse to co-operate with the return of their nationals but Ms Patel said the powers would be extended to cover countries that have ""taken significant steps which threaten international peace and security"". Ms Patel's comments in the Commons came after senior Tory MPs urged Boris Johnson to do more to take in Ukrainians. Former Cabinet ministers Sir Robert Buckland, Jeremy Hunt, Damian Green and Matt Hancock were among the MPs to put their names to the letter calling for a ""flexible and pragmatic approach"" to allow Ukrainians to seek temporary refuge in the UK.

This should not be business as usual, we need sincere and immediate support for the Ukrainian people. ""The United Kingdom cannot flag or fail, our message must be clear: Ukrainian victims of war seeking refuge are welcome."" Opposition figures criticised Ms Patel's ""chaotic"" response to the crisis. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""The Home Secretary has just said she is announcing a bespoke humanitarian route but it's extremely unclear from what she's said what the details actually are or who it will apply to."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael said: ""Ukrainians are fleeing for their lives. ""They deserve far better than just more spin and confusion from our Government.

3029,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,17/5/2022,822 words,Via AP news wire,Greek's leader tells Congress democracy is tested by Russia,"Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis delivered an address Tuesday to a joint meeting of Congress, highlighting democratic values as NATO allies confront Russian aggression in Ukraine. Mitsotakis told lawmakers from the House and Senate that their shared values ""are once again being tested."" ""Our shared belief in freedom over tyranny, in democracy over authoritarianism, in the fundamental importance of respect for the rule of law over war and anarchy,"" he said to applause. Flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Mitsotakis was in Washington this week to mark a COVID-delayed commemoration of the bicentennial of the start of the Greek War of Independence that led to the ouster of the Ottoman Empire. His trip is aimed at reinforcing his country's strong energy and defense cooperation with the United States at a time of global unrest. In inviting him to make the address, Pelosi noted the ""unshakable bond"" between the two countries as the U.S. founders drew on the ancient Greek ideals of liberty and democracy. ""Our nations are key allies on the world stage,"" Pelosi said.  ""As our world faces a pivotal moment in the fight between the forces of democracy and autocracy, the transatlantic alliance remains vital to the future of freedom in the world,"" she said. But the celebratory moment was shadowed by the most significant fighting on the continent since World War II, and as Biden seeks to keep the West unified as it pressures Russia to end the war.  The Mitsotakis government has been outspoken in its criticism of the Russian invasion, now in its 12th week. The war in Ukraine, however, has also unsettled Greek policymakers as a possible source of wider regional instability and an opportunity for neighboring Turkey to seek diplomatic leverage from its major western allies.  President Joe Biden welcomed Mitsotakis to the White House on Monday and thanked for his country's ""moral leadership"" in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the two held talks about the ongoing conflict.  Biden praised Greece for showing ""moral clarity"" by quickly imposing sanctions against Russia following the Feb. 24 invasion, providing Kyiv with military assistance and taking in Ukrainian refugees fleeing the conflict. ""We're helping Ukrainians say no to Russian aggression,"" Biden said. ""And we're saying no to tyranny, to the idea that autocracies will outpace democracies in the 21st century, because that's what is at stake here in my view."" As Europe looks to wean itself off Russian energy, Mitsotakis has pushed the idea of Greece becoming an energy hub that can bring gas, as well as renewable energies, produced in southwest Asia, the Middle East and Africa to eastern Europe. ""Greece plans to play an important role as a gateway for electricity produced from cheap, renewable sources,"" Mitsotakis said. A new Greece-to-Bulgaria pipeline - built during the COVID-19 pandemic, tested and due to start commercial operation in June - is slated to bring large volumes of gas flow between the two countries in both directions to generate electricity, fuel industry and heat homes. The new pipeline connection, called the Gas Interconnector Greece-Bulgaria, will give Bulgaria access to ports in neighboring Greece that are importing liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and also will bring gas from Azerbaijan through a new pipeline system that ends in Italy. Russia announced last month it was cutting off natural gas exports to Bulgaria and Poland over the countries' refusal to pay in rubles. Greece, a fellow NATO nation, last week formally extended its bilateral military agreement with the United States for five years, replacing an annual review of the deal that grants the U.S. military access to three bases in mainland Greece as well as the American naval presence on the island of Crete. Mitsotakis has expressed support for Finland and Sweden seeking membership in the NATO defense alliance, a development welcomed by much of the 30-nation group with the notable exception of Tukey, which remains locked in a decades-old dispute with Greece on sea boundaries and mineral rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Mitsotakis, in an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Monday, expressed optimism that Turkey, in the end, won't hold up Finland and Sweden's bid to join NATO and addressed speculation that Erdogan might use the moment to win concessions from the Biden administration on weapons sales or other matters. ""This is not really the right time to use a NATO membership (application) by these two countries to bargain"" for other issues, he said. In addition to his address to Congress, Mitsotakis is scheduled Tuesday to be honored at a luncheon hosted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and will meet with members of the Congressional Caucus on Hellenic Issues and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

3044,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,5/4/2022,725 words,Via AP news wire,Harvard students' site helping Ukraine refugees find housing," Two Harvard University freshmen have launched a website designed to connect people fleeing Ukraine to those in safer countries willing to take them in - and it's generating offers of help and housing worldwide. Moved by the plight of Ukrainian refugees desperate to escape Russian bombardment across the former Soviet republic, Marco Burstein, 18, of Los Angeles , and Avi Schiffman, 19, of Seattle , used their coding skills to create UkraineTakeShelter.com over three frenzied days in early March. Since then, more than 18,000 prospective hosts have signed up on the site to offer assistance to refugees seeking matches with hosts in their preferred or convenient locations. On a recent day, Burstein and Schiffman logged 800,000 users. ""We've heard all sorts of amazing stories of hosts and refugees getting connected all over the world,"" Burstein said in an interview on the Harvard campus. ""We have hosts in almost any country you can imagine from Hungary and Romania and Poland to Canada to Australia. And we've been really blown away by the response."" Five weeks into the invasion that has left thousands dead on both sides, the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country topped a staggering 4 million, half of them children, according to the United Nations. Schiffman, who's been taking a semester off to work on several projects, said from Miami he was inspired to use his internet activism to help after attending a pro-Ukraine rally in San Diego. ""I felt that I could really do something on a more global scale here,"" he said. ""Ukraine Take Shelter puts the power back into the hands of the refugee ... they're able to take the initiative and find the listings and get in contact with hosts by themselves instead of having to freeze on a curb in Eastern Europe in the wintertime."" Among those who have taken in refugees through the website is Rickard Mijarov, a resident of the southwestern Swedish city of Linkoping who's sharing his home with 45-year-old Ukrainian evacuee Oksana Frantseva, her 18-year-old daughter and their cat. Mijarov and his wife signed up at an embassy indicating they'd help, but then stumbled upon the Harvard students' site and registered there as well. ""The next morning, I had a message from Oksana asking if we had place for them,"" he said in an interview via Zoom. ""It became reality quite fast."" ""I was surprised how quickly Rickard answered to me,"" Frantseva said in halting English. Five days later, she, her daughter and their pet were at the front door. Burstein and Schiffman designed the platform with combat refugees' particular concerns in mind. They worked to make it as easy to use as possible so someone in immediate danger can enter their location and see the offers of help that are closest to them. On the hosting side, they also gave prospective hosts the opportunity to indicate what languages they speak; how many refugees they can accommodate; and any restrictions on taking in young children or pets. To help avoid human trafficking and other hazards that vulnerable refugees face, the platform encourages evacuees to ask hosts to provide their full names and social media profiles, and request a video call to show what accommodations they're offering. ""We know that this is potentially a dangerous situation, so we have a lot of steps in place to ensure the protection of our refugees,"" Burstein said. ""We have a detailed guide that we give to all refugees to help them verify the host that they're talking to - make sure that the person that they may be speaking with on the phone is the same one that they're meeting up with in person."" The two students say they're trying to arrange a meeting with officials from the U.N. refugee agency, and they are also looking to work with Airbnb, Vrbo and other online vacation rental companies. So far, they've borne all the expenses - a hardship for college students - for web hosting and Google Translate costs. But they're determined to continue as long as possible and are looking into registering as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit so they can apply for grants. Back in Sweden, Mijarov admits it was a bit unnerving to open his home, but he has no regrets. ""It's the first time we are doing something like this,"" he said, seated next to Frantseva. ""But they're very nice people. So, yeah, going along well."" ___ Follow Rodrique Ngowi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ngowi",Broadsheet,1

Addressing an EU leaders' summit in Brussels via videolink, the wartime leader praised Poland and the three Baltic nations - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - for their full-on support since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. When it came to Ireland, though, Mr Zelensky was not so sure. ""Lithuania stands for us. Latvia stands for us. Estonia stands for us. Poland stands for us,"" he told his European counterparts. ""Luxembourg - we understand each other. Cyprus - I really believe you are with us. Italy - thank you for your support! Spain - we'll find common ground. Belgium - we will find arguments. Austria, together with Ukrainians, it is an opportunity for you. I'm sure of it."" Then he added: ""Ireland - well, almost.""  There was no explanation given for what appeared to be criticism of the Republic of Ireland and the help it has offered to Ukraine, leaving many bemused.  But asked about the remarks on Friday -the second day of European Council meeting -Mr Martin played down their conviction, insisting he did not agree that Ireland had been ""singled out"". ""I wouldn't have taken the same slant as some may be taking from it,"" he told reporters. ""[Mr Zelensky] was actually talking in terms of the European perspective."" The taoiseach went further, saying his conversations with the Ukrainian president Zelensky had so far been good and positive. ""I spoke to him last week and he was very strongly in praise of the Irish contribution, both from a humanitarian perspective, in terms of our clear support for Ukraine's application to join the EU, and he thanked me personally for my own personal commitment to that."" And Mr Martin added: ""I'm not going to surmise in terms of whatever particular take you would take from the use of the word 'almost' or 'practically' - and I wouldn't overstate that, to be frank."" Ireland, while fully backing the Ukrainian push for EU membership, has not abandoned its position of military neutrality in the face of the Russian assault. ""Obviously we're a militarily neutral country, but we explained that we facilitated the EU peace facility which has been of enormous support to the Ukrainian people,"" he said on Friday.  As well as committing millions of euros in non-lethal aid to Ukraine, Ireland has also taken in more than 10,000 Ukrainian refugees, with thousands more expected to arrive after Mr Martin's government removed any need for visas.

""These are powerful steps, but it was a little late,"" he said. ""Because if it had been preventative, Russia would not have gone to war. At least, no-one knows for sure. There was a chance."" Citing his country's bid to join the EU, Mr Zelensky also urged European leaders not to delay. ""Here I ask you, do not delay. Please. For us this is a chance."" EU officials have so far resisted the call to accelerate the accession of Ukraine to the bloc, with German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock stressing last month that joining the 27-nation group is not something that can be done in a couple of months.

Armed forces minister James Heappey said on Friday the early-morning attack on the city that has swelled with people sheltering from elsewhere in Ukraine showed Russia was broadening its strikes. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said several missiles hit a facility for repairing military planes near the city's international airport and also damaged a bus repair site. Shelling around the capital of Kyiv also continued as the number of refugees estimated to have fled exceeded 3.4 million. In other developments: - Ofcom revoked Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT's UK licence with immediate effect after the regulator said it was not ""fit and proper"". - Russia was accused of ""dirty tricks"" after two Cabinet ministers including Defence Secretary Ben Wallace were targeted with hoax calls from an impostor posing as Ukraine's prime minister. - More than 150,000 people have registered interest in the UK's Homes for Ukraine scheme to house Ukrainian refugees. Mr Heappey said indiscriminate shelling on cities were ""very probably"" war crimes and said the Russian President bears the ultimate ""culpability"" for atrocities. ""The areas of Ukrainian territory that have been taken by the Russians haven't changed for a week or so. The Russians are way behind in their plan; they are failing to achieve their military objectives and that may be some cause for optimism,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

No causalities were immediately reported in the strikes on Lviv, which has had its population swelled by some 200,000 people seeking refuge from attacks across Ukraine. Mr Heappey said that ""it's very much a part of war that you would go after each others' supply lines but clearly the airstrike on an airbase in western Ukraine last week and strikes on to Lviv airport last night show that the Russians are start going after Ukrainian depth as well"". An intelligence update from the Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces were continuing to ""frustrate"" Moscow's attempt to encircle cities despite heavy shelling. ""Russian forces have made minimal progress this week,"" it added. Western officials have described the advance on Kyiv as remaining ""bogged down"" amid questions over whether Moscow would still mount an assault on the city, which had been its main objective. ""An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well-prepared as Kyiv with really determined and committed defenders would be a very costly business,"" one official said. ""I think there comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties."" There was fresh outrage at the alleged war crimes being committed under Mr Putin after an attack on a theatre in Mariupol where hundreds of civilians were said to have sheltered. Mr Heappey warned that ""every single person"" in the military chain of command could be prosecuted for war crimes as he hit out at the ""barbaric tactic"" of trying to destroy a city forces have been unable to seize militarily. ""The evidence being gathered points very much towards war crimes being committed in Ukraine. The culpability for war crimes sits absolutely with the leader of the Russian government, the man who decided to do all of this in the first place,"" he told Sky News. ""It is not just Putin who ends up being responsible for war crimes as and when the evidence is gathered and people are held to account. ""They too are involved in the prosecution or war crimes in Ukraine. This is a stain on the Russian nation."" He said the UK was training Ukrainians to use the Starstreak anti-aircraft missile system that Britain is supplying and which will arrive in the country ""imminently"".

Rachel's advice to anyone considering taking a refugee into their home is simple: ""A warm welcome goes a long way."" She continues: ""We just try and give them a warm, calm welcome.

The Poultons are already housing a number of unaccompanied child refugees at the moment, but have a spare room that they are hoping to offer to a Ukrainian family.

She often writes a welcome card for her guests when they arrive. ""Those little things can mean more than we realise,"" Ms Poulton said. ""There was one time when a young man was moving on, having been with us for a couple of years. He was quite a tough, cool guy, and I was helping him pack, and he put the little card in. I was so surprised he still had it. He said that it had been really important to him when he first came, so he had kept it."" The best bit about sheltering refugees is being there when good things happen in their lives, she said. ""Last night we went out to celebrate the birthday of one of the refugees who used to live here, and it was such a joyful evening,"" Rachel added. ""It's also a joy to see people learn to drive, achieve at school, and learn new skills like the piano and swimming."" Her two young children, who are still at home, have also learnt to get along well with their new housemates. But as well as the positives, the people Rachel and Nigel take in have experienced a lot of trauma before they stay with them. ""They have dealt with so much on their journeys to the UK, in the countries that they come from, and also in the ongoing news they see through their mobiles. This will be true of Ukrainians too. They will experience ongoing trauma when they look at the footage and keep up with the bad news."" She is worried that many Ukrainians fleeing the war will see Britain as too difficult to get to, too slow at processing documentation, and too far away. She also has concerns about how they will be transported from Ukraine or the Polish border to the homes in Britain that are keen to accept them. Levelling up secretary Michael Gove told MPs that Ukrainians with no family links would be allowed to come to the UK under the new scheme, and that there would be ""no limit"" to the number who can benefit. They will have to have a ""sponsor"" in the UK who is willing to provide them with a home for a minimum of six months. ""If you don't know anyone who you wish to sponsor, you may wish to get in touch with charities, faith groups, or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals,"" the government guidance said. Some 1.4 million children have now fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, meaning nearly one child a second has become a refugee, the UN said yesterday.",Broadsheet,1
3090,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,27/7/2022,824 words,Andrew Naughtie,"Voices: ‘Hello Stoke, this is Paris calling’: Can Eurovision succeed where levelling up is failing?","For Britain to come second to Ukraine at Eurovision 2021 was no mean feat. It also put an end to one of the silliest myths about our dismal performance in recent years: that it’s somehow All About Us. By combining a decent enough song with a genuinely charismatic performance and an existing online fanbase, Sam Ryder proved we can still win this thing. Let this put an end to the sanctimonious idea that Britain was losing out year after year at Eurovision because of Brexit, or because of fatigue at our warmongering colonial arrogance, or something – a conceit every bit as Anglocentric as the idea that we somehow deserve to win. The viewing public of Europe and beyond simply are not fixated on passing sombre judgement on us and our politics, and it’s self-aggrandising of us to think so. For years, we sent Eurovision anything but our best, and we got the points we deserved (or rather, we never got the ones we didn’t deserve). Now, by taking on the mantle of hosting Eurovision while Ukraine suffers a continued pounding by the inept but still murderous Russian army, we have the chance to show our solidarity. Unfortunately, we’ll also be calling attention to ourselves at the worst possible time to show off. Hosting Eurovision isn’t just expensive; it’s also very exposing. The hosts can screw everything up spectacularly. Coming up with something to fill the excruciatingly long gap during the voting is almost as challenging as pulling off an Olympic opening ceremony – but without anything like the budget or lead time. And overshadowing it all is the task of putting on your best national face. So, where’s it going to be? Glasgow and Manchester, of course, are straight out of the gate as the top contenders. Classic British thinking: for all that truly great music, live and recorded, emanates from every corner of the union, there isn’t a long list of non-London cities that outsiders associate with both inclusive fun and musical excellence. The go-to stand-ins for the entire North and the whole of Scotland are, as ever, the thunderingly obvious choices. Neither is the worst possible option, self-image wise, but the fact that they’re leading the pack already does signal a lack of imagination. Maybe we could be a bit more honest and invite this international circus deeper into the heartland. We could even think of it as an unexpected boost for the depleted levelling-up agenda: yes, HS2 has been hacked to its bones and the North has now fallen behind the English public spending average , but there’s always the option of bringing Eurovision to Victoria Hall in Stoke-on-Trent or the Northern Echo arena in Darlington. And given the condition of the country and the peeved mood of the mythical 2019 Red Wall voter, maybe it would behove everyone involved to think even bigger – or rather, smaller. The ultimate example was set by Ireland in 1993, when an equestrian facility operator had the chutzpah to write in to RTÉ and pitch them on the idea of hosting the international contest in the County Cork town of Millstreet. Its nearby Green Glens Arena could seat nearly two-and-a-half times the population of the town, and the national broadcaster went for it.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here  So if we’re serious about leaving no one behind, about building the “Global Britain” we were promised instead of a shrivelled remnant fast acquiring a reputation for complacent cruelty and broken promises, why not go the whole hog and point Eurovision’s hundreds of millions of viewers at a part of the country now condemned as “left behind”? Think a funding-deprived Victorian town hall, or the sort of seaside conference centre usually reserved for glum political party conferences. Or maybe we could go the whole hog and host it somewhere truly off the radar – a Working Men’s Club in Grimethorpe , perhaps, or the Athletic Sports Club in Mexborough.  After all, in the face of nonexistent growth and excruciating living costs, patronising grand gestures with no promise of delivery are apparently all we have left to offer. So for Eurovision to swoop in with a few days’ worth of big money (much of it from EU countries) before vanishing again and leaving nothing behind would fit the spirit of the times just perfectly. Funnily enough, Millstreet’s Green Glens has since served a new purpose as temporary accommodation for Ukrainian refugees. Popular in Ukraine though Boris Johnson might still be, it’s hard to imagine a government led by him or his emotionally jaundiced party giving up even a modest privately owned rural events venue to shelter people fleeing a despicably violent conflict. Hosting the Eurovision Song Contest on Mariupol’s behalf will have to do.",Broadsheet,0

A trio of vehicles f illed with drones, military equipment and medical supplies recently arrived in Ukraine – to help them defend against Russia 's invasion – from Wales because of that bond. One of the drivers was Wayne Thomas, who experienced the strike as a young miner and now, at 63, is vice-president of the UK National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Six volunteers set off with two Mitsubishi SUVs and a Volkswagen “Transporter” from Pontypridd in Wales, where the donated vehicles and supplies had been gathered at a NUM property. They overnighted in Folkestone and next day went by train under the Channel to Calais and drove through France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland before crossing into Ukraine after four days. The other principal convoy organiser was Mick Antoniw, 69, Welsh Assembly member and Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution of the Welsh Government (Wales’s equivalent of attorney general). A former member of the British Labour Party’s national executive, Antoniw was helping to bring convoys of aid to Ukraine for the ninth time. This trip marked £1 million pounds worth of donations -15 vehicles plus various supplies -the group has sent to Ukraine since the full-scale war began on February 24, 2022. Antoniw made contacts in the NUM because the firm of solicitors he belonged to before becoming a full-time politician often represented the miners’ union. Another former miner and the “youngster” of the convoy at 35, was Carwyn Donovan, now an official of the Broadcast and Entertainments Union. The fourth driver was Jan Michaelis, 56, the technical director at the Welsh National Opera, who learned about the aid convoys from Donovan who represented the opera’s union members in negotiations while Michaelis sat on the management side of the table. The fifth was Roman Kozak, 69, who was born in Leicester, trained as a doctor at the Royal London Hospital and has lived in Canada since 1979.  Antoniw’s mother was Danish and his father, a refugee from Ukraine during the Second World War, as were both of Kozak’s parent. Both men have been interested in supporting Ukraine in various ways all their lives. Because both have been his friends from childhood, this reporter was invited to chronicle the convoy’s journey for The Independent. During the miners' strike of four decades ago, Ukraine was still a part of the Soviet Union and a delegation of miners, headed by an official called Mykhailo Volynets from Ukraine’s largest coal mining region in Donetsk arrived to show solidarity with British comrades. In 1989, Volynets rallied Ukrainian miners calling for independence from the USSR and when that came in 1991 he formed the Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Miners – which joined the broader movement for democracy sweeping his country. It played an important role in mass protests in 2004 and 2014. Following the full-scale 2022 invasion, the Ukrainian miners reached out to the NUM for help with vehicles and other supplies for the thousands of their members who had joined the Ukrainian military to defend their country. Thomas explained that the miners had become especially close with the Ukrainian miners.  “And so when we were asked in 2022 for assistance it was a case of not ‘should we help?’ but ‘yes, and what do you need?’ And the NUM immediately sent £20,000 to the miners in Pavlohrad,” says Thomas. Thomas has made five wartime trips to Ukraine. “The resolve of the Ukrainian people, all the people we’ve spoken to of all ages, is amazing. Their belief that their culture and country are worth fighting for leaves an enormous impression,” he says.  He adds that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had contributed much surplus medical and (non-lethal) military kit including night vision equipment, trench cooking equipment, warm clothing, boots, helmets, body armour and medicines. His daughter, Danielle Edwards, who has been involved with the army cadet force all her life – as a cadet and later as an instructor with the rank of major – has also helped enormously with the MoD’s goodwill. Antoniw said individual former members of Britain’s armed forces have been among the largest donors.  Donovan said he first became aware of Ukraine through Antoniw who he had come to know when Antoniw was the miners’ union’s solicitor solicitor. He had told Antoniw to call him if he ever needed help over in Ukraine. That’s what Antoniw did one summer Monday morning in 2022 and by the next Friday Donovan says he found himself as the co-driver of a vehicle heading on the first of his trips into Ukraine. He explains the connections that inspired the group: “First of all there’s that inexplicable bond that exists between miners whichever country, a will to help your colleagues.  He adds: “What first struck me was the Ukrainians’ sense of resolve, a sense of quiet determination, that Ukraine would not be destroyed. And Ukrainians have a sense of humour when faced with tremendous, real risks. I think that’s fairly similar to working underground.  “In all the times I’ve been out here [Ukraine], I’ve never seen anyone cry despite all the sorrow. People have told me they will cry because they’ve lost loved ones -but only after victory comes. I wish I was that strong.” One of the other drivers, Michaelis, says he spent a lot of time visiting relatives in communist East Berlin and felt the absence of free speech and saw how his family had to be cautious about how they acted and what they said. “That gave me an understanding of what an oppressive regime can do to people from very early on in my life.” He recognises Ukrainians face the same crackdown on freedom if they are occupied by Putin’s forces. “If Ukraine doesn’t manage to stop Russia now, Russia may well be in Poland next and if they are there they are only 20 minutes away from my hometown of Berlin. Ukraine is fighting the fight for Europe.” Kozak says that Ukrainians are living under conditions most of us can't even fathom. “I don’t think we can appreciate in the West, living in peace, the tension of an ongoing war with the risk of air attacks, bombing and shelling,"" he says. ""It has been valuable to experience what Ukrainians are going through."" He adds: “I’m very impressed by the attitude of Ukrainians -they realise the risks but don’t allow the war to stop their lives or prevent them doing simple things, like going out for a beer and enjoying life. That spirit to keep going.” Antoniw was born in England but fell in love with Wales and its culture when he studied law at Cardiff University.  He has worked hard to cultivate cultural links between Wales and Ukraine. Antoniw draws, as do Thomas and Donovan, comparisons between the suppression of the Welsh language and Moscow’s Russification program which threatened to eliminate the Ukrainian language.  Antoniw is proud Wales has welcomed 7,000 Ukrainian refugees, mainly women and children. Many of them have found homes in his constituency of Pontypridd. He has noticed on this trip a “gloom” among Ukrainians caused by the impasse in the US Congress that has led to a severe reduction of artillery ammunition and other supplies critical for Ukraine’s defence.  “I’ve noticed this time particularly concern but I don’t see less determination on the part of Ukrainians to carry on fighting,"" Antoniw says. "" But the concern is to what extent can you rely on Western promises to deliver? People are being killed because promised military supplies haven’t come.” He says he had faced criticism for spending so much time on aid for Ukraine, but responds that he uses his holiday time for the support work and “all volunteers pay for their own accommodation and food expenses so that every penny of donated money goes on aid.” The three vehicles were handed over in Kyiv to people who in turn were driving them to military units where PRUP union miners from Pavlohrad serve. Vitalyi Pyvovar, who picked up on of the vehicles, says some 5,000 of PRUP’s 25,000 miners are on the frontline at any time. About 400 members have been killed. Pyvovar says: “We have had a long relationship with the Welsh miners. Many years ago they were facing hard times [because of the 1984 strike] and my father’s generation tried to help them. Now, when Ukraine is afflicted by troubles, they are helping us.”",Broadsheet,0

The families of both British nationals are being supported, a spokesperson at the Foreign Office said. No further details were given. Sky News reported that the pair may have been volunteers fighting against Russian forces, but this has not been confirmed. In a statement the Foreign Office said: ""We can confirm that a British national has been killed in Ukraine and are supporting their family."" On the missing person, the spokesperson said: ""We are aware of a British national who is missing in Ukraine and are supporting their family. We are urgently seeking further information."" A small number of serving British personnel are believed to have gone absent without leave to join the resistance against the Russian invasion, while veterans and Britons without combat experience are thought to have also travelled to Ukraine. There was initially confusion on the Government's position after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss , in comments during an interview to the BBC on February 26, said she would ""absolutely"" support UK nationals who chose to fight for Ukraine. However, she later rowed back on those comments, insisting she had been ""expressing support for the Ukrainian cause"" in her remarks, and that there are ""better ways"" to contribute to the country's defence. Veterans minister Leo Docherty has previously written to armed forces charities to encourage those tempted to travel to the war zone to turn their efforts to helping the Ukrainian people from the UK. Meanwhile, the latest Government figures show that around a fifth of Ukrainian refugees who have been issued with visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have arrived in the UK. A total of 86,100 visas had been issued as of Wednesday under the Ukraine Family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship scheme, the Government said. But, as of Monday, just 27,100 Ukrainians had arrived in the UK, according to figures from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office. Overall, less than a third (31.4%) of those granted visas under both schemes have arrived in the UK. There are multiple cases where families are unable to travel to the UK because not all family members have received their permission to travel letters or visas. There has also been widespread concern about the length of time it has taken for visas to be issued to refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. A Government spokeswoman said: ""We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further."" We've constantly said that Russia should leave Ukraine sovereign territory so that hasn't changed Defence Secretary Ben Wallace Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said Britain and its allies need to help prise Russian forces out of Ukraine like ""a limpet off the rock"". Mr Wallace said the UK would continue to supply weapons to the government in Kyiv and was looking at the options for providing anti-ship missiles. The UK Ministry of Defence said despite the losses of the cruiser Moskva and the landing ship Saratov, Russia's Black Sea Fleet retained the ability to strike targets in Ukraine. In its latest intelligence assessment it said the Russian navy has around 20 vessels in the area, including submarines. Mr Wallace said it was vital that Ukraine, as a major grain producer, continued to have access to the Black Sea as an outlet for its exports. ""We have said we will source and supply, if we can, anti-ship missiles,"" he told Sky News. ""It's incredibly important that the grain that affects us all, the food prices, does get to get out of Ukraine, that the Russians can't control the Black Sea."" In a keynote speech on Wednesday, Ms Truss said the objective should be to drive Russia out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". Mr Wallace said it had always been the position of the international community that Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory since President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. However, he said there was ""a long way to go"" before the Ukrainians were able to reclaim the land lost in 2014. He said the Russians appeared to be preparing to dig in to the territory they seized in the east of the country in their latest invasion. ""We've constantly said that Russia should leave Ukraine sovereign territory so that hasn't changed,"" he said. ""I think it's certainly the case that Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got, sort of fortify and dig in, as he did in 2014, and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country of Ukraine and make it very hard for people to move them out of those fortified positions,"" he said. ""So I think it's really about, if we want this to not happen, we have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.""",Broadsheet,1

3139,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,8/3/2022,806 words,JENNY ECLAIR,How many of us would offer a home to a Ukraine family?,"Call me naive, but I genuinely didn't believe this could happen. Obviously, I knew there were ugly rumblings over Russia and the Ukraine, but I never thought that one man could inflict so much pain and chaos - while the rest of the world stood by and watched. ""Surely someone will kill him,"" sprang to mind, which is what a lot of people have been saying, but is ultimately a bad idea. Still, I can't help myself wondering, sometimes: ""Why can't someone simply assassinate Putin? Someone close, who pretends to be on his side and then betrays him and saves the world?"" In a film this would happen, and the assassin in question could be played by Voldymyr Zelensky, the heroic Ukranian leader who - already, in his own lifetime - has won Ukraine's Strictly Come Dancing and been the voice of the Ukrainian Paddington Bear. Beat that, Boris. Turns out, though, that in an emergency I am not capable of rational grown-up thought. Because I don't know enough about world politics or Nato, I find myself responding like a schoolgirl: ""Just kill him"" (to be honest, after seeing the footage of this catastrophic war, given the chance, I would do the job myself). It's a very odd feeling, seeing a deliberate manmade disaster unfold in real time as we go about our daily business. I think many of us thought that the worst we would see in our cozy little lives was the pandemic. Surely, once that was in retreat, we deserved many years of ease and contentment? After all, as a universe, we'd gone through something pretty traumatic together. Surely that gave us a shared experience and some kind of perspective on the world? I genuinely thought, post-Covid, that even if we struggled to get back on our feet financially we'd feel a sense of global optimism and dare to relax and have some fun - after all, the worst had happened and more of us had survived than we ever dared hope. Ha! ""How dare he, how dare he,"" I find myself muttering instead, my hatred intense - but utterly futile. Like many people, I can only take small doses of the news and much to my shame, I find that for whole swathes of the day I can blank out the entire situation, distracted by Wordle and the fact that I'm in the middle of filming a telly job which I love, while living on the 20th floor of a high-rise hotel in Manchester for the duration. Last time I was here, recording the same show, it was November 2020 - the city was in level 3 lockdown and the entire place was eerily deserted. Now, the puddles of post-Friday night puke are back on the Saturday morning pavements and once again the city is a thriving, raucous hub. People are dressed up and ready to party, Covid seems to be on the back foot and there's a celebratory air. Only now and then it catches you: how dare we have fun while the Ukrainians suffer? How can we go about our normal routines, running baths, boiling kettles and putting a wash on, while millions of people have seen their water and electricity cut off and their homes bombed? Less than two weeks ago, they were doing what we're doing: eating pizza, making telly shows and spending weekends throwing up on pavements. Now, women are giving birth in underground bunkers and the old sit huddled on makeshift seating, surrounded by their possessions, dazed by this cruellest turn of events. Apart from donating, what can we really do? Watching the generosity of the other European nations is humbling. They are stepping forward to offer shelter without hesitation. Ukrainian refugees are being met at railway stations in Hungary, while on other platforms, travellers lucky enough to live in other countries are arriving for their weekend city breaks. It's the same story in Germany, Poland and Moldova. How many of us in the UK would offer our homes up to a Ukrainian family? Our hearts say yes, but the reality is daunting and exhausting. If we're honest, most of us struggle to cope with our nearest and dearest for more than a few days over Christmas - massive props to anyone who opens their home to traumatised strangers without a shared language in common. The utter weirdness of this situation beggars belief. While all my sympathies lie with the people of the Ukraine, I can't help wondering how countless westernised Russians and their children must feel in this country, right now. It must be pretty weird to be completely accepted one day and feel like an utter pariah the next. How do the Ukrainians in this country deal with Russian workmates?

As the Kremlin wages war on their eastern European neighbour , Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said it was ""immoral"" to apply usual visa restrictions to Ukranians escaping war.  Priti Patel called her comments ""appalling misinformation"" and said ""the facts"" were in government guidance that she shared. The document showed a visa application fee is being waived for family members of Britons who live in Ukraine and Ukrainians in the UK are being given temporary concessions when their visa expires.  According to the latest estimates from the UN refugee agency, almost 116,000 have fled their homes - predominately to Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania - since Vladimir Putin declared war. Earlier this week The Independent reported that there is currently no safe and legal route for Ukrainians to travel directly from their country to the UK in order to seek asylum, unless they have close British relatives. A No 10 spokesperson said on Friday that troops had been deployed to help the humanitarian response in Poland and were ""working incredibly closely with Ukraine's neighbours"" to help support those fleeing. But they would not be drawn on any further action when asked about safe and legal routes for those wanting to seek asylum in the UK. Posting on social media on Saturday, Conservative MP Julian Smith said ministers must ""welcome"" those who have been displaced, and ""make it as easy as possible to be here"". ""It's really important that the United Kingdom makes an immediate open, welcoming & warm hearted commitment of sanctuary to those who wish to leave Ukraine. ""Rip up the usual bureaucracy & let's just say they are welcome & we will make it as easy as possible to be here."" Ms Cooper also tweeted on Saturday: ""Ukraine is under fire. People are fleeing war. Yet Home Office still applies normal visa restrictions inc salaries, language, close relatives."" She said this ""isn't solidarity"" with Ukraine but ""immoral"" and urged the government to ""urgently provide simple sanctuary route to UK for Ukrainians who need our help"".  The government told The Independent last week it had waived language requirements for dependents of British nationals. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Britain should be prepared to take in Ukrainian refugees, saying the government has ""got this one wrong"" in continuing to apply existing visa rules. ""We must help Ukrainian people looking for safety. That is what we have always done as a country in a moment like this,"" he said. ""The government has got this one wrong. They are applying the same rules as they had before."" He called for a ""humanitarian approach"" with ""sanctuary for those who are fleeing from Russian aggression, fleeing from this invasion, fleeing for their lives"". It comes after a poll by YouGov - following the Russian invasion - found almost two-thirds of British people would support the introduction of a resettlement scheme for those fleeing Ukraine. Ms Cooper said the war was ""already having devastating consequences"", adding: ""The UK has a duty to work with our allies to provide humanitarian assistance and support to those fleeing this horrific situation."" ""We must also work with the UN Refugee Agency to make sure contingency plans are ready for further support and sanctuary schemes that will be needed and be prepared to play our part in further international action to support refugees."" Images of Downing Street and other government buildings flying Ukrainian flags posted on social media were also met with calls to ease restrictions on movement.

3150,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,15/7/2022,984 words,Via AP news wire,Russia's information war expands through Eastern Europe," As bullets and bombs fall in Ukraine , Russia is waging an expanding information war throughout Eastern Europe, using fake accounts and propaganda to spread fears about refugees and rising fuel prices while calling the West an untrustworthy ally. In Bulgaria, the Kremlin paid journalists, political analysts and other influential citizens 2,000 euros a month to post pro-Russian content online, a senior Bulgarian official revealed this month. Researchers also have uncovered sophisticated networks of fake accounts, bots and trolls in an escalating spread of disinformation and propaganda in the country. Similar efforts are playing out in other nations in the region as Russia looks to shift the blame for its invasion of Ukraine, the ensuing refugee crisis and rising prices for food and fuel.  For Russia's leaders, expansive propaganda and disinformation campaigns are a highly cost-effective alternative to traditional tools of war or diplomacy, according to Graham Brookie, senior director at the Atlantic Council 's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which has been tracking Russian disinformation for years.  “Stirring up these reactions is the low-hanging fruit for Russian information operations,"" Brookie said. ""Their state media does audience analysis better than most of the media companies in the world. Where these narratives have succeeded are countries where there is more weaponization of domestic discourse or more polarized media markets.” Bulgaria was long counted a stalwart Russian ally, though the country of 7 million residents has turned its attention westward in recent decades, joining NATO in 2004 and the European Union three years later.  When Bulgaria, Poland and other former Warsaw Pact nations sided with their NATO allies in support of Ukraine, Russia responded with a wave of disinformation and propaganda that sought to exploit public debates over globalization and westernization.  For Poland, that took the form of anti-Western propaganda and conspiracy theories. One, spread by a Russian-allied hacking group in an apparent effort to divide Ukraine and Poland, suggested that Polish gangs were harvesting the organs of Ukrainian refugees. Russia's onslaught comes as Eastern European governments, like others around the world, grapple with dissatisfaction and unrest caused by rising prices for fuel and food. Bulgaria is in a particularly vulnerable position. Pro-Western Prime Minister Kiril Petkov lost a no confidence vote last month. Concerns about the economy and fuel prices only increased when Russia cut off Bulgaria's supply of natural gas last spring. The upheaval prompted President Rumen Radev to say his country was entering a ""political, economic and social crisis.” The government's relationship with Moscow is another complication. Bulgaria recently expelled 70 Russian diplomatic staffers over concerns about espionage, prompting the Kremlin to threaten to end diplomatic relations with it. The same week, Russia's embassy in Sofia posted a fundraising appeal urging Bulgarian citizens to donate their private funds to support the Russian army and its invasion of Ukraine. Bulgaria's government reacted angrily to Russia's attempt to solicit donations for its war from a NATO country. “This is scandalous,” tweeted Bozhidar Bozhanov, who served as minister of e-government in Petkov's cabinet. “It is not right to use the platform to finance the aggressor.” The embassy also has spread debunked conspiracy theories claiming the U.S. runs secret biolabs in Ukraine. Embassies have become key to Russia's disinformation campaigns, especially since many technology companies have begun restricting Russian state media since the invasion began. Fake accounts remain a valued part of the arsenal. Researchers at the Disinformation Situation Center uncovered what they believe is a network of fake Facebook accounts pushing Kremlin talking points and disinformation to Bulgarian audiences. The DSC, based in Europe, is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization of disinformation researchers working around the world. The network, which is still in operation, typically posts criticism of Bulgaria's decision to side with NATO over Russia. “If Bulgarians somewhere in the world have a brotherly people, it is the Russian,” read one characteristic post. Some of the content appeared to gloat over Russia's decision to cut natural gas exports: “Prepare for a dark, cold and hungry winter,” the author wrote.  Researchers at the DSC reported the network to Meta, Facebook's parent company. Meta did not respond to messages seeking comment about its decision to leave the network up. “This network is just a tiny drop in the ocean of pro-Kremlin disinformation in Bulgaria,” the DSC wrote, citing one study by a Bulgarian non-governmental organization that found pro-Russian propaganda on popular Bulgarian websites increased 10 times following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Other posts from the account attacked transgender people or featured content about QAnon, the U.S.-origin movement that argues Donald Trump is waging a covert war against satanic cannibals who secretly control world affairs. It's a conspiracy theory that has prompted violence in the U.S., and it's one Russian disinformation agents seem eager to encourage elsewhere. The operation also sought to do damage control. After a senior Bulgarian official revealed Russia's scheme to pay certain journalists, politicians or other public figures 2,000 euros, or 4,000 Bulgarian leva, for posting pro-Russian content, the Facebook accounts identified by the DSC quickly posted a rebuttal casting Russia's actions as simply those of a benevolent patron looking to support everyday Bulgarians. “Thank you Mr. Putin for the gesture, but I do not need 4000 leva to like Russia,"" the anonymous author wrote. “I like her for free.” ___ Follow AP 's coverage of misinformation at https://apnews.com/hub/misinformation.",Broadsheet,0
3161,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,29/4/2022,966 words,Jemma Crew,UK's visa schemes 'creating and heightening' trafficking and exploitation risks,"The UK's visa schemes for Ukrainian refugees are ""lacking in clarity, resourcing and accountability"" and are heightening the risk of trafficking and exploitation, according to a report. More than 100 experts have highlighted the ""troubling implications"" of the UK's visa-based response, saying they are struggling to make sense of the ""chaotic, fragmented and confusing"" system. In a report produced by experts at UCL for the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Dame Sara Thornton, the visa requirement is widely regarded as creating and heightening risks of human trafficking and exploitation. There was clear consensus among experts from across different backgrounds that new risks specific to this war are interacting with existing systemic issues in the UK, putting many refugees from Ukraine at heightened risk of human trafficking and exploitation Dr Ella Cockbain, UCL This compares to EU countries' more open responses which were seen as a ""major source of resilience"" against such threats. The UK's ""hostile environment"" is also creating a ""difficult climate"" in which to respond to the crisis, they added. The report details issues raised during a round table of experts from governmental bodies, healthcare, legal groups, law enforcement and academics. Numerous concerns were raised about the Homes for Ukraine scheme, with experts worried both about the ""deliberately predatory hosts"" and about conditions becoming increasingly exploitative over time. They identified the potential for domestic servitude, with unclear Government guidance heightening the risk of exploitative placements. And they warned that councils are likely to struggle to house refugees who need accommodation because their relatives cannot house them or their placement with a sponsor breaks down. One respondent, from an NGO , said: ""Six months is a long time to sign up to host somebody and as far as we can work out there's no back-up for what happens if it goes wrong, although on paper there is. ""But in reality there is a housing shortage, as we probably all know, and there's already thousands and thousands of Afghans waiting for housing in hotels, so what happens if a hosting placement goes wrong, where are the Ukrainian people going to go?"" They also said there is a shortage of official information for refugees, their hosts and councils, warning that a high volume of ""decentralised and fragmented material and initiatives"" could cause confusion and hinder refugees' access to support. In addition to women and children, groups particularly at risk of exploitation include separated and unaccompanied minors, older people, Roma and other minority groups, and international students. One participant, a barrister, said: ""I'm hearing from the police who are going into the brothels that they are very concerned that there's an increase in the number of Ukrainian females ... I suspect that those females are compelled into sex work rather than being more consensual sex workers, and I'm concerned about the lack of our ability from a policing and disruption and safeguarding perspective to intervene and protect."" Lead author Dr Ella Cockbain, from UCL's Department of Security & Crime Science, said: ""There was clear consensus among experts from across different backgrounds that new risks specific to this war are interacting with existing systemic issues in the UK, putting many refugees from Ukraine at heightened risk of human trafficking and exploitation - both on the way to the UK and once here."" She added: ""Simply warning people about human trafficking and modern slavery is not enough, they need to be given safer, better options and access to vital support if things go wrong."" What we must do now is put in place systematic prevention and protection measures to ensure the risks of trafficking and exploitation do not become a reality Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner Dame Sarah Thornton Dame Sara said the responses to the Homes for Ukraine scheme have shown how willing the public is to support refugees. She said: ""Thousands of individuals, organisations and businesses have offered shelter, support and job opportunities. ""What we must do now is put in place systematic prevention and protection measures to ensure the risks of trafficking and exploitation do not become a reality."" Among the report's 25 recommendations is a call for the Home Office to waive the visa requirement, improve access to support for non-Ukrainians fleeing the country, and publish regular data on how many separated and unaccompanied children are arriving in the UK. It should also ensure councils get £10,500 per refugee arriving under the Family scheme, and these refugees should get a £200 payment when they arrive, as is the case for arrivals under the Sponsorship scheme. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which has responsibility for the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, should provide information clarifying expectations around domestic chores. And it should work with councils to make clear plans for how refugees will be supported with housing if placements fall through or relatives cannot house them. A Government spokesperson said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. 86,000 visas have been granted with over 27,000 Ukrainians arriving safely in the UK. ""Thanks to changes we made to streamline the system, thousands of visas are being granted every day, but it is right that security checks are conducted on both applicants and sponsors to make sure Ukrainians fleeing the war and sponsors are safeguarded. ""Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, councils must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property and following guests arrival, they have a duty to ensure the guest is safe and well.""",Broadsheet,1

3175,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,25/3/2022,937 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,Ukrainians who have fled to UK placed in asylum hotels,"Ukrainians who have arrived in the UK after fleeing from war have been placed in hotels for asylum seekers, The Independent has learnt. Ministers are facing calls to provide ""urgent clarity"" on the rights of Ukrainian refugees entering Britain without visas after it emerged a number have arrived via ferry from Ireland in recent weeks. In some cases they have ended up in hotel accommodation, prompting concern that this leaves them in a system that is ""not fit for purpose"" and where they will face long delays on their asylum decision, creating a discriminatory approach towards those arriving without visas. The UK government has introduced two schemes to help Ukrainians: one enabling them to join relatives in Britain and the other allowing them to come to the country if they know a member of the British public who is able and willing to house them. However, the application processes for both schemes have been fraught with delays and complications, which has reportedly led some Ukrainians to make their own way to the UK without visas. Bromsgrove and District Asylum Seeker Support, which supports asylum seekers in hotels, has been supporting a Ukrainian family and a single Ukrainian woman who have entered the country in the past two weeks and been placed in hotels in Bromsgrove and Birmingham. Johannah Dyer, who volunteers for the group, said: ""They are coming in via Ireland. They will fly in from say Hungary to Ireland and then cross on a normal passenger ferry. That's not illegal. It's only when they get here and need support that they get thrown into the asylum system. ""They're very traumatised. When they first arrived two weeks ago, they were completely shell-shocked ??? They find themselves suddenly in an asylum seeker hotel with people from all around the world and they don't know what's happening at home. We know there will be others in this situation."" Katie Reilly, another volunteer for the group, added: ""They've fled the current situation, but without visas, so they have been plunged into the asylum process. We are supporting families from Afghanistan who have fled, arrived here and are declared asylum seekers. This will happen with Ukrainians in coming months - we must ensure safe routes for all."" Ukrainians who have family in the UK and arrive without a visa are eligible for a six months of leave to remain, which then allows them to switch to a visa under the family scheme, the Home Office has said. It is unclear whether those arriving without visas who do not have family in Britain are also eligible for this temporary status, and if not whether they have any other option but to enter the asylum system. Leyla Williams, deputy director of West London Welcome, a refugee charity that has been supporting newly arriving Ukrainians, said she was ""particularly concerned"" about vulnerable homeless families who have arrived without visas and have no family to join here. ""It is unclear whether they should be applying for visas or claiming asylum. Grassroots charities like ours are ensuring they are safely housed and have legal advice, but it is vital the government provide urgent clarity to those without visas,"" she said. ""There should be no discrimination towards Ukrainians who are arriving here in whichever ways they can, who are all fleeing the same war and all require protection."" Louise Calvey, of Refugee Action, said the charity was aware of a number of Ukrainians who had recently entered the UK without visas, and that it was concerned that people wouldbe forced to enter an asylum system that is ""not fit for purpose"", because of lengthy delays and poor housing. About 25,000 asylum seekers in the UK are being held in hotels, with some having been there for more than a year. Tens of thousands have been awaiting a decision on their claim for more than 12 months, with hundreds waiting for more than five years. Ms Calvey said they should be able to apply for leave to remain without having to request asylum, adding: ""Doubtless some will end up [in the asylum system] due to chronic gaps in immigration advice."" She added that requiring people to do security checks before entering the UK was ""absolute nonsense"" and that the government should be doing this once people have arrived in the country. ""By sticking to their visa requirements they've forced people through irregular routesrather than letting people in normally and checking on arrival. As per usual their policy has actually been totally counterproductive,"" she added. A government spokesperson said: ""The Ukraine Family Scheme provides an immediate pathway for Ukrainians with family already settled in the UK to come to our countryand we encourage all those who are eligible to apply.Last week we also opened a new sponsorship route, which allows Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored to come here. Ukrainians in Ireland wishing to come to the UK should apply to either of these schemes before seeking to travel. We continue to work closely with Ireland on the operation of the Common Travel Area, including data sharing and operational co-operation."" The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

3197,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,15/12/2022,1004 words,Edith M. Lederer,Ireland minister: `The world is a crazy and tragic place'," Ireland’s foreign minister says “the world is a crazy and tragic place at the moment,” pointing to the war in Ukraine and other conflicts, looming famine in the Horn of Africa, Iran’s expanding nuclear program, global impacts of climate change and a polarized U.N. Security Council as some of the major challenges. In a wide-ranging interview Wednesday with The Associated Press, Simon Coveney also addressed problems closer to home, saying he hopes that quiet ongoing negotiations between Britain , Ireland and the European Commission can resolve difficult Brexit issues by April 10, the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which largely ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland in which more than 3,000 people died. Coveney, who came to New York as Ireland is nearing the end of its two-year term on the Security Council, called his country’s experience on the U.N.’s most powerful body “one of frustration at times,” saying there are examples of the council achieving “good things, but unfortunately, there are many more examples where the Security Council has failed.” He cited its failure “over and over again” to protect vulnerable people around the world, its failure to adopt a single resolution on the war in Ukraine because of Russia’s veto power, and the council’s membership which reflects the post-World War II world not today’s global powers, and importantly has no permanent seat for an African country. Coveney said history will also be “a very harsh judge” of a lot of countries for what has been allowed to happen during the 11-year war in Syria, “and the human suffering that has flowed from that.” He said Ireland and Norway are trying to renew a resolution that expires Jan. 9 before they leave the council at the end of December that would continue U.N. authorization for humanitarian aid to be delivered from Turkey to rebel-held northwest Syria where 4.5 million people --“almost the population of Ireland” --need food, medicine, tents and education for their children. “I think we can get it done,” Coveney said. “I don’t want to say that with too much confidence because, of course, ultimately, this is up to Russia to decide.” Russia, Syria’s closest ally, has sought to reduce cross-border aid, with the aim of eliminating it, using its veto threat — and deliveries are now limited to a single crossing for just six months.  “And let’s hope that we find a way of bringing the madness of war in Ukraine to an end in a much, much shorter timeframe than has happened in Syria, or in Yemen,” he said. Civil war in Yemen began in 2014 and is continuing after a six-month truce ended in early October. When Ireland joined the Security Council in January 2021, Coveney said it never dreamed of the scale of conflict the council would attempt to try to deal with, including in Ethiopia which is “hardly in the news,” in Afghanistan where the U.S. and NATO exit and the Taliban takeover have created “huge suffering and vulnerability for the female population,” and in Ukraine. As a foreign minister and defense minister, Coveney said he never thought he would see a war in Europe with a level of “brutality and aggression” not seen since World War II where “a military superpower,” decided to try to change international borders by force by invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 and is “now unapologetically and blatantly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure as well, to try and make life impossible in Ukraine.” The minister said Ireland sees “significant war crimes happening almost on a daily basis” and is supporting the International Criminal Court, which is investigating alleged crimes, both politically and financially. Ireland is militarily neutral, he said, but it has taken in 65,000 Ukrainian refugees and is supporting the Ukrainian military by paying for items including uniforms, fuel, body armor, food and medical supplies. “So we are part of this war and we want to bring it to an end,” Coveney said. But he said Russia can’t be allowed to succeed in Europe or anywhere else because “it creates a precedent for other powerful countries to dominate their neighbors militarily,” he said. Given the sacrifices Ukraine has made --and Coveney estimated at least 250,000 civilians and military have been killed --the world must be guided by what the Ukrainian government can accept when it comes to ending the war, he said. Coveney expressed hope that through diplomacy and the military reality on the ground, Russia will change course. “I can assure you that the EU and the U.S. and other partners will not ever abandon Ukraine,” he said. Closer to home, Coveney spoke of the ongoing Brexit issues following Britain’s 2020 exit from the European Union which upended the open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain, following the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, and the lifting of trade barriers because Ireland and Britain were both EU members. When Britain left the EU, an agreement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol was reached to keep the Irish land border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of the peace deal. But instead, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. In May, Northern Ireland elected a new Assembly that saw the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein that seeks union with Ireland win the most seats for the first time and the Protestant pro-British Democratic Unionist Party coming in second.  But the DUP says the checks on goods undermine their place in the U.K. and have refused to join a power-sharing government until they are scrapped. Under the Good Friday agreement, no government can be formed without agreement of both the biggest unionist and nationalist parties. Coveney expressed hope “that in the next few weeks we will find a way to make the protocol work for everybody --unionists, nationalists, London, Dublin, Brussels, and we’ll finally allow ourselves to be able to move on from this circular and negative debate.”",Broadsheet,0
3200,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,29/9/2023,1268 words,MARY DEJEVSKY,Braverman is not completely wrong on multiculturalism,"The home secretary landed herself in not just hot, but fiercely boiling water this week with a speech she delivered thousands of miles away, at a right-wing think tank in Washington. The choice of host - the American Enterprise Institute - guaranteed Suella Braverman a friendlier reception for her speech on migration than she might have received even at some of the most steadfastly Conservative venues in London.There could also have been some benefit to the AEI. Her speech, coming from an ally, set out some of the arguments for a wholesale updating of the international asylum system, which could be useful in the run-up to a US presidential election where migration is shaping up as a major issue. Never underestimate how authoritative a British-English accent can (still) sound in Washington's corridors of power. What made the headlines at home, however, was Braverman's rejection of ""multiculturalism"". And while what she said on this score was initially condemned in some quarters as the personal ravings of a xenophobic home secretary in pursuit of her supposed ambition to be the next Tory leader, this particular attack became harder to sustain after the confirmation, somewhat late in the day perhaps, that her script had been signed off by her department and by No 10. At least some of the venom hurled in her direction seemed to reflect a misunderstanding, or at least a degree of confusion, about what ""multiculturalism"" means. And it seems to me it has two meanings. There is the general sense of a multicultural society - of which the UK may be seen as a reasonably successful example - a country where different ethnic and religious groups coexist in reasonable concord and enjoy similar prospects. Of course, the UK is a long way from being perfect, but it has been more successful than many in integrating and promoting people from a wide variety of backgrounds, as a glance at our parliament and the current cabinet would attest. Those who took Braverman to task for rejecting society were quite simply wrong. She was talking about something quite different, and this was clear from her words. What she was condemning was not the multicultural society of which she is incontrovertibly a stellar example, but what she called ""a misguided dogma of multiculturalism"", which is something quite different. It is the atomisation of society along ethnic and religious lines; it is a society where different groups are, if not actually encouraged to preserve and cultivate their difference, then given no real incentive to integrate and left to live in their own separate, or parallel, world. This is what Angela Merkel was talking about when she said, back in 2010 - in reference largely to Germany's Turkish minority, who had originally arrived as temporary ""guest workers"" - that multiculturalism (""multikulti"", as the policy of fostering pride in different identities, rather than an over-arching national identity, was known in Germany) had ""failed"". The goal from then on was to be integration, to develop a unified sense of belonging and statehood. This does not mean enforced assimilation, or asking new arrivals to reject their heritage, but it does mean requiring an effort to fit in, by learning the language, for a start, abiding by the law of the land and accepting common values - such as gender equality - in the country where they have settled. Braverman not only made that clear in her form of words, but she referred back specifically to Merkel, and to Nicolas Sarkozy and to David Cameron, in support of that same view, and even went so far as to set out what she meant. ""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate"", she said. ""It has failed, because it allowed people to come to our society, and live parallel lives in it."" The term ""parallel lives"" in this sense, in fact went back further, to the report written by Ted Cantle after race riots in Bradford and several other cities, published in 2001. Personally, I do not see what is so mistaken about this as a verdict, either then or now. Or about the idea that integration is preferable to separation, and indeed necessary, for a cohesive state. It also seems to me that most of those laying in to the home secretary this week for supposed hypocrisy - in wanting to prevent others from doing what she and her family had done - had simply got the wrong end of the stick. They weren't, by and large, opposed to integration; they were using the term multiculturalism in a different way. In fact, her political foes in the UK might have done better to engage her on the real meat of her speech, which was the need, as she and many others have seen it, to update the international protections for, and definitions of, refugees. However difficult, such a process must surely come - or else the whole system risks falling apart. The majority of provisions are rooted in the aftermath of the Second World War and the imperative to resettle millions of people displaced by six years of fighting, destruction and changed borders across Europe. My late in-laws were part of this vast human tide. They had been taken from Ukraine to occupied Sudetenland as forced labour; they had walked across Europe after their factory was bombed out by the British, and spent two years in a refugee camp in the US zone of occupation near Frankfurt, before being sponsored to the US by relatives who had fled the Bolshevik revolution. These Second World War refugees had no homes, and often no countries, to go back to - which did not prevent the British among others from trying to send Soviet citizens back to the USSR, where many faced prison camp, and worse, for what the Soviets deemed treachery. With the war in Ukraine, some of the post-Second World War refugee provisions may seem applicable once again - and the reception accorded to Ukrainian refugees in much of Europe, including the UK, could been seen as a vindication of the protections first enshrined in the UN's Refugee Convention of 1951. But this is an exception - or perhaps a justification for restricting refugee status to those fleeing war, with the added proviso that the primary reception countries should be those that are nearby. The vast majority of those arriving in Europe now, however, come from much further away and from countries where living standards are generally lower. They have made journeys that would not have been possible in the past, applying knowledge that past generations of those moving country for whatever reason would not have. Braverman posed legitimate questions about definitions of migrants and refugees. No Western country, and it is almost exclusively Western countries that are favoured destinations, can take in potentially all minority groups from countries where they face discrimination. All Afghan women? All LGBT+ people from Uganda and other African countries? All Rohingya from Burma? Under some current interpretations, they would all have a claim. How much, if any, of what Braverman said to the AEI, I wonder, will find its way into her speech to the Conservative Party conference this week? The home secretary's address on such occasions is commonly a tub-thumper, quite far removed from policy as it would be implemented even by a home secretary as far to the right as Braverman is presumed to be. Doubtless, Braverman will follow this course - which would be a pity. In the unlikely event that she used her platform to present the same arguments for reform that she made in Washington, I rather think she might get quite a favourable reception - if not from certain sections of her party, then from the country at large.",Broadsheet,0
3203,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,6/5/2022,981 words,Via AP news wire,"Hill bargainers seek Ukraine aid deal, COVID aid in question"," Lawmakers are working toward compromise on President Joe Biden's $33 billion Ukraine aid request, even as signs emerge that Democrats may need to swallow another COVID-19 setback and drop their goal of wrapping pandemic spending into the package. Bipartisan talks among House and Senate Appropriations committee leaders are underway in hopes of producing legislation Congress could vote on as soon as next week, members of both parties say. Changes in Biden's proposal are likely - the price tag, particularly for military spending, could rise - but there's wide agreement on the urgency of helping Kyiv and regional allies resist Russia's 10-week-old onslaught. Republican budget-writers ""are probably knocking some things out and adding some things. But I think by and large, everybody agrees we've got to do all we can to help,"" said No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota. He said some Republicans believe ""this package may not be robust enough, but I think it probably strikes close to the right balance."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited broad backing for the measure Thursday but warned, ""This isn't about battling climate change."" McConnell aides said he was objecting to some proposed funding to international organizations that Republicans have criticized for spending money on alternative energy initiatives.  ""If the Senate is serious about helping Ukraine win, we need to show it by passing supplemental assistance. Clean, no strings attached, and soon,"" McConnell said. One participant said bargainers must resolve details of Biden proposals to provide health care, food and other benefits to Ukrainian refugees in the U.S. and to strengthen government powers to use assets seized from billionaire friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin to help Ukraine. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the talks publicly. When Biden sent his $33 billion proposal to Congress last week, he wrote that ""to avoid needless deaths in the United States and around the world,"" Congress should include additional billions for COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. Democrats have hoped doing so would pressure the GOP to accept the pandemic spending, which Democrats say is needed to prepare for the virus' all but inevitable next curveball. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has resorted to more lawyerly language, not specifying that the two issues should be combined. ""We need to figure out the best way to get both done, and that's what we're going to try to do in the next few weeks,"" he told reporters Tuesday. Minutes earlier, McConnell spelled out his view of the best way forward. ""There is overwhelming bipartisan support for getting the Ukrainians as much help as they need as quickly as possible,"" McConnell said. ""For that to happen here in Congress, that package needs to be moved without the other extraneous issues."" While combining Ukraine and pandemic money into one package has broad Democratic support, bargainers say party leaders haven't made a final decision on that yet. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in an interview that he wants funding for Ukraine and COVID-19 tied together because both are crucial. ""It may"" fall out of the bill, Leahy said of the pandemic money, ""and I think that would be a mistake.""  Biden's overall proposal is anchored by $20 billion to help Ukraine and nearby countries defend themselves and replenish U.S. arms shipped to the area. There's $8.5 billion to bolster Ukraine's economy and government and $3 billion for refugees and to supplement food supplies around the world disrupted by the war. The proposal's fine print, contained in White House documents sent to Congress, adds texture to Biden's plans. It would make it easier for Russians with advanced degrees in more than two dozen sciences - including missile propulsion, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and cybersecurity - to get job-based visas and come to the U.S. Besides strengthening the U.S. in those fields, the move would ""undercut Russia's innovative potential, benefitting U.S. national security,"" according to the materials accompanying Biden's proposal. The documents, which break down Biden's defense request by each branch of the military, include $800,000 for the new U.S. Space Force. The expenditures are described as covering intelligence analysis, flying hours, weapon system sustainment and other costs, but no other details are provided. The overall U.S. defense budget is around $800 billion. There's nearly $600 million for Patriot anti-missile systems in Europe, money to care for wounded Ukrainian troops at an American military medical center in Germany and a proposal to let Afghan refugees who've fled to this country since the U.S. withdrawal become lawful permanent residents if they qualify. Rapid approval of Ukraine aid would let both parties avoid an election-year display of dysfunction by spiraling into a spat over the widely popular cause of helping Ukraine avoid being overpowered by Russia. Passage of Ukraine aid separately would also preserve GOP hopes of boxing Democrats into a corner on border security, an issue Republicans are banking on in November's elections for congressional control. Should Senate Democrats press ahead with a separate pandemic bill, Republicans plan to force a vote on retaining a Trump-era order citing the pandemic as justification for quickly removing asylum-seekers crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. The Biden administration has planned to let that rule expire May 23, and Democrats are divided over whether to extend it. Already this year, a White House request for $30 billion for the pandemic was cut in half and ultimately dropped by the House. A bipartisan Senate compromise then trimmed it to $10 billion, but stalled over GOP demands for a vote on immigration.",Broadsheet,1

The UK Government set out details of a sponsorship scheme allowing individuals and organisations to offer a home to refugees fleeing the fighting amid fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and Nato. Communities Secretary Michael Gove announced the ""Homes for Ukraine"" scheme as the Government scrambled to make it easier for people to come to the UK following widespread criticism of its response so far. Almost three million people have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian invasion and civilians continued to find themselves caught up in the fighting on Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Latvian counterpart Arturs Krisjanis Karins agreed during bilateral discussions in Downing Street that Mr Putin had made a ""terrible and unforgivable mistake"" in attacking Ukraine. A No 10 spokeswoman said the pair called for the Kremlin's ""indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilians"" to cease. It came after a Russian airstrike in central Kyiv killed one person and wounded six others, Ukrainian officials said, while two people were killed in the northern Obolonskyi district of the capital when artillery fire hit an apartment building. There have been 1,663 civilian casualties since the invasion, the UK's Ministry of Defence said, citing United Nations figures - although the true statistic may be far higher - with ""indiscriminate Russian shelling and air attacks... causing widespread destruction"". The UN's refugee agency believes more than 2.8 million people have left Ukraine in search of safety. The Russians claimed 20 civilians were killed in Donetsk by a ballistic missile launched by the Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian and Russian officials held further peace talks by video link and discussions are set to continue on Tuesday.  (4/4) As with previous such estimates, the true figures are likely to be significantly higher and will continue to climb as long as Russian operations continue.- Ministry of Defence (@DefenceHQ) March 14, 2022 In the Commons, Mr Gove said the Ukrainian people were ""the victims of savage, indiscriminate, unprovoked aggression"" and ""their courage under fire and their determination to resist inspires our total admiration"".Previously only Ukrainians with family members already settled in the UK could come.But under the new scheme, sponsors can provide a route for Ukrainians without family ties to come to the UK.Mr Gove said ""in recognition of their generosity"" a tax-free monthly payment of £350 will be provided to people for each family they look after.Sponsors can be of any nationality as long as they have permission to be in the UK for at least six months.NEW -UK individuals, charities, community groups & businesses can now record their interest in supporting Ukrainians fleeing the war through our new Homes for Ukraine scheme.Express an interest in becoming a sponsor now https://t.co/TnhlcpJEle #StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/vbbINAz3XP - Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (@luhc) March 14, 2022 A new website will allow people to record their interest ahead of phase one of the scheme opening for applications for Friday. The potential for the conflict in Ukraine to trigger a wider clash between Russia and Nato was underlined over the weekend with a strike close to the border with Poland. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky warned it was ""only a matter of time"" before the alliance was struck following a Russian attack on a base less than 15 miles from the border with Nato member Poland. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he believed a direct attack on a Nato member was still ""very unlikely"", but warned it would trigger a response from the alliance, which has a policy of mutual defence. Mr Javid told BBC's Today programme: ""We've made it very clear to the Russians even before the start of this conflict. ""Even if a single Russian toecap steps into Nato territory, then it will be considered an act of war."" The attack on the Yavoriv base, which has previously been used by Nato to train Ukrainian soldiers, was one of the western-most targets struck by Russia during the invasion. Mr Zelensky, who spoke to Mr Johnson on Sunday, used the attack near the Polish frontier to renew his call for Nato allies to ""close"" the skies above Ukraine. Downing Street said the strike so close to a Nato member is ""deeply concerning"" and that the UK is seeking to build the ""broadest possible coalition"" against the Russian aggression. ""These strikes are deeply concerning,"" the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. ""We want everyone in the international community to condemn Putin's barbaric acts."" In other developments: - Justice Secretary Dominic Raab visited The Hague on Monday to offer UK legal expertise and technical support to the International Criminal Court as it considers allegations of war crimes. - The UK will supply Ukraine with more than 500 portable generators to provide energy for essential services, including at hospitals and shelters. - NHS England will provide treatment for 21 Ukrainian children with cancer forced to flee Ukraine. - The Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill is expected to clear Parliament and become law, paving the way for dozens more oligarchs to be sanctioned. - Protesters occupied a mansion belonging to sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska in Belgravia, London. - The Government is exploring whether properties linked to sanctioned Russians could be used to house refugees. The escalation of the war in western Ukraine came as Mr Johnson was hosting leaders from the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF), an alliance of northern European nations. Representatives from Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway were due to dine with Mr Johnson at his Chequers country retreat on Monday night before talks in London on Tuesday. During his call with Mr Zelensky on Sunday, Mr Johnson ""said the UK would continue to pursue more options for bolstering Ukraine's self-defence"" including at the JEF meeting.",Broadsheet,1

Steve Marshall-Taylor, head of senior school at Brighton College , said his school had made 17 offers of free places for Ukrainian refugees, with 16 having already arrived. An experienced pastoral teacher is working with the students individually to create a suitable curriculum and gauge their level of English. What I think we're aware of is a sort of ongoing sense of them navigating the trauma of the destruction of their home country but also so many people that they've left behind, and friends Steve Marshall-Taylor ""What I think we're aware of is a sort of ongoing sense of them navigating the trauma of the destruction of their home country, but also so many people that they've left behind, and friends,"" he said. ""Every day they are navigating what we see on the news or hear on the radio,"" he said. Mr Marshall-Taylor said visas were not being processed quickly enough, with a host parent who was a trained legal professional spending five to six hours filling in the forms with the Ukrainian mother and daughter she was supporting. ""It was incredibly difficult just to complete the forms and then there was a huge time lag for almost all of them, I think, and that sort of void of uncertainty ... we knew we had wonderful families, we had school places, we had uniform and everything was ready, we had a sense we could provide some good opportunities, but there has just been this wait."" A silver lining of this, he said, was that pupils had become involved in the democratic process through writing to their local MP to ask about the progress of the visas. Samantha Price, head of Benenden School and president of the Girls' Schools Association, said her school had opened up a boarding place for a Ukrainian student this term, so that she could start studying her A-levels in science in September, while two day school places had been offered to other refugee pupils. She added that for the student who would be boarding, ""it's complex and it's really frustrating"". ""She's going to be travelling on her own and her mother has managed to get her out of the Ukraine - they live in Odesa. But her visa hasn't come through ... because she's going to be a minor travelling on her own and there's a worry about trafficking."" The girl can no longer stay with her mother in Moldova , so she could either travel with her mother back to Odesa or to the UK, but at the moment the Home Office is not granting her a visa. The girl's proposed guardian in the UK has now offered to fly to Moldova, which Ms Price said she hoped would be ""a way forward"". Ms Price added that she understood the concerns about trafficking, ""but I think there must be a better system if guardians over here through an expected scheme have been recognised, there must be a way then for those pupils being able to fly over without having to go through this level of delay and uncertainty"". Ms Price said that if a guardian had gone through barring checks pupils should be able to fly over on their own to speed up the visa process. She said her school was offering ""bespoke"" support to the pupils - one pupil who has limited English will be able to take qualifications in Russian as well as studying biology and English as an additional language. ""It's also the fact that these students are coming from a war zone and ensuring that they have the right levels of pastoral care, with trauma counselling and so on."" The boarding school pupil's peers have opted to ""kit out"" her dorm in order to welcome her, with duvet covers, cushions, fairy lights and plants ""so that when she arrives she has a happy dormitory to go into"", while parent donors have offered to cover the cost of any extra-curricular trips or activities for the pupils. Tim Firth, headmaster of Wrekin College, said his school had a link with the country, as there were four Ukrainian pupils on roll prior to the conflict, and that he had been in contact with them to ensure they had not gone back to Ukraine over the holidays. The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, a group of leading UK private schools, wrote to Wrekin asking if they could help and he offered up free places for refugee pupils fleeing the conflict. One girl is due to start in September in the sixth form, and two younger pupils in key stage three have already started at the school, as they are related to a British-Ukrainian family at the school. ""Apart from it being a privilege and proper to help, Ukrainian pupils are often really impressive,"" he said, adding ""their English is tremendous"". ""So this is about them helping us and lifting our community,"" he said. The school's Wrekin International Group has held a parade in honour of Ukraine and Mr Firth said pupils were having their ""eyes opened"" about the realities of the conflict. ""If you're sitting next to somebody who's telling you on the way to mass about what happened to them, that's a better lesson than most of us get while we're at school ... You just really have your eyes opened, and that sort of soft education's going on all the time, and that's PSHE, without being pompous, at its best."" Mr Firth said he was using his school's foundation, which raises money for bursaries in order to provide free places but that it would be helpful for the Government to fund places, particularly at boarding schools. ""Would we like to do more? Gosh, yes. Is money preventing us from doing it? To a large extent it is. So would it be great if the Government funded places at very good schools like Wrekin, yes."" ""Boarding schools in particular, they can take children and it's not ridiculous to think that they could take children of Ukrainian parents still out there,"" he said.",Broadsheet,1
3260,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,12/3/2022,1075 words,AMANDA COAKLEY,"Fear of new discrimination stalks the Romani refugees; With tens of thousands crossing from Ukraine into Hungary, the community faces a cold welcome from Orban's regime","As the warnings grew ever louder in the weeks before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Romani man Maxsim became increasingly concerned about his family and their community in the western Ukrainian city of Vynohradiv. While he was worried about what he would do if a war started and his work as a labourer dried up, the 21-year-old did not believe deep down that there would be full-scale conflict. So when Russian missiles started raining down on Ukrainian soil on 24 February, Maxsim was stunned, and heartbroken. He knew his family needed a plan and immediately gathered with his Roma community to discuss their collective response and next steps. Several men said they wanted to stay and fight for Ukraine. Wealthier families donated money to poorer ones to ensure they had basic supplies. It was decided that some men would lead the women and children out of the country, find work abroad, and send the money back home to ensure more could leave in case their community was sidelined by the national humanitarian effort. Maxsim was tasked with taking his 16-year-old wife, Christina, their one-year-old daughter, and his entire extended family - about 25 people in total - to Hungary, a journey that they said took two days despite it only being 20km as the crow flies. ""The second the invasion happened, the work we had lined up disappeared, so we had to go,"" Maxsim, who only gave his first name, told The Independent. ""My parents refused to leave, so it was all up to me to navigate the transport and get everyone to safety."" When the group arrived at the Tiszabecs crossing between Ukraine and Hungary, Maxsim was not stopped despite Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's ban on men aged between 18 to 60 leaving the country. Maxsim says no one asked him questions when they saw he was a Roma. Activists told The Independent that other Romani men have been prevented from leaving Ukraine at the border and conscripted into the military, seemingly making the outcome dependent on how a particular border guard views the community. Approximately 100,000 Romani people have left Ukraine in the last two weeks, according to figures given from the European Roma Rights Centre, although the real number is likely to be considerably higher. Before the invasion and ensuing exodus, there were believed to be anywhere between 300,000 and 400,000 Romani people in Ukraine, according to various estimates. Although well established and self-sufficient in the country, the Roma have long been sidelined by Ukrainian society and subjected to discrimination and violence. Human Rights Watch (HRW) last November warned there was widespread online hate speech against the Roma community in several cities, and said that while attacks on Romani people were frequent, official investigations tended to fall by the wayside. And now the war has exposed them to new challenges. Although the majority of Roma live in Ukraine's western Zakarpattia region, those settled in the north and east of the country are finding it difficult to reach safety due to a lack of cash and identification documents. Furthermore, they are unsure of how they will be received abroad, that is if they are even allowed to enter another country. ""At the moment there is unprecedented support and tolerance for Ukrainian refugees??? however, we are already seeing unequal treatment of Romani refugees,"" said Jonathan Lee, spokesperson for the European Roma Rights Centre. ""They are more likely to be refused at borders, more likely to be neglected by local authorities once they cross ??? and they are also less likely to be hosted in small family apartments in European cities."" The journey to Tiszabecs was particularly hard for Christina, who had been terrified she might have to make the journey alone. ""Having my husband and family with me has made a scary situation better,"" she said, cradling her infant in the village hall in Tiszabecs. She has no idea what is in store in the days and weeks ahead, but hopes Maxsim will ultimately find work on construction sites in the capital, Budapest, in order to ensure their survival and send money home to help get the rest of their family out of Ukraine. However, their prospects in the country could well hinge on the stance of the government and nationalist leader Viktor Orban towards the Roma community - with campaigners fearful of how things might develop as the number of Romani arrivals increases. Mr Orban has long been accused of anti-Roma sentiment, while his government has supported the segregation of Romani children in schools and hinted that the community should not be entitled to the same family state benefits as the rest of the population. ""There have been some reports of ethnic profiling on the Hungary-Ukraine border, but several aid organisations have been working to counter that,"" Bernard Rorke, a long-time campaigner for Roma rights in Hungary, told The Independent. ""This government is without scruples and their behaviour is determined by what they deem to be political necessity. Orban has not hesitated before to single out the Roma for political gain as he has scapegoated the LGTBQ community,"" he added. Hungary has received more than 214,000 refugees from Ukraine so far - amid an exodus that has seen at least 2.3 million people flee in total - although it is unknown how many of these are Romani people. Members of the Roma community have also fled to other neighbouring countries including Moldova and Romania. Across Eastern Europe, observers and analysts have pointed out how Ukrainians have been treated favourably compared to the millions of people from nations such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Eritrea who have been arriving at the EU's borders and shores in recent years. Nevertheless, the local community in Tiszabecs have opened their arms to all those fleeing Russia's war, according to the village's army of volunteers. The village hall has been inundated with so many donations that they have started to turn away perishable goods, while a stall selling Langos, a Hungarian street dish, has been set up to feed people in need of a hearty meal after their long trek to safety. ""Teachers, old people, chefs, everyone has come to help people in need and in many cases that's Romani people,"" said Peter Borbely, the village's headmaster who closed his school for three days to focus on the humanitarian response. ""Everyone needs some support and that is what we will continue to provide. We'll keep going until the very end.""",Broadsheet,1

The Oireachtas Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee heard from Simon Coveney on Thursday, who said the Irish Government was taking precautions against potential cyber attacks. His appearance comes amid the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine, with Ireland poised to potentially take in tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn country. ""There is an increased cyber threat in our assessment. And we are taking the the appropriate precautions in relation to that in terms of a heightened sense of awareness and concern in that space,"" Mr Coveney told TDs and senators. That is an outrageous act of aggression that cannot go unchecked. Simon Coveney, on the Mariupol maternity and children's hospital attack The Foreign Affairs minister, responding to a question from Fine Gael TD David Stanton, also indicated that Ireland is currently preparing to send defence equipment to Ukraine. The country has already signed up to an EU-wide fund to provide arms and equipment to Ukraine, although Ireland as a militarily neutral nation has already committed to providing non-lethal equipment only. Mr Coveney said: ""We're also looking to see what actual gear we can provide as well. We're making some decisions on that actually shortly having looked at what we have that is spare and available. ""And you'd be surprised - there's not as much as you might think. ""But there is some military defence equipment that I think would be useful and we're making decisions on that actually as we speak today. And we'll get it to Ukraine as quickly as we can."" Mr Coveney began his brief appearance at the committee by condemning the ""unconscionable attack"" on a maternity and children's hospital in Mariupol. ""This event speaks directly to the need for international pressure to be brought to bear, so that this senseless conflict can be halted,"" he told politicians. ""That is an outrageous act of aggression that cannot go unchecked and we will, as I believe many other countries will as well, ensure there is accountability through all the legal mechanisms available and the legal entities available globally, to to respond to atrocities like that."" However, Mr Coveney was less than certain about the likelihood of Vladimir Putin appearing before the International Criminal Court (ICC) to answer for alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops in Ukraine. The ICC has already announced that an investigation has begun into the situation in Ukraine and any possible war crimes. ""I'm a big supporter of the ICC. So is Ireland. But there are lots of powerful countries who aren't and so it's really important that this process has begun and in terms of gathering of information and evidence and so on. Whether it will actually result in a prosecution of a President Putin remains to be seen,"" he said. Mr Coveney did not rule out the possibility of further sanctions being imposed on Russia by the EU. ""The key priority now is the rapid and effective implementation of all of sanctions agreed to date. Discussions will also continue at EU level on possible additional sanctions,"" he said. ""The implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for all of us in Europe, are profound. Every part of Government is working intensely,"" he said. Stressing that Ireland is playing a key role in the global moves to resist Russian aggression in Europe, he said that it was vital that civilians are protected as the conflict continues. ""Whatever is agreed, or not agreed - on humanitarian corridors or other measures - civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. ""This applies both to those who choose to leave and those who choose to remain. It is a core obligation under international humanitarian law."" Mr Coveney also said that around 45 Irish citizens remain in Ukraine, while 157 have left the country. He added that the country remains a welcoming place to Russian and Belarusians and had no issue with the citizens of either country. He went on: ""The Russian and Belarusian communities in Ireland are part of the fabric of this nation and it is important that we continue to show them that they are welcome here, just as we will for the many Ukrainians now seeking refuge here with us in Ireland."" Mr Coveney was also quizzed on reports that the Irish ambassador to Russia, Brian McElduff, was summoned by the Russian authorities in Moscow. ""In terms of of our ambassador in Moscow, I'm not going to go into conversations that have happened between the ambassador and authorities in Moscow apart from to say - it's not that unusual when there's tension, for our ambassador abroad to be called in by a foreign office in another country. ""It's happened in Israel many times,"" he said. ""He was asked in, after the incident in the Russian embassy here in Dublin, which was an unfortunate incident actually, because it's distracted away from some of the core messages that we need to be delivering. ""But that was not an unexpected conversation. And I'm not overly surprised by it at all."" Mr Coveney repeatedly expressed his admiration for the proactive response of the EU and the warm welcome Ukrainian refugees have received. ""The generosity of the response has just been breathtaking as far as I'm concerned. I mean, the most difficult issue, politically, in the European Union for the last 10 years has been migration. ""We couldn't agree on anything in terms of how to deal with migration, how to burden share in the EU, how countries in northern and western Europe could support countries in the south that were being impacted by significant numbers of migrants and asylum seekers coming from North Africa and the Middle East and so on. ""And within the space of 48 hours, the EU effectively signed off on a temporary protection mechanism, which essentially allowed an unlimited number of Ukrainians to come into the EU, anywhere in the EU, and effectively be treated as EU citizens. ""The response from countries that are highly sensitive politically, to migration, generally, like Hungary, Slovakia and Poland in particular over the last number of years, have just set all of that aside,"" he said.",Broadsheet,0

The only criticism came from Keir Starmer, for the opposition, who said he had not gone far enough in applying economic sanctions to the Putin regime. In the cathedral, where he said ""I am not a great preacher"" before launching into ""the story in the gospel"" of the Samaritan, he was greeted with a standing ovation and chants of, ""thank you, thank you."" And then in Warsaw this morning, he was asked why he wouldn't enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine by a tearful Ukrainian journalist who accused him of being afraid. He listened and explained, as mournfully as he could, that it would not be a good idea for the UK to go to war with Russia, and that it was Putin and Putin alone who must bear responsibility for the tragedy unfolding in Europe. They were good speeches, better suited to Johnson's oratory than many of the speeches he gave during the pandemic. The best of his pandemic speeches was when he had just come out of hospital and paid tribute to the immigrant nurses who had looked after him and the doctors - ""several of them for some reason called Nick"" - who treated him. In that one he managed to tell a personal and political story of his devotion to the ideal of the National Health Service: ""It is the best of this country. It is unconquerable. It is powered by love."" But for most of the pandemic, the tension between the prime minister's liberal instincts and the desire to lead the nation in a total war - against a virus - meant that his message was confused and contradictory. An actual war ought to be a better subject for Johnson's Churchillian instincts - instincts that he has never hidden. It was only eight years ago, while he was still mayor of London in 2014, that he wrote The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History. It is a terrible book, put together in a hurry, and padded out by awarding ""Churchill Factor"" ratings out of 10 to all and sundry, but its message could not have been more obvious. I am a man of destiny, it said, ready to be called from the wilderness to save my country in its hour of need. In a way, that is what Johnson did, for the narrow majority of his fellow citizens who voted to leave the EU. But that didn't turn out to be a moment of moral clarity akin to standing alone against the Nazis. It turned out to be rather difficult, complicated and bureaucratic, and our Churchillian prime minister seemed rather bored by customs declarations. Now, though, we have a war in Europe, a war of national survival. But it is a war of national survival for Ukraine, not Britain, and Britain is prevented by the reality of nuclear deterrence from direct military intervention. Again, the Churchillian template doesn't fit. This is a war by proxy and by sanctions, fought in the belief that Putin is bound to fail and the UK should do what we can from the outside to make that happen more quickly, while we are unable, as Johnson tried to explain to Daria Kaleniuk, the Ukrainian journalist, to wage war ourselves.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here Nor does the Churchillian demand for national sacrifice match the moment. We can see how much Johnson admires Volodymyr Zelensky , the Ukrainian president, to whom he seems to speak nearly every day - a leader who is prepared to summon his people to a supreme effort of national resistance. But when it comes to asking the British people to pay a price for solidarity with the Ukrainians, Johnson has been muted.  In the Commons it was Starmer, not the prime minister, who spoke of the ""economic pain"" that we would have to suffer in order to put meaningful pressure on Putin's regime. It was only in his speech in Poland today that Johnson declared: ""We should recognise that this crisis will impose costs on ourselves and our electorates, that sanctions have consequences for us as well as for Russia, and no step is free of risk."" That reference to ""our electorates"" was most un-Churchillian, and a clue to Johnson's realisation that he is not going to emulate his hero this time, either. The unspoken question behind the rapidly changing foreign policy of not just Britain, but Germany, the US and other Nato allies, is about how much pain the voters in the world's democracies are prepared to endure, and for how long. It is the question behind cutting the world off from Russian oil and gas, and in a different form, it is the question behind our policies towards Ukrainian refugees.  It is wrong to see refugees as a burden, as several MPs said in the debate in the Commons on the statement by Priti Patel, the home secretary, today, but that is nevertheless how they may be seen if the British people's generosity is not sustained over the long run.  In his speech in the Ukrainian Catholic cathedral, the prime minister said: ""Never in all my study, my memory of politics and international affairs have I seen such a clear distinction between right and wrong, between good and evil, between light and dark."" That kind of Churchillian moral clarity may be admirable, but Johnson may be wondering how useful it is as a guide to action. ",Broadsheet,0
3276,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,29/7/2022,1193 words,MARY DEJEVSKY,War in Ukraine has shown the virtues of national service,"The war in Ukraine has brought the brutality of armed conflict home to generations of Europeans who had lived their whole lives in peace. It has had a particular immediacy because of satellite television, social media and the millions of refugees who have brought their ineradicable memories into exile with them. Amid all the horror, however, it is possible to identify one positive: the huge mobilisation of, especially, young Ukrainians who immediately volunteered to join the war effort, contributing in whatever way they could. Many - not only young men - took up arms and set off to fight the enemy, wherever that enemy was to be found. By no means everyone took up arms; many others have helped to organise evacuations, ensure medical care or distribute food supplies. A ""PR army"" (metaphorically) bombards people like me with information. And however great the death and destruction around them, it is not uncommon to hear Ukrainians sounding, if not actually happy, then (to an outsider) surprisingly upbeat and fulfilled. They see their involvement as a formative experience; they are busy and feel useful, some for the first time in their lives. The war has given a lot of people a new and very real sense of purpose, and that includes young men who might never have ventured beyond their home areas and found it hard to find jobs. The crime rate, it has been noted, has gone down. Adversity, of course, calls forth its own heroes. Remember the volunteer efforts that sprang up in the early months of the Covid pandemic, in the UK as in many other countries, and the spontaneous help, in Poland and elsewhere, for Ukrainian refugees? To delve into the past, I and many others will recall female relatives reminiscing with a degree of nostalgia about their ""war work"", from driving officers to packing parachutes, manufacturing munitions or taking their place on the fire-watching rota. Anyone could do something, and felt needed. That, as well as stoical solidarity, is what the hackneyed ""Blitz spirit"" was about. I don't want to underrate the extreme traumas suffered by those who fought, or who experienced conflict - traumas that last to this day, and will surely mark Ukrainians, too, far into the future. But might there not be something to be learned from a national war effort that mobilises everyone and proceeds from the belief, the necessary belief, that everyone can contribute in some way? And that this effort can work to the individual and common good? This is why I have in the past supported the principle of some sort of national service, and might also be why David Cameron's National Citizen Service - proposed as part of his Big Society initiative in 2010 - was generally favourably received. That it failed to flourish - to the point where its budget has been slashed and an independent investigation described it as akin to a ""holiday camp for middle-class kids"" - underlines some of the difficulties in organising such a project in peacetime, but not that it should be entirely written off. One drawback is that the young people who tend to join organised volunteer efforts are by and large - and I realise this is a generalisation - those who can afford it and whose life prospects are already good. Those who might benefit most from leaving their immediate surroundings and trying something new are often the least likely to have that chance. Which is why I have supported not only the principle of some sort of national service, but the idea that it should be compulsory. Yes, obligatory for everyone. And this is not only for reasons of social equity - the offspring of the better-off and better-connected should not be able to buy or network their way out, nor should those with lesser means feel that they would not fit in - but also to demonstrate what is currently being demonstrated to such effect in Ukraine: that everyone, whatever their means and their background, can contribute in some way. But surely, you might object, it is different for Ukraine, which is engaged in a military struggle for its very survival. Why should the UK and other countries at peace disburse any resources at all, given the improbability of war. Maybe. But it is not necessary to envisage a military conflict on the horizon to believe that there could be an emergency of some kind or other around the corner and that it would be better for citizens who have known only peace to be prepared. Seen from outside the country, the UK has an enviable degree of public resilience. People tend to keep calm; they are resourceful; they help: the public response to the 7/7 London bombings and other attacks are testament to that. But might it not be an asset if more people, a lot more people, were trained from an early age in a range of emergency skills? First aid, elementary civil defence, even - I can already hear the qualms - how to handle a firearm? It is routine for journalists, aid workers and others going to conflict zones to take what is known as a hostile environment course. Is that sort of knowledge - about how to avoid or respond to attack, how to tell incoming from outgoing fire, how to defend yourself - not useful for everyone, not just those who expect to find themselves in a war zone? Keeping fit, knowing how to swim (eight young men drowned in the recent heatwave), reading a map, using GPS, basic navigation? How many of us know how to do this? How many would benefit from such skills? A new national service need not be primarily military or even military at all. Nor, if it introduced such a programme, would the UK be a particular outlier. More countries than you might imagine either never abolished national service or have reintroduced something of the kind, with civilian and military strands. Sweden reintroduced conscription as recently as 2017, in part as a social solidarity measure, and the subject is a hot topic again in the Netherlands and Germany. The fiercest opposition tends to come not only from those reluctant to spend a year or so of their lives in this way, but from the top brass, who argue that in this day and age they need committed professionals, not ""kids"" just parked with them for a few months. With the military starting to be called upon again to supplement services at home, they might need to rethink. As the Commonwealth Games open in Birmingham and London basks in nostalgia 10 years after the London Olympics, I would add as a footnote the role played by young volunteers, many of whom discovered strengths that might otherwise have lain undiscovered. In particular, I remember watching two teenage marshals shepherding huge crowds over the complicated crossing at Marble Arch, with a confident charm that would surely stand them in good stead later on. It is a long way from Marble Arch 2012 to the war raging in Ukraine today. But the hidden link is the opportunity people have to feel needed and to serve a purpose, as the late Senator John McCain used to say, greater than themselves. There is a good argument to be made that everyone could devote a small part of peacetime to acquiring habits and skills that might one day become life-savers - even in emergencies that fall well short of war.",Broadsheet,0
3291,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,27/3/2022,1118 words,May Bulman,The descendants of Jewish refugees opening their doors to Ukrainians in the UK,"As millions of Ukrainians flee from the devastation caused by Vladimir Putin 's troops, many people in the UK have come forward to offer their homes. More than 150,000 Brits have signed up to the government's Homes for Ukraine hosting scheme. The scheme itself has got off to a slow start, which has prompted some criticism. But the outpouring of compassion and willingness to help has been immense, and prospective hosts are hoping they will soon be able to offer traumatised refugees a roof over their head and some comfort. Some have registered directly to the government's portal, while others are signing up via charities well-versed in facilitating refugee hosting in the UK, such as Positive Action in Housing's Rooms for Refugees programme and Refugees at Home's hosting scheme. Among those keenest to host are people for whom this refugee crisis feels particularly close to home, because it wasn't long ago that their own parents and grandparents were forced to make a similar escape, fleeing antisemitism in Europe and finding sanctuary in the UK.  The Independent has spoken to Britons whose Jewish ancestors fled either the pogroms in the late 19th and early 20th century or the Nazi regime during the Second World War, and have now signed up to become hosts.   Louise Kaye, 64, from Chiswick, London  Both of my grandfathers fled from anti-Jewish violence in Ukraine in the 1890s. They came to England as an unknown country and they did not know what sort of welcome they'd receive, but they made good lives for themselves eventually. My late husband and I signed up to host in 2019 to take a Syrian refugee, but he fell ill later that year so it didn't happen. When the Ukraine war started, I suddenly thought of my grandfathers, and thought if I can help − a mother and child or a couple of children - I have the space to do that. I live alone now but I often have someone else living here. I have a big house and to justify staying here I have to have other people here. I love it. They can have the top floor: a bedroom, a kitchen with a little sitting room, a loo and there's a bathroom on the floor below which they can use too. I could just imagine my great-grandparents being in exactly that situation and being absolutely terrified of having their houses burnt down and just knowing they had to flee to save their lives and protect their children.  Lesley Schatzberger, 69, from York  I am the daughter of child refugees from Nazi Vienna. My father came on Kindertransport aged 12 in May 1939. His parents were due to travel on 9 September but war broke out on the 1st. They were taken to Auschwitz and died there. My mum came with her family. Both my parents came here with very little. My dad had a small suitcase, a typewriter and his piano accordion. He had to build his life from that. They both grew up in the Manchester area and met at a youth club. I felt like I couldn't not host. I wouldn't be alive if my parents were not given sanctuary here. They lost everything, and it's just unbelievable that this is happening again now. The lessons haven't been learnt.  We have a basement flat with a kitchen and its own bathroom, so we could host a family. We've had students there and have offered to host Syrian refugees before. We have enough space.  The government should be looking at this as an opportunity for people to come to our society and for us to get to know them, to help them - and maybe they'll help us.  The Independent is raising money for the people of Ukraine - if you would like to donate then please click here for our GoFundMe page.   Jimmy Strauss, 62, from Belsize Park, London  My parents were born in Germany and they were Jewish refugees from the Nazi system. My father left relatively young in 1933. He came and made a life over here. My mother came here with her family in 1939. I'm steeped in a refugee background. The community where I worship − at Belsize Square Synagogue − was founded by refugees and continues to use a number of their melodies. Britain was very good to my family. I've got room in this house and I feel, and my whole family feels, it is our duty to help these people. I cannot begin to imagine what they're going through. We have a spare room with an ensuite bathroom - it could fit an adult and at least two children, possibly more, depending on what is needed. If we can provide a roof over their head, a bit of security, warmth and some food to begin to alleviate the pain they're going through, it's the very, very least we can do.  Katherine Richards, 61, from Hove  My mother was a Jewish refugee and fled Austria at the age of five with my grandmother in 1938. They escaped to Holland on foot at night-time. I know it would have been terrifying. At one point they were caught by the Nazis, but they got away and managed to catch the last boat to the UK. They wound up in Hertfordshire with no English skills. My mother was the only female refugee in the village. She learnt to speak English from the get-go and taught my grandmother how to speak the language. Then grandfather got here and said: ""Now we are here, we're going to stay here."" I think about my grandmother every day now. She'd be absolutely appalled. I think the very least we can do is open our border to those fleeing Ukraine. All this nonsense about visas and passports is so preposterous. I have space for a single person. I'll make sure they're warm, comfy, loved and cared for. My mum will be involved too. She wants to help and she of all people will understand their plight. My family history is not usually at the forefront of my mind, but seeing Ukrainian refugees on TV has really resonated with me. My mother and grandmother had to make a terrifying escape. Ukrainians are going to have similar stories to tell.

3301,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,12/3/2022,1216 words,Amanda Coakley,Ukraine's Roma refugees face uncertain future under threat of discrimination in Hungary,"As the warnings grew ever louder in the weeks before Russia 's invasion of Ukraine , Romani man Maxsim became increasingly concerned about his family and their community in the western Ukrainian city of Vynohradiv. While he was worried about what he would do if a war started and his work as a labourer dried up, the 21-year-old did not believe deep down that there would be full-scale conflict. So when Russian missiles started raining down on Ukrainian soil on 24 February, Maxsim was stunned, and heartbroken. He knew his family needed a plan and immediately gathered with his Roma community to discuss their collective response and next steps. Several men said they wanted to stay and fight for Ukraine. Wealthier families donated money to poorer ones to ensure they had basic supplies. It was decided that some men would lead the women and children out of the country, find work abroad, and send the money back home to ensure more could leave in case their community was sidelined by the national humanitarian effort. Maxsim was tasked with taking his 16-year-old wife, Christina, their one-year-old daughter, and his entire extended family - about 25 people in total - to Hungary , a journey that they said took two days despite it only being 20km as the crow flies. ""The second the invasion happened, the work we had lined up disappeared, so we had to go,"" Maxsim, who only gave his first name, told The Independent. ""My parents refused to leave, so it was all up to me to navigate the transport and get everyone to safety."" When the group arrived at the Tiszabecs crossing between Ukraine and Hungary, Maxsim was not stopped despite Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's ban on men aged between 18 to 60 leaving the country. Maxsim says no one asked him questions when they saw he was a Roma. Activists told The Independent that other Romani men have been prevented from leaving Ukraine at the border and conscripted into the military, seemingly making the outcome dependent on how a particular border guard views the community. Approximately 100,000 Romani people have left Ukraine in the last two weeks, according to figures given from the European Roma Rights Centre, although the real number is likely to be considerably higher. Before the invasion and ensuing exodus, there were believed to be anywhere between 300,000 and 400,000 Romani people in Ukraine, according to various estimates.  We are already seeing unequal treatment of Romani refugees  Jonathan Lee, European Roma Rights Centre Although well established and self-sufficient in the country, the Roma have long been sidelined by Ukrainian society and subjected to discrimination and violence. Human Rights Watch (HRW) last November warned there was widespread online hate speech against the Roma community in several cities, and said that while attacks on Romani people were frequent, official investigations tended to fall by the wayside. And now the war has exposed them to new challenges. Although the majority of Roma live in Ukraine's western Zakarpattia region, those settled in the north and east of the country are finding it difficult to reach safety due to a lack of cash and identification documents. Furthermore, they are unsure of how they will be received abroad, that is if they are even allowed to enter another country. ""At the moment there is unprecedented support and tolerance for Ukrainian refugees... however, we are already seeing unequal treatment of Romani refugees,"" said Jonathan Lee, spokesperson for the European Roma Rights Centre. ""They are more likely to be refused at borders, more likely to be neglected by local authorities once they cross ... and they are also less likely to be hosted in small family apartments in European cities."" The journey to Tiszabecs was particularly hard for Christina, who had been terrified she might have to make the journey alone. ""Having my husband and family with me has made a scary situation better,"" she said, cradling her infant in the village hall in Tiszabecs. She has no idea what is in store in the days and weeks ahead, but hopes Maxsim will ultimately find work on construction sites in the capital, Budapest, in order to ensure their survival and send money home to help get the rest of their family out of Ukraine. However, their prospects in the country could well hinge on the stance of the government and nationalist leader Viktor Orban towards the Roma community - with campaigners fearful of how things might develop as the number of Romani arrivals increases. Mr Orban has long been accused of anti-Roma sentiment, while his government has supported the segregation of Romani children in schools and hinted that the community should not be entitled to the same family state benefits as the rest of the population. ""There have been some reports of ethnic profiling on the Hungary-Ukraine border, but several aid organisations have been working to counter that,"" Bernard Rorke, a long-time campaigner for Roma rights in Hungary, told The Independent. ""This government is without scruples and their behaviour is determined by what they deem to be political necessity. Orban has not hesitated before to single out the Roma for political gain as he has scapegoated the LGTBQ community,"" he added. Hungary has received more than 214,000 refugees from Ukraine so far -amid an exodus that has seen at least 2.3 million people flee in total -although it is unknown how many of these are Romani people. Members of the Roma community have also fled to other neighbouring countries including Moldova and Romania. Across Eastern Europe, observers and analysts have pointed out how Ukrainians have been treated favourably compared to the millions of people from nations such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Eritrea who have been arriving at the EU's borders and shores in recent years. Nevertheless, the local community in Tiszabecs have opened their arms to all those fleeing Russia's war, according to the village's army of volunteers. The village hall has been inundated with so many donations that they have started to turn away perishable goods, while a stall selling Langos, a Hungarian street dish, has been set up to feed people in need of a hearty meal after their long trek to safety. ""Teachers, old people, chefs, everyone has come to help people in need and in many cases that's Romani people,"" said Peter Borbely, the village's headmaster who closed his school for three days to focus on the humanitarian response. ""Everyone needs some support and that is what we will continue to provide. We'll keep going until the very end.""

3308,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,3/3/2022,1159 words,Via AP news wire,Russia-Ukraine War: What to know on Day 8 of Russian assault,"Delegations from Russia and Ukraine are expected to hold talks in Belarus on Thursday, a second round of face-to-face discussions since the Russian invasion eight days ago. In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up their resistance, but didn't comment on whether the Russians have seized any cities. ""They will have no peace here,"" Zelenskyy said, calling on the Russian soldiers to ""go home"" and describing them as ""confused children who have been used."" His comments come as Russia acknowledged for the first time since the start of the invasion that nearly 500 Russian troops have been killed in the fighting and around 1,600 wounded. Ukraine has not released a similar casualty figure for its armed forces. Ukraine's State Emergency Service has said more than 2,000 civilians have died, though it was impossible to verify the claim. The U.N. human rights office said it had recorded the deaths of 136 civilians, including 13 children, in Ukraine since the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded last week. It marks the swiftest exodus of refugees this century. Also, the U.N. General Assembly has condemned the invasion and called on Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine. Here's a look at key things to know about the conflict: POSSIBLE TALKS The Ukrainian president's office said Wednesday evening that the country's delegation was on its way to the second round of talks with Russia since the invasion began, but it didn't say when it was expected to arrive.  Vladimir Medinsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin's aide and the head of Russia's delegation, told reporters the Ukrainians were expected to arrive Thursday for the talks in the Brest region of Belarus, which borders Poland. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said earlier Wednesday that his country was ready for talks to resume, but he noted that Russia's demands hadn't changed and that he wouldn't accept any ultimatums. WHAT ABOUT VIOLENCE IN UKRAINE? Zelenskyy's office reported a powerful explosion Wednesday night between the Southern Railway Station and the Ibis hotel in Kyiv. Ukraine's Defense Ministry is located near that area.  Two cruise missiles hit a hospital in the northern city of Chernihiv, the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN quoted the city's chief health administrator, Serhiy Pivovar, as saying. The hospital's main building was damaged and authorities were working to determine the casualty toll, he said. And in Mariupol, at least one teenager died and two more were wounded by apparent Russian shelling. The boys' families said they had been playing soccer near a school. Russia's 40-mile-long (64-kilometer-long) convoy of tanks and other vehicles remains outside the capital, Kyiv. The city has has been struck by deadly shelling.  Russia says troops have taken the Ukrainian port city of Kherson. The Ukrainian military denies this. Russian forces have also been bombarding the country's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, and laid siege to two strategic seaports. WHAT IS THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION? U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi wrote on Twitter that an exodus of 1 million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries has unspooled over the past seven days. This amounts to more than 2% of Ukraine's population, though some of those fleeing Ukraine are citizens of other countries.  The U.N. agency has predicted that up to 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine, but cautioned that even that projection could be revised upward. The World Bank counted Ukraine's population at 44 million at the end of 2020. The EU Commission says it will give temporary residence permits to refugees fleeing the violence and allow them to study and work in the 27-nation bloc. The move would need the approval of member states, which have already expressed broad support. U.N. CONDEMNATION AND WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATION The U.N. General Assembly voted Wednesday to demand that Russia stop its offensive in Ukraine and withdraw all troops, with nations from world powers to tiny island states condemning Moscow. The vote was 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions. U.S. President Joe Biden said the vote ""demonstrates the extent of global outrage"" at Russia's assault on its neighbor. The resolution deplored Russia's ""aggression"" against Ukraine ""in the strongest terms."" General Assembly resolutions aren't legally binding. The International Criminal Court's prosecutor opened an investigation Wednesday into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Ukraine, dating back to 2013 and covering the current conflict. Prosecutor Karim Khan said he did so after 39 of the court's member states requested an investigation.  Ukraine and Russia, however, are not among the International Criminal Court's 123 member states. ARE SANCTIONS HURTING RUSSIA? In Washington, the White House announced additional sanctions against Russia and Belarus, including extending export controls that target Russian oil refining and entities supporting both countries' militaries. The U.S. is also joining Europe and Canada in closing off its airspace to Russian airlines. Additionally, Airbus and Boeing said they would cut off spare parts and technical support to the country's airlines. The French-based Airbus and U.S.-based Boeing's aircraft account for the vast majority or Russia's passenger fleet. The sanctions also threaten ultra-wealthy Russians who own properties across Europe and send their children to elite European private schools. Some have begun, albeit tentatively, to speak out. Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich confirmed Wednesday he's trying to sell the Premier League Chelsea soccer club, with a price tag of at least $2.5 billion floated. He said net proceeds from the sale will be donated to benefit all victims of the war in Ukraine.  Ordinary Russians are also feeling the impact of the sanctions, from payment systems that won't operate and problems withdrawing cash to not being able to purchase certain items. Also, in a stunning reversal, Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Paralympics Games for their countries' roles in the war in Ukraine. The International Paralympic Committee announced the about-face less than 24 hours after it had said it would allow the athletes to compete when the Games open on Friday as neutral athletes with colors, flags and other national symbols removed. ___ Follow the AP's coverage of the war between Russia and Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine  Read More One million Ukrainian refugees flee as Kherson falls to Russia -live Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

3330,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,14/4/2022,1274 words,Sam Blewett,PM braced for legal bids over forced removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda,"Ministers were braced for legal challenges over widely criticised plans to forcibly send to Rwanda up to tens of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive in the UK in unauthorised Channel crossings. Boris Johnson insisted his scheme to detain and fly migrants more than 4,000 miles to East Africa at the expense of the taxpayer was not ""draconian and lacking in compassion"". But both the Prime Minister and Priti Patel said on Thursday they were prepared to fight attempts to use the courts to block the plans heavily criticised by refugee charities. They would not detail how much the programme will cost, but the Home Secretary has struck a £120 million economic deal with Rwanda and cash for each removal is expected to follow. Labour accused the Prime Minister of trying to distract from the partygate scandal with the ""unworkable, unethical and extortionate"" migration scheme. Charities condemned them as ""cruel and nasty"" plans that will fail to address the issue and cause more ""suffering and chaos"", while criticising Rwanda's human rights track record. And protesters wielding signs with the message ""refugees welcome here"" gathered outside the Home Office, declaring their intention to ""fight back"" against the move. Battling to remain in power after being fined by police for breaching coronavirus laws, Mr Johnson tasked the Navy with ensuring ""no boat makes it to the UK undetected"". Officials expect thousands of migrants who entered by means deemed illegal, such as through the perilous Channel crossings, would be removed to Rwanda in the coming years. Giving a major speech in Kent, Mr Johnson said the agreement is ""uncapped"" and Rwanda will have the ""capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead"". He said the partnership will be ""fully compliant with our international legal obligations"", while insisting Rwanda is ""one of the safest countries in the world"". ""But nevertheless, we expect this will be challenged in the courts,"" Mr Johnson added, as he hit out at what he called a ""formidable army of politically motivated lawyers"". He said they have ""made it their business to thwart removals and frustrate the Government"" and have caused the UK to be ""seen as a soft touch for illegal migration by some of our partners"". ""So I know this system will not take effect overnight,"" Mr Johnson added. I Stephanie Boyce, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales that represents solicitors, warned there are ""serious questions"" about whether the plans comply with international law. ""It is particularly disappointing - this week of all weeks - the Government is repeating misleading suggestions that legal challenges are politically motivated,"" she said. ""If the government wishes to avoid losing court cases, it should act within the law of the land."" During a visit to the Rwandan capital of Kigali, Ms Patel was confident that she would be able to fend off legal challenges after coming under pressure to tackle Channel crossings. ""People actually said this will never happen and look at the work that has taken place to achieve this,"" she said. She said that the ""vast majority"" of those who arrive in the UK ""illegally"" will be detained and considered for relocation to Rwanda but declined to share specific details after it was reported it would only apply to male migrants. The number of people who can be relocated will be ""unlimited"", with the first due to receive formal notifications within weeks, and the first flights expected to take place in the coming months. Meanwhile, fresh arrivals reached the shore in Dover on Thursday, in what officials acknowledged was a busy day for crossings. It is thought the total number of migrants to have arrived on small boats so far this year has passed 5,000. Mr Johnson accepted the Rwanda deal is not a ""magic bullet"" that will solve the crossings alone. But he hopes it will break the business model of the ""vile people smugglers"" who risk turning the Channel into a ""watery graveyard"". British Red Cross executive director Zoe Abrams said the humanitarian network was ""profoundly concerned"" about the plans to ""send traumatised people halfway round the world to Rwanda"". ""We are not convinced this drastic measure will deter desperate people from attempting to cross the Channel either. People come here for reasons we can all understand, like wanting to be reunited with loved ones, or because they speak the language. Making it harsher may do little to stop them risking their lives,"" she said. Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon urged the Government to ""immediately rethink"" the ""cruel and nasty"" plans, warning they could cost up to £1.4 billion a year. ""Treating people like human cargo by using the force of military to repel vulnerable people who have already endured extreme human suffering, and expelling them to centres in Rwanda, a country with a questionable record on human rights, is dangerous, cruel and inhumane."" The policies will ""do little to deter desperate people from seeking protection or stop the smugglers but only lead to more human suffering, chaos and at huge expense to the UK"", he added. Labour MP Nadia Whittome, who attended the protest outside the Home Office, said the ""incredible"" turnout showed the Government had ""badly misjudged the mood of the country"" on the issue. She told the PA news agency: ""I think people's response to Afghan refugees, to Ukrainian refugees... people of this country have been so, so much more generous than this Government. ""I think most people agree that you know, it's not a Sudanese engineer who put up our energy prices by 54%. It's not a Syrian labourer who got rid of all our council homes and then didn't build any more. ""It's the fault of this Government that people are struggling. People don't have the lives that we deserve."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the plans ""unworkable"", ""extortionate"" and an attempt to distract from Mr Johnson being fined for breaching his own coronavirus laws. Ms Patel insisted the agreement with Rwanda does not hinge on the Nationality and Borders Bill, which is facing opposition in the House of Lords. Asked by the PA news agency, she said: ""No, no, it's not. It's not. ""So the whole principle of this agreement partnership that we have is not hinged on the Nationality and Borders Bill, let me be clear about that."" She said the Home Office is prepared for legal challenges, as she accused lawyers of ""fleecing the British taxpayer"". ""A lot of this is legal aid money that goes into the merry-go-round of claim after claim after claim,"" she added. But the costs of the Rwandan programme remained uncertain. The Home Office said the taxpayer would pay per person relocated, but would not say how much. As well as chartered flights for removal, it will pay for caseworkers, legal advice, translators, accommodation, food and healthcare for every person relocated. For those who successfully claim asylum in Rwanda, it will fund an integration package to help them put down roots. Mr Johnson pledged £50 million in new funding for boats, aerial surveillance and military personnel to help ensure the measures are a ""very considerable deterrent"" to crossings. And he said the individuals who succeed in making it to the UK ""will be taken not to hotels at vast public expense"" and instead will be housed in Greek-style detention centres, with the first opening at a former RAF barracks in North Yorkshire ""shortly"". Around 250 to 300 military personnel will be dedicated to police migrants in the English Channel on busy days, it is understood. They will work on ships and aircraft and will include Army personnel, freeing up Border Force staff for processing.",Broadsheet,0

Kawata, then 11, remembers understanding only two words they said: tokei, or wristwatch; and sake, which they went on to loot from the home. It was the beginning of the Soviet takeover of a resource-rich chain of islands in northern Japan, to the terror of families who had thought that the worst of the war was over after Japan's surrender. Japanese citizens were soon forbidden from working or moving freely, and women and children were detained for forced labour. Many families fled on boats in the middle of the night, rowing at first until they were far enough from the coast to turn on their engines. Kawata's family was among thousands displaced during that time. ""All these years later, I still can't forget everything I saw right before my eyes,"" Kawata, 87, says. Now, ""seeing the Ukrainians... it just hits so close to home. It doesn't seem like something happening in the distance."" Thousands of miles from Ukraine, in this city in the far northeast of Japan where many of the roughly 17,200 former residents of the Northern Territories resettled, the Russian invasion and the plight of millions of Ukrainian refugees resonate deeply. The war has crushed their hopes of ever seeing their homeland again after Russia broke off the negotiations over the islands in response to Japan's sanctions on Russia for invading Ukraine. For these former residents, whose average age is nearly 87, the hope of returning home in their lifetimes has vanished. ""The only ones left to tell these stories are just the recollections of some fifth-graders. The rest have all passed away, unable to share their stories,"" says Hiroshi Tokuno, 88, who fled Shikotan island at the age of 13. For years, under former prime minister Shinzo Abe, Japan sought to improve relations with Russia and to prioritise the peace treaty and territorial settlement in an effort to make Moscow a strategic partner and keep it from drawing closer to China. When Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014, concern over negotiations for the islands shaped Abe's tepid response. But in a dramatic turn away from its years of pursuing rapprochement with Russia, Japan has imposed wide-reaching economic sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Although negotiations had stalled since 2020, Moscow said last week that it had no intention of returning to talks and planned to end visa-free trips by Japanese citizens to the islands. It also threatened to withdraw from joint economic projects there. What Japan calls the Northern Territories - the islands of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Habomai and Shikotan - lie off the coast of Hokkaido, and some of them are visible from Nemuro on a clear day. They were part of Japan before the Second World War, but soon after the country surrendered in August 1945, the Soviet Union claimed the islands, which it called the Kuril Islands. These volcanic islands southeast of Russia's Sakhalin Island separate the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean, and are at the heart of post-war Russo-Japanese relations. The two countries made a joint declaration in 1956 ending the state of war between them, but have not signed a peace treaty. That has been awaiting a resolution of the dispute over the islands. From Japan's perspective, the Soviet seizure of the islands was a betrayal, because Japan had already surrendered, and the islands had been Japanese territory since the first treaty between the Russian empire and the empire of Japan in 1855, says James Brown, an expert in Russo-Japanese relations at Temple University's campus in Tokyo. For Russia, the islands are its rightful territories, obtained in exchange for joining the United States against Japan in the Second World War. Giving up the islands is considered a betrayal of Soviet soldiers and citizens as well as Russia's Second World War legacy, Brown says. The islands are also of strategic interest to Russia, because they make it easier for Moscow to get its ships into the Pacific Ocean from the Sea of Okhotsk, and have valuable natural resources, including a rare-earth metal used in aerospace construction. Tokyo and Moscow have held peace negotiations on and off since the 1956 declaration, but there has not been any significant movement. Unlike Japan's territorial disputes with China and South Korea over largely uninhabited islands, the scale of the dispute with Russia is different, because the islands are bigger (Etorofu is nearly 2,000 square miles) and thousands of people's lives are directly affected. In Nemuro, it's hard to travel a few blocks without seeing a massive statue or sign demanding, in uncharacteristically forceful Japanese language: ""The Northern Territories, give it back!"" Road signs and street names are written in Japanese and Russian, for the benefit of the Russian fishermen who do business in Nemuro. Here, Russia's announcement of its withdrawal from negotiations carries consequences. It prevents the former residents from visiting the graves of relatives on the islands. It also ends cultural visits between the islands' Russian residents and Japanese citizens, who hoped that the two populations could one day co-exist if the dispute were ever resolved. ""It is extremely unfair and unacceptable, undermining the efforts of the residents of both countries who have been working hard to promote an exchange,"" said Hokkaido governor Naomichi Suzuki in response to Russia's announcement. With Russia considering shutting down its economic agreement with Japan, the fishing industry is also on edge, because it relies on the waters between Japan and Russia. This area, where 3 million tonnes of fish and other seafood are caught annually, is considered one of the best places on the planet for fishing. Fewer than 5,500 former residents of the Northern Territories are still alive. They are clear-eyed about what Japan's tougher response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine means for the future of the negotiations over the islands, but some still support Japan's standing up to Russia. At the museum in Nemuro dedicated to the dispute, residents and visitors have left messages attacking Russian president Vladimir Putin and expressing solidarity with Ukraine. Some residents say they hope to see prime minister Fumio Kishida take a tougher approach with Russia to resolve the Northern Territories dispute. ""What Russia is doing in Ukraine, trying to change the status quo by force, can never be justified,"" says Yasuji Tsunoka, 84, who was 8 when Soviet forces took over the tiny island of Yuri, a part of the cluster of Habomai islets on which there were 70 homes. ""Kishida made strong sanctions, and we understand this. But we want now, more than ever, for negotiations to be direct and strong, without trying to constantly be sensitive of Russia,"" he says. ""The situation in Ukraine is once again an issue of territory, just like the northern islands with Japan."" After the Soviets took over the islands, some Japanese families remained for a few years, living alongside the Soviet families that had moved there. Tokuno recalls attending school with Soviet children, and his experience was later turned into an animated film for children called Giovanni's Island. But eventually, to make room for Soviet citizens, Japanese residents were displaced from their homes and pushed into sheds and horse stables. By October 1947, all Japanese remaining in the Northern Territories were taken off the islands in Soviet ships. That group included Tokuno, who recalls that they first withstood gruelling conditions in Sakhalin before making it to Nemuro. Some died on the journey. It wasn't until 1964 that Russia and Japan agreed to allow limited numbers of humanitarian trips to the islands so that former residents could visit their relatives' burial sites. The former residents say they hope future Japanese generations, as well as US leaders, will take up the fight. ""We will continue sharing the movement with the next generation to keep it going for as long as it takes,"" Tsunoka says. ""Japan must never stop."" © The Washington Post",Broadsheet,0
3342,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,8/3/2022,1269 words,Rachel Sharp,"A Hamptons pastry chef, a new bride and a father who won the green card lottery: The Ukrainians returning home from US to fight for their country","More than two million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes since Russia launched its full-scale attack on the country 13 days ago, according to the latest figures from the UN. In what has become the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War Two, women, children, and men who are not of fighting age are crossing the border into neighbouring countries -many bringing with them little more than the clothes on their backs. Poland has welcomed in around 1.2 million refugees so far, while some have traveled on to support networks in other parts of Europe and the US. On Thursday, the Biden administration announced that it would offer temporary protected status for Ukrainians, meaning that thousands of people already temporarily living or studying in the US can stay and work legally for 18 months rather than being forced to return to the war zone they used to call home. US Census estimates reveal that around 350,000 Ukrainian immigrants currently live in the US and this move could apply to around 75,000 of this group.  White House Press Secretary said the US was willing to take in Ukrainian refugees and around $54m has been given in aid to help those displaced by the war. But, while evacuations out of Ukraine continue and the US vows to take steps to support refugees, a growing number of Ukrainians are instead choosing to make the opposite journey with several waving goodbye to their lives in America to return home and fight for their country. Since the start of the war, over 140,000 Ukrainian citizens have made the journey back to Ukraine to volunteer in the fight against Russian forces, the State Guard Border Service said on Monday. While it is not clear how many of those traveled from the US, a pastry chef who worked in the Hamptons, a newlywed bride living in Chicago and a father who relocated to America to create a better life for his daughters are among those returning to Ukraine.   The Hamptons pastry chef  A pastry chef who runs a coffee shop in an affluent Hamptons community in New York state swapped his chef's whites for full body armour and crossed the border from Poland into Ukraine this week. Kristofer Kalas, owner of Hello Oma in East Hampton, told CBS News he has no military experience but is willing to die for his daughter's country. ""I want my child to have a Ukraine to go back to when she's grown up,"" he told the outlet as he walked along the border checkpoint dressed in full body armour. Mr Kalas is a US citizen who sees himself as a Ukrainian by marriage after marrying a Ukrainian woman. Before the war, the couple and their infant daughter used to split their time between New York and Ukraine. Mr Kalas said the family evacuated to Portugal where he left his wife and baby safe before returning to Ukraine alone. ""I am absolutely worried yes. But I am more worried for the people there who are not able to leave,"" he said. He added that Russia's threat that foreign fighters would not be protected under ""international humanitarian law"" did not concern him, because Russia has also disregarded humanitarian law in its treatment of Ukrainian civilians. ""As far as I can tell, they don't protect civilians under humanitarian law, so I don't put much credence in anything they say,"" he said. Mr Kalas grew up and went to school in East Hampton, where many of America's rich and famous including Alec Baldwin and Beyoncé have homes. After training as a private chef, Mr Kalas began producing his own chocolate before he opened Hello Oma in the area near where he grew up, according to a 2019 profile by local magazine Edible East End. His vision was for a coffee shop with baked goods, homemade chocolate and handmade pizza that had a focus on reducing waste. Now, he hopes not to engage in combat but to help out in Ukraine's defence where he can.  The new bride  A new bride who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Chicago for the last two decades boarded a flight to Europe two days after her wedding to join the fight for her home country. Maria married her husband David at a small ceremony in Oak Park on Saturday, where the roughly 20 guests were asked to donate medical supplies and other essential items for her to take to Ukraine instead of more traditional wedding gifts. On Monday, she planned to fly to Poland, before traveling on to the Ukrainian border where she will volunteer to fight for the country. ""I have to go. I can't do protests or fundraising or wave flags,"" she told the Associated Press. ""We've done this since 2015, Ukrainians, and I just can't do it anymore."" Her new husband David also plans to join her as soon as his passport is approved, as he said he wants to try to keep his wife safe and feels that ""complacency and compliance are pretty much the same thing"". ""You can only turn a blind eye to people being bullied for so long. And if it happens to them, it might be you next,"" he said. Maria grew up in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv until 1991 before her family moved to Poland. She then moved to Austria to study music, where she met her ex-husband who was from Chicago. She said they moved to his home town and she has lived there for the last 20 years, staying after they divorced. Maria and David met last year and became engaged in October. A local venue offered them a last-minute ceremony so they could wed before flying to Ukraine. It was a poignant date for their nuptials, marking her Ukrainian grandmother's birthday. Maria doesn't have any medical or military experience but is determined to support her country in whatever way she can if she is turned down from joining combat.  The father who won the green card lottery  A Ukrainian father who relocated to America to create a better life for his family after winning the green card lottery waved goodbye to his two daughters at Portland international airport in Oregon on Thursday to head to Ukraine. Sergey Korenev told The Guardian that he had been closely watching Russia's escalation on his country for months and decided he had to return to help within hours of the launch of the full-scale attack. ""When it became a total invasion, I felt like I needed to do something. I could not watch it from afar,"" he said. The 44-year-old was first heading to New York to collect donations and supplies from the Ukrainian community, then onto Poland to head to the border. He planned to rescue his mother from her home near Kyiv and evacuate her to safety in Poland before returning to join many of his friends who are already working as volunteers in the territorial defence force. The father-of-two spent his last day in the country they had made their home watching his youngest daughter Anna, 11, skateboard in a local park along with his eldest daughter Maria, 17. They then went with him to the airport where they had a tearful goodbye before their father boarded his plane -a small Ukrainian flag sticking out of his backpack. Back in 2014, Mr Korenev and his ex-wife Valentina launched a foundation to help Ukrainians fighting in Donetsk. Since moving to the US, he has worked as a driver for Uber and Doordash and has been enjoying America's craft beer scene, his brother told The Guardian. Despite winning the green card lottery, meaning the US can now be his permanent home, the 44-year-old was determined to head back to Ukraine in his country's hour of need. He said: ""I'm going there to help my friends, they are my brothers in arms.""",Broadsheet,1

Fitch said the war has raised risks to financial stability and could undermine Russia's ability to service its government debt. It said that, in turn, will weaken the country's finances and slow its economy, further raising geopolitical risks and uncertainty. Among other factors, the ratings agency noted sanctions imposed by Western countries that are limiting access to foreign currency needed to repay debt and purchase imports and increased uncertainty over Russia's willingness to pay such debts. ___ BEIJING - Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries' roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee said Thursday in Beijing. The about-face comes less than 24 hours after the IPC on Wednesday said it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete when the Games open on Friday, but only as neutral athletes with colors, flags and other national symbols removed. The IPC received immediate criticism for its initial decision. It was termed a betrayal that sent the wrong message to Russia's leadership. The IPC also said it was evident that many athletes would refuse to compete against Russians or Belarusians, creating chaos for the Paralympics. The IPC now joins sports like soccer, track, basketball, hockey and others that have imposed blanket bans on Russians and Belarusians. ___ SEOUL, South Korea - A South Korean pharmaceutical company manufacturing Russia's COVID-19 vaccine says it's bracing for business complications as the U.S.-led West escalates sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Recently expanded U.S. sanctions include targeted measures against the Russian Direct Investment Fund , a sovereign wealth fund run by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin that globally markets the Sputnik vaccines. Kim Gi-young, an official from Seoul-based GL Rapha, said the sanctions won't directly impede its production of the shots as the measures aren't aimed at essential medical supplies. However, the company is concerned about potential problems rising from the financial side as South Korea joins the United States and many European countries in a move to cut off key Russian banks from global payment systems. ""Right now, we are watching how the situation develops,"" Kim said. GL Rapha has so far produced 5 million shots of the single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine, but none of them have been used so far as Russia continues to delay rollout plans, Kim said. GL Rapha also has an agreement with RDIF to produce 150 million shots of the two-dose Sputnik V and is participating in a consortium of South Korean companies that has been contracted to produce another 500 million doses of Sputnik V, but these shots haven't been produced yet. RDIF has reportedly criticized the U.S. sanctions and said the measures would slow its promotion of Sputnik V. ___ DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - The United Arab Emirates says Ukrainian passport holders continue to be eligible for visas on arrival to the Gulf state. The UAE's Foreign Ministry statement on Thursday came in response to media coverage quoting Ukraine's Embassy in the UAE saying that the Gulf country is reimposing visa requirements on Ukrainians and suspending an agreement for visa-free travel between the two countries. The energy-rich UAE, which relies on Russian and Ukrainian wheat exports, is home to some 15,000 Ukrainian residents among its roughly 8 million foreign residents and 1 million Emirati citizens. Before the coronavirus pandemic, around a quarter-million Ukrainian tourists visited the UAE. The UAE, like other Gulf Arab states, does not recognize individuals fleeing war and has not permitted refugees from Syria, Iraq and other wars to seek asylum or seek resettlement. The UAE, which is home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, abstained in a U.N. Security Council vote late last week condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It is also chair of the Security Council. ___ MAZYR, Belarus - A string of seven bus-size Russian military ambulances - their windows blocked with gray shades - pulled up to the back entrance of the main hospital about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine on Tuesday evening, ferrying casualties from the front. The convoy was part of what residents and doctors said has in recent days become a steady flow of Russian soldiers wounded in fierce fighting around Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, where a Russian advance has stalled in the face of strong resistance. A doctor at the hospital - which is in southern Belarus's Gomel region, a main staging ground for Russia's offensive - said injured Russian troops began arriving on Monday. ""I hope they don't jail me for sharing this,"" she said. ___ WARSAW, Poland - The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe says one of its members died during shelling in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Maryna Fenina was killed while getting supplies for her family, the group said in a news release Wednesday. Fenina worked with the organization's monitoring mission in Ukraine. ""In Kharkiv and other cities and towns in Ukraine, missiles, shells and rockets are hitting residential buildings and town centers, killing and injuring innocent civilians - women, men and children alike,"" it said. The organization's chairperson, Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, and Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid extended their condolences. ""Our deepest condolences and sympathies go to Maryna's family. Maryna was a valued member of the SMM team, and our colleagues in Ukraine remain in close contact with her family to offer our support,"" it said. The organization launched its Ukraine monitoring mission in 2014 in response to a request from Ukraine's government and the consent of the group's 57 participating states. The mission observes and reports on the situation in Ukraine and aims to facilitate dialogue. ___ GENEVA - The U.N. refugee agency says 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia's invasion less than a week ago, an exodus without precedent in this century for its speed. The tally from UNHCR amounts to more than 2 percent of Ukraine's population on the move in under a week. The World Bank counted the population at 44 million at the end of 2020. The U.N. agency has predicted that up to 4 million people could eventually leave Ukraine but cautioned that even that projection could be revised upward. In an email, UNHCR spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams wrote: ""Our data indicates we passed the 1M mark"" as of midnight in central Europe, based on counts collected by national authorities. On Twitter, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, wrote: ""In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighboring countries."" Syria, whose civil war erupted in 2011, currently remains the country with the largest refugee outflows - at more than 5.6 million people, according to UNHCR figures. But even at the swiftest rate of flight by refugees out of Syria, in early 2013, it took at least three months for 1 million refugees to leave that country. UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo said Wednesday that ""at this rate"" the outflows from Ukraine could make it the source of ""the biggest refugee crisis this century."" ___ KYIV, Ukraine - In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an upbeat assessment of the war and called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance. ""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,"" he said. ""They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment."" Zelenskyy didn't comment on whether the Russians have seized several cities, including Kherson. ""If they went somewhere, then only temporarily. We'll drive them out,"" he said. He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who ""go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat."" ""These are not warriors of a superpower,"" he said. ""These are confused children who have been used."" He said the Russian death toll has reached about 9,000. ""Ukraine doesn't want to be covered in bodies of soldiers,"" he said.

3385,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,3/9/2022,1460 words,Holly Bancroft,Homes for Ukraine scheme hits ‘crisis point’ as councils brace for surge in homeless refugees,"Councils are bracing themselves for an influx of homeless refugees amid warnings that the government has “no plan” for the continuation of its flagship Homes for Ukraine scheme. With hosts facing increased pressure from the rising cost of living , many local authorities are worried that Ukrainian families will be left homeless when the initial six-month arrangements end. Refugees, hosts and councillors are also concerned about how Ukrainians will find independent accommodation in an increasingly competitive rental market.  In a snapshot survey of 64 councils, 61 per cent told The Independent that they were worried about an increasing number of Ukrainians presenting as homeless or being at risk of homelessness in the coming months. That was compared to 14 per cent who weren’t worried, and 25 per cent that didn’t respond.  Have you been involved in the Ukraine scheme? If so email holly.bancroft@independent.co.uk  The Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched on 14 March meaning the first refugees to arrive will reach the six-month mark during September.  Twenty-five per cent of sponsors said they only want to provide accommodation for six months or less, according to an ONS survey of 17,702 hosts. There are currently 86,100 Ukrainians in the UK under the scheme, 48,798 of which had arrived by the end of April.  “We’re going to see building pressures over the next few months and the government actually has no plan. There is zero plan or guidance coming out from the government,” Cllr Nesil Caliskan, leader of Enfield council, told The Independent. “If we waited for the government to act we would get to six months and we’d risk having loads of people homeless. So that’s why we’re planning our support now.” Cllr Caliskan said a “big concern” was the affordability and availability of private sector rentals, making it very hard for Ukrainian families to find accommodation. Cllr James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association which represents councils, urged the government to provide clarity on what happens next. “Councils, sponsors and Ukrainian guests all need to know what the options are at the end of the six-month initial placement period so they can start planning now.”  “There is a significant risk that -even if rematching is available -many Ukrainian families may need to present as homeless because of a lack of sponsors or other options,” he said. As of 29 July, 1335 households had presented as homeless to councils -635 of those were on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Analysis by Barnados, Labour and the Lib Dems predicts that between 15,000 and 21,000 Ukrainians could be homeless by winter, rising to more than 50,000 by the middle of next year. “Homes for Ukraine is a really strong scheme but the crisis point now is if we can’t get the refugees into independent housing,” Simone Schehtman, the lead pairer of Ukrainian refugees and hosts in Birmingham, said. “You go to the estate agent to try and get on the property ladder and the computer will just say no; you will fail the credit check and you won’t have a guarantor.” She urged ministers to allow local authorities to become guarantors of refugee’s rent and warned that if a plan was not put in place soon “six months of hard graft and good will by the British public and the government will become meaningless because we will have a haemorrhaging of homelessness”.  Alistair Carmichael MP, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said it would be “a tragedy” if any refugees were forced onto the streets, adding: “Ministers must act now.” Responding to the concerns, a government spokesperson said they disagreed that there was no plan for the future of the scheme. “The vast majority of sponsors want to provide support for longer than six months and we are working closely with councils to ensure all those who have fled Putin’s war have a safe place to live,” they said.  They emphasised that sponsors will continue to receive monthly £350 “thank you” payments for up to 12 months.  Inna Sukhoraba and her 16-year-old daughter Irynka are being sponsored by a host in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and have had trouble finding a place to rent for when their placement ends. Their host, Pilar, told The Independent: “Inna had found a place and was happy to pay six months rent in advance but then suddenly two days later the landlord decided to take somebody else. “It is very difficult for the Ukrainians who want to be independent and build their lives here. The government needs to give them support to move forward because they cannot be permanent guests. Where we live the rent is very expensive and one day flats come on the market, the next day they are gone. “As hosts, we feel that we have been sort of abandoned. They don’t have a plan for us or our guests and we are totally stuck.” Svitlana Stadnyk, who volunteers as a mediator between hosts and Ukrainians in partnerships with National Family Mediation, said she expected to see more cases in the coming months. “As the autumn comes, and as the six-month end approaches, there will be more and more people who need help resolving conflicts,” she said. “There are varying sources of tension and one is the rising cost of living. “Many hosts did not receive their thank you payments in time and they are seeing their utility prices go up going into the winter.” The government provides councils with a £10,500 support fund for each refugee on the Homes for Ukraine scheme, however, they have not yet committed to continuing the payments past 12 months -leaving local authorities unsure where the money will come from after the first year. Barnsley metropolitan borough council said it was worried about the six-month deadline, primarily due to lack of affordable, available accommodation, while Hampshire County Council said it was seeing “increasing pressure” on its services due to the number of arrangements coming to an end. East Suffolk Council said that it was concerned that the six-month mark would come at a time when families were facing challenges managing the increased cost of living, while Tandrige District council said it was worried its homeless prevention service would not be able to cope with the increased demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up said: “In the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. “All arrivals have access to benefits from day one and we are giving councils an extra £10,500 per person to cover any extra costs.”  ‘I simply could not survive the third night’  On the third night of the war, Inna decided she and her daughter Irynka need to leave. They had been staying with Inna’s parents in Berdychiv, Zhytomyr region and sat listening to the Russian planes flying over their home, petrified that bombs would fall on them.  “The first two nights Russian planes were flying over us and we didn’t know if they were going to drop bombs on us or not. I realised I simply could not survive the third night, so my daughter and I got on the train to Poland,” she said. While in Poland, she and her daughter found a placement under the Homes for Ukraine scheme but they always knew it would just be for six months. “I like British people and British culture and I am afraid to go back to Ukraine,” she told The Independent. Now, four months into the arrangement, she is trying to find a place where she can live independently. “I was a project manager for the Bank of Ukraine but now it is difficult for me here. For example, I found accommodation for my daughter and I and the first landlord agreed that we could rent the place but then something changed and she changed her mind.” “Where we live rent is very expensive to start with,” her host Pilar said. “The flats they are looking for, one day it comes on the market, the next it is gone.” “The Thank you payments that the government gives to the host, why can’t they give that to the Ukrainians who want to be independent?” she suggested. Inna is keen to find work in the UK but has struggled due to the language barrier. “I’m working on improving my English and I’m starting a business,” she said. “When I arrived in the UK, British people told me they liked my Ukrainian style and so I thought I could make Ukrainian dresses and sell them here.” She is financially supporting her sister and her parents back home in Ukraine and still has to pay for the utilities at her Kyiv flat. She is hoping that she will be able to support herself by selling clothes and went to her first market last week. “The main goal for my business is to support the Ukrainian economy, as well as preserve and spread our culture while I am abroad.”",Broadsheet,1
3392,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,3/3/2022,1516 words,Via AP news wire,Refugee count tops 1 million; Russians besiege Ukraine ports," The number of people sent fleeing Ukraine by Russia 's invasion topped 1 million on Wednesday, the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations said, as Russian forces kept up their bombardment of the country's second-biggest city, Kharkiv , and laid siege to two strategic seaports. The tally from the U.N. refugee agency released to The Associated Press amounts to more than 2% of Ukraine's population being forced out of the country in less than a week. The mass evacuation could be seen in Kharkiv, where residents desperate to get away from falling shells and bombs crowded the city's train station and tried to press onto trains, not always knowing where they were headed. In a videotaped address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up the resistance. He vowed that the invaders would have ""not one quiet moment"" and described Russian soldiers as ""confused children who have been used."" Moscow's isolation deepened when most of the world lined up against it at the United Nations to demand it withdraw from Ukraine. And the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into possible war crimes. With fighting going on on multiple fronts across the country, Britain's Defense Ministry said Mariupol, a large city on the Azov Sea, was encircled by Russian forces, while the status of another vital port, Kherson , a Black Sea shipbuilding city of 280,000, remained unclear. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces claimed to have taken complete control of Kherson, which would make it the biggest city to fall yet in the invasion. A senior U.S. defense official disputed that. ""Our view is that Kherson is very much a contested city,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Zelenskyy's office told the AP that it could not comment on the situation in Kherson while the fighting was still going on. The mayor of Kherson, Igor Kolykhaev, said Russian soldiers were in the city and came to the city administration building. He said he asked them not to shoot civilians and to allow crews to gather up the bodies from the streets. ""We don't have any Ukrainian forces in the city, only civilians and people here who want to LIVE,"" he said in a statement later posted on Facebook. The mayor said Kherson would maintain a strict 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and restrict traffic into the city to food and medicine deliveries. The city will also require pedestrians to walk in groups no larger than two, obey commands to stop and not to ""provoke the troops."" ""The flag flying over us is Ukrainian,"" he wrote. ""And for it to stay that way, these demands must be observed."" Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko said the attacks there had been relentless. ""We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from houses and apartments today, since the shelling does not stop,"" he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. Russia reported its military casualties for the first time since the invasion began last week, saying nearly 500 of its troops have been killed and almost 1,600 wounded. Ukraine did not disclose its own military losses but said more than 2,000 civilians have died, a claim that could not be independently verified. In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Zelenskyy praised his country's resistance. ""We are a people who in a week have destroyed the plans of the enemy,"" he said. ""They will have no peace here. They will have no food. They will have here not one quiet moment."" He said the fighting is taking a toll on the morale of Russian soldiers, who ""go into grocery stores and try to find something to eat.""  ""These are not warriors of a superpower,"" he said. ""These are confused children who have been used."" Meanwhile, the senior U.S. defense official said an immense column of hundreds of tanks and other vehicles appeared to be stalled roughly 25 kilometers (16 miles) from Kyiv and had made no real progress in the last couple of days. The convoy, which earlier in the week had seemed poised to launch an assault on the capital, has been plagued with fuel and food shortages, the official said. On the far edges of Kyiv, volunteers well into their 60s manned a checkpoint to try to block the Russian advance. ""In my old age, I had to take up arms,"" said Andrey Goncharuk, 68. He said the fighters needed more weapons, but ""we'll kill the enemy and take their weapons."" Around Ukraine, others crowded into train stations, carrying children wrapped in blankets and dragging wheeled suitcases into new lives as refugees.  In an email, U.N. refugee agency spokesperson Joung-ah Ghedini-Williams told the AP that the refugee count surpassed 1 million as of midnight in central Europe, based on figures collected by national authorities. Shabia Mantoo, another spokesperson for the agency, said that ""at this rate"" the exodus from Ukraine could make it the source of ""the biggest refugee crisis this century."" A large explosion shook central Kyiv on Wednesday night in what the president's office said was a missile strike near the capital city's southern railway station. There was no immediate word on any deaths or injuries. Russian forces pounded Kharkiv, Ukraine's biggest city after Kyiv, with about 1.5 million people, in another round of aerial attacks that shattered buildings and lit up the skyline with flames. At least 21 people were killed over the past day, said Oleg Sinehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional administration. Several Russian planes were shot down over Kharkiv, according to Oleksiy Arestovich, a top adviser to Zelenskyy. ""Kharkiv today is the Stalingrad of the 21st century,"" Arestovich said, invoking what is considered one of the most heroic episodes in Russian history, the five-month defense of the city from the Nazis during World War II. From his basement bunker, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov told the BBC: ""The city is united and we shall stand fast.'' Russian attacks, many with missiles, blew the roof off Kharkiv's five-story regional police building and set the top floor on fire, and also hit the intelligence headquarters and a university building, according to officials and videos and photos released by Ukraine's State Emergency Service. Officials said residential buildings were also hit, but gave no details. The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency warned that the fighting poses a danger to Ukraine's 15 nuclear reactors. Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency noted that the war is ""the first time a military conflict is happening amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power program,"" and he said he is ""gravely concerned."" Russia already has seized control of the decommissioned Chernobyl power plant, the scene in 1986 of the world's worst nuclear disaster. In New York, the U.N. General Assembly voted to demand that Russia stop its offensive and immediately withdraw all troops, with world powers and tiny island states alike condemning Moscow. The vote was 141 to 5, with 35 abstentions.  Assembly resolutions aren't legally binding but can reflect and influence world opinion. The vote came after the 193-member assembly convened its first emergency session since 1997. The only countries to vote with Russia were Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea. Cuba spoke in Moscow's defense but ultimately abstained. Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya said Russian forces ""have come to the Ukrainian soil, not only to kill some of us ... they have come to deprive Ukraine of the very right to exist."" He added: ""The crimes are so barbaric that it is difficult to comprehend."" Russia ramped up its rhetoric. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reminded the world about the country's vast nuclear arsenal when he said in an interview with Al-Jazeera that ""a third world war could only be nuclear."" In other developments: - A second round of talks aimed at ending the fighting was expected Thursday, but there appeared to be little common ground between the two sides. - The price of oil continued to soar, reaching $112 per barrel, the highest since 2014. - Airbus and Boeing said they would cut off spare parts and technical support to the country's airlines, a major blow. Airbus and Boeing jets account for the vast majority or Russia's passenger fleet.  ___ Isachenkov and Litvinova reported from Moscow; Karmanau reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Mr Trump accused the congressman of ""going woke"" in a lengthy statement this morning. He raised the possibility of retracting his endorsement in a recent interview, after which Mr Brooks released an ad boasting of his appearance at the rally outside the White House before the 6 January Capitol riot. And on another front, Mr Trump and his children Donald Jr and Ivanka have filed an appeal in their fight against the New York attorney general's attempt to depose them as part of a civil investigation into the Trump Organization. Ms Trump has stepped up in the effort to support Ukrainian refugees by sending 1 million meals to Poland for distribution through charitable partners and aid workers on the ground there and in Ukraine.

3429,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,24/7/2022,2879 words,Mark Beaumont,Jamie T: ‘I hated education. I think public schools should be banned’,"Jamie T is telling me to f*** off. We’re discussing his five-year absence from music, and at first he mulls it over in an introverted mumble. “You go quiet for ages, you gamble everything,” he says, head lowered over a pub table. “Because if you go quiet for ages, then you release something that’s s***, or worse, something that just falls between the cracks – that's a lot of pressure. A lot of pressure on a single human being.” In an instant, his eyes widen, full of fight-back fury. Because when Jamie T turns on you, it’s like a horror movie jump scare. It’s a wolf cornered, Gollum un-ringed, the devil inside showing its face mid-exorcism. “So when you say do I enjoy the mystique? I’d say f*** off. Yeah? F*** off.” Ever since “Sheila”’s melodic parade of drunks, dealers and addicts established him as the most renowned rap-punk troubadour of the urban sprawl back in 2006, the now 36-year-old Jamie Treays has developed something of a reputation for being prickly with the press. How much of his sporadic antagonism is an affectation, a defence mechanism or simply toying with interviewers for sport is hard to quantify. A decade since our last beer together, Treays greets me warmly outside a Covent Garden pub, more bearded and bespectacled than when last we met, but his endearing nose-wheeze of a laugh still ever-ready. Taking a corner table, we small-talk about his ambitions to play in South America and his recent live comeback, warming up at west London’s Subterania for 600 fans before headlining the John Peel stage at Glastonbury, opposite Paul McCartney. If Macca was there as the boomers’ generational icon, Treays held a similar position for the millennials onsite. His electric, motormouth bursts of rabid street poetry and bare-boned urban ballads, incorporating punk, soul, folk and rap, epitomised the fast-evolving excitement of the early streaming era; in the indie-pop sphere, tracks such as “Calm Down Dearest” and “Sticks and Stones” have become revered modern texts. “It was only the second gig we’ve done in five, six years,” he says. “The second gig, going to headline the John Peel stage, that’s insane, it’s a complete whirlwind. It was just a bit of a shock to the system. I was quite worried about how we were gonna pull a crowd at all but the tent was rammed out. I was saying to my friend the other day, theoretically, I’ve played on the same bill as one of The Beatles.” Between the stage fright and the relief, though, he didn’t hang around to celebrate. “I went home after that. When I play gigs, especially ones that are high pressure, I’m such a bag of nerves I don’t want to hang around beforehand, and afterwards I'm so happy if it goes well that I just want to get out before I make a fool of myself.”  But when talk turns to the stresses of returning, six years on from his acclaimed fourth album Trick, particularly for an artist whose 2007 debut Panic Prevention outlined his deep-rooted anxiety issues, he begins to snap back. Over the next hour he’ll shift between amenable and combative, leaping by turns for the jocular and the jugular. Trigger topics include politics, British identity, class and the pandemic (“a terrible time, probably the worst time of my life, but I'm not gonna talk about it…I’m glad it’s over”). He’ll wind up the tension with a barbed retort to a question he doesn’t like: “I’m alternative? How f***ing dare you, you f***ing b****!”. Or: “What do I make of [Partygate]? I don’t f**ing give a s***… Don’t talk to me about stupid s*** like that”. Then he’ll defuse it with a belly laugh or good-natured about-turn – “I’m only joking, it’s an interview!”, “I’m just parrying with you, this is my job man” – and ask for the question again.  On the topic of the mystique that develops during lengthy breaks, for instance, he warms. “I got brought up in a way, with my management company and s***, to not do anything until you think it’s really good,” he explains. “So don’t put anything f***ing blasé out just to keep your momentum going, stop and take the time and release something that’s good. That does come with a stipulation, a point that I didn't read in the small print: you’re gonna spend quite a lot of time with people going, ‘What are you doing?’… I'd much rather have my life where I was releasing music on a regular basis. The mystique thing is a fallacy. It’s actually very hard to deal with not releasing records as often as other people. There’s nothing I enjoy about that at all.”  If Treays is worried about his fifth album, The Theory of Whatever, falling through the cracks, his fears are misplaced. Just as he returned after a previous five-year hiatus with 2014’s inspired and exploratory Carry on the Grudge, this is an auspicious and wide-ranging comeback, taking in hallucinogenic ballroom ballads (“Thank You”), barrelling pop songs that sound like The Smiths going emo (“A Million and One Ways to Die”) and gothic synth raps akin to The Cure writing their distorted version of a John Hughes movie theme (“’90s Cars”).  Thematically, it bristles with Treays’s customary tales of love and youth broken on the grinding wheels of modern life – the heartbreaks, the drink and drugs, the metropolitan dislocation. In framing such tales, though, Treays casts an even broader eye across the span of society in 2022 than masterpieces like Panic Prevention and Kings And Queens did more than 10 years ago. He peeks through the designer window blinds of “St George Wharf Tower” and the “oligarch’s houses” of “Keying Lamborghinis” as astutely as he dredges the gutter on “British Hell”, an Arctic Monkeys-like surf-rock portrait of the violence and brutality of street life, its chorus borrowed from The Misfits’ “London Dungeon” and sung by ex-Gallows frontman Frank Carter.  At the phrase “urban deprivation”, though, Treays rankles. “That’s not what I’ve been writing about at all. Just because I’m talking about people getting drunk doesn’t mean I’m talking about urban degradation and decay. I’m an upper middle-class boy from f***ing Wimbledon, I’m not talking about urban degradation. I’m talking about people going out and getting p***ed. If I want to talk about urban deprivation I’d do it in ‘British Hell’, which I f***ing did.”   I’m an upper middle-class boy from f***ing Wimbledon, I’m not talking about urban degradationJamie TSo there are songs about urban deprivation. “Well no,” he protests. “What I’m talking about in that song is I’m talking about… I’m talking about…alright, you’re right. Hahaha! You got me! One-nil.” It’s a song that seems to be about the disintegration of British society. Has Brexit divided us to that extent? “No, Brexit made us divided [but] since Covid I think we are more unified now than we were before. Before that there was a lot of heavy s*** going on. These people were changing the country and f***ing s*** up. Do you remember how much everyone was at each other’s [throats]? Do you remember how bad it was when that s*** was going on? Covid came about and… I think the country is more solidified now than it was before Brexit, because everyone is in trouble now. Brexit brought factions between us all and people fighting, factions between everyone, old things started to rehash. And sadly, some of these things were just so misplaced, so unfortunately misplaced. People got f***ed over to f***…The people who voted for that were not all f***ing racists. They were f***ing normal people who were struggling in places that were ignored. And they were led by a f***ing dude who only wanted a f***ing referendum because he couldn’t keep his f***ing party in f***ing line, and then we all got f***ed by it.”Treays, by the way, says “f***” a lot. Particularly when riled. Head lowered, voice simmering with anger, he side-tracks into an impassioned diatribe against “f***ing idiot” David Cameron and “f***ing lunatic” Tony Blair, punctuated by pint-rattling thumps of the table. “Those two people don't deserve the respect of this country…That is why David Cameron has disappeared, because he knows he doesn’t deserve our respect. He gambled the nation on the fact he couldn’t keep his party in line. That is what you call a fassyhole.” Treays was a new recruit to the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn (“There was a moment of feeling like it may have happened, there was a flutter there”). Unsurprisingly, then, he's no fan of Boris Johnson either. “I think the fact that he wrote two essays, one against Brexit and one for Brexit, proved the point that the man just wanted power,” he argues (we’re speaking on the eve of Johnson’s resignation). “He used Brexit to get into power and I think he had no intention of making the country better, at all. Next question.” Is there a British identity now? Treays thinks not, unless Gogglebox or Love Island is on. “There’s an identity in solidarity…Those are the very rare occasions when we all feel we identify together. That is important, that’s what we’ve lost a bit. Everyone feeling solidarity together. The Ukraine conflict has somehow galvanised a lot of people. My mother and father are taking Ukrainian refugees in. It galvanised a lot of love in the country, a lot of hope in the country. I think we miss each other as a nation. We miss each other as classes, we miss each other as southerners and northerners and Midlanders. Everyone is yearning to connect and the only thing we have are these small little moments on the telly or the internet. There’s a disconnect and any moment – the Jubilee and stuff like that – is so important.” So, is the cost of living crisis going to exacerbate the class divide, with the rich able to soak it up and the poor slipping further behind? “And then you’ve got the middle class…” Who are struggling too, I point out. Treays balks at the interruption. “Well, I must be completely out of that. I’m getting a chopper in a minute out of here, you f***ing d***. Don’t talk to me like I don’t f***ing know about this s***. Of course, it’s everywhere. Don’t try and talk to me about what I think about the cost of living crisis. I look after my neighbours, yeah? I look after my f***ing neighbours and my neighbours look after me. I’m not gonna talk to you about how that goes, but I’ve walked into people’s houses, my neighbours, and looked after them at bad moments. Don’t f***ing talk to me like I’m some f***ing Rolling Stone and I’m going to Paris.” A sore point, perhaps, class. In his earliest years in music, Treays existed in a strange societal hinterland. He was attending public school by day and hanging around in car park boozers with teen punk tearaways by night, or singing songs about them in pubs and clubs.My mother and father are f***ing great human beings who worked their a***s off to send me where I [went] and I will f***ing fight anyone on the f***ing street who wants to have a problem with that. I will fight you on the street Jamie T “I hated education,” he says. “I think [public schools] should be banned. I’m proud of my mum and dad, I’m proud of the fact that they sent me there – I’m as dumb as f***ing pigs***, man. I’m dumb as pigs***…I didn’t like it, it wasn’t a terribly nice experience for me, I just didn’t like education. I do not believe in private schools because I don’t believe anyone should be educated any different from anyone else. I don’t believe that you should pay for education. My mother and father are f***ing great human beings who worked their a***s off to send me where I [went] and I will f***ing fight anyone on the f***ing street who wants to have a problem with that. I will fight you on the street.”  Within seconds, Treays has rolled down his metaphorical sleeves and is wistfully wishing to be Paul Heaton, “the best songwriter of all f***ing time”, guffawing like the best of pub mates. It’s the sort of lovable mood swing his new album pulls off too. Several songs toward the end of the record tackle feelings of aimlessness and confusion: “Between the Rocks” (not a crack reference, Treays is at pains to point out) and “Talk is Cheap”, an amorphous acoustic confessional about feeling “rudderless” in a post-break-up malaise characterised by “dirty sleeping round” and “doing too much coke”. They are the result of “a lost period” when Treays “didn’t know quite what I was doing”, but pulled through creatively thanks to the support of a circle of musician friends including Carter, Carl Barat of The Libertines, Yannis Philippakis of Foals, Matt Maltese, ex-Maccabees Orlando Weeks and Hugo White, Audio Bullys’ Tom Dinsdale, Willie J Healy and The Prodigy’s Olly Burden, many of whom ended up on the album. Surprisingly, rather than old acquaintances from the Noughties, these are mostly new friends, drawn into Treays’ orbit as he worked on as many as 200 demos over the past five years.  “I’m a singular singer-songwriter and it can be quite a lonely place,” he says. “I don’t have a band so it’s lonely. But through the kindness and love of these people being kind to me, I’ve managed to envelop a lot of f***ing people in my world, and it's really wonderful. From me annoying them with tracks every day or whatever, annoying them with demos, I've managed to actually build a little community around me of these bods that I love. I love all of their music and they’re all constant inspirations. When I played the gig the other day, they all came down. It’s mad seeing them all in a room together, all posturing off and peacocking each other. I was an outlander before, but I suppose I always wanted to be in a band, I always wanted mates [and] I found my tribe years later. It’s just wonderful.”  “Sabre Tooth” transposes the same sense of disorientation to a fictional victim of the migrant crisis. “It’s about refugees going from f***ing Syria and coming up to Calais, and by the time they get to Calais everyone’s fronting them off and saying ‘No, f*** off’” – Treays slams the table – “and they have to go back to their f***ing home after you’ve smashed the s*** out of it. We are responsible for these people migrating across the place and we are ethnically cleansing people by allowing wars to go on and let people be in situations where they are transient and not being protected, and that is awful.”  Then, with a mischievous twist, the album ends on “50,000 Unmarked Bullets”, the imagined romantic turmoil of Kim Jong-un. Seriously.  Treays grins broadly. “I wanted to make you feel sorry for Kim Jong-un, yeah? The whole idea of the song was ‘my father was a despot so I had to be a despot’. It was like a musical – haha! – trying to make you feel sorry for somebody that’s a dictator. I envisioned his life at the baccalaureate school in Switzerland, which he went to, I looked it all up. And I wrote a song about him falling in love with a girl and then having to be like, ‘Oh, I have to go home because my father’s dying and I have to kill my uncles’.” The song imagines Jong-un being tried in The Hague, but more worried about his girlfriend reading the transcripts from every bugged room he’s ever been in. “He’s more concerned with what his girlfriend thinks about him, and the transcripts never quite show the love they felt.” Despite having weathered one half-decade break from releasing music before, Treays admits to having no confidence that anybody would be listening after such a long time away trying to write “something that makes me want to stand up for myself – not be shy, not be a wallflower. Something that I believe in.” As conversation turns to the struggles faced by alternative acts in the streaming age, he even starts numbering his own days in music.  “I got into this f***ing game when I was 19 years old,” he says. “I wrote ‘Sheila’ when I was 17 years old. I’m 36 years old, I’m still on the same f***ing record deal. This is my last album for the record label. How many years is that?” Seventeen years, I calculate. “I’ve been on the same contract for 17 years of my life. I’m an old man. In indie music, you have to imagine what it’s like for me.”  Look at The National… “I don’t give a f***, I’m not in The National. I’m old. I’m nearly done, man.”  You’re going to give up? “I’m not giving up. I’ve done pretty well for myself, man. I’m just being real about where I am at, trying to be understanding of where I am in things. I don’t know how long I’m gonna carry on with it because I don’t know how long I’m gonna write any music that’s gonna be good.”  I suggest, then, that Treays is driven by the artistic imperative, that he’ll keep going for as long as he believes he’s making great records. Again, he balks. “No, it’s to do with the charts and s***. It’s to do with money, you d***head. It’s to do with money. I want to be able to pay my mortgage, of course it’s to do with money, you idiot. Of course it is. Because otherwise I need to get another job, because I have to pay my mortgage, because I don’t want to lose my f***ing house. Don’t treat me any different to anyone who has a f***ing job because I pay a f***ing mortgage and it’s the same for anyone.”  A conversation, we decide, for another pub, another time. He needn’t worry though: on the evidence of The Theory of Whatever, the Treays dynasty is secured for at least another half-decade.  ‘The Theory of Whatever’ is out now ",Broadsheet,0
3445,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,28/4/2023,5307 words,Arpan Rai and William Mata,"Russia-Ukraine news – live: Putin fires barrage of missiles on Kyiv, air defence activated across country","Ukraine activated air defence systems and sounded air raid alerts across the country after Russia fired another barrage of missiles towards the besieged nation in the early hours today. “Air defences are at work!” Kyiv ’s regional administration wrote on the Telegram amid explosions heard in the region. “Keep calm! Stay in shelters until the air alarm goes off!” Blasts have been reported in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy so far. Locals were seen taking shelter in metro stations after the whole country came under air raid alert. The air raid alert was sounded around 3.40am local time today and it is still on. Serhii Shaikhet, the head of Ukrainian city Mykolaiv’s police, had warned that Russia may try to strike Ukraine with up to a hundred missiles and overnight, Ukraine’s presidential office head Andriy Yermak had urged citizens not to ignore air raid sirens. The barrage of missiles comes just two days after a similar attack by Vladimir Putin ’s forces on Ukraine killed at least 23 people, including four children, after a Russian missile struck a nine-storey residential building.  Key Points   Putin’s soldiers ‘likely’ put in holes in the ground as punishment for misdemeanors Russia vows harsh response after Poland embassy school ‘seizure’ Moscow blames Ukraine for major Crimea oil depot fire Ukraine says more than 10 oil tanks destroyed by Crimea blast Ukraine controls key supply route into Bakhmut, military says   Barrage of missile fired over Kyiv, air defence activated  Air raid alerts have been issued throughout all of Ukraine by emergency services after a threat of missile strikes in the early hours today.  “The threat of a missile strike!” Kyiv’s regional administration wrote on the Telegram. “Stay in shelters.” Andriy Yermak, head of president Volodymyr Zelensky’s office, said on the Telegram, “Take care of your safety, do not publicise the work of air defence.”  Ukrainian defenders oust Russian forces from some positions in Bakhmut  Ukrainian counterattacks have ousted Russian forces from some positions in the besieged eastern city of Bakhmut, but the situation remains “difficult”, a top Ukrainian general said in comments released Monday. During the past few months the battle for Bakhmut has become the fulcrum of a conflict that has seen little shift in front lines since late last year, leaving both sides looking for a breakthrough. “The situation is quite difficult,” said Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of ground forces, in a statement on Telegram. “At the same time, in certain parts of the city, the enemy was counterattacked by our units and left some positions.” Syrskyi made the remarks while visiting front-line troops on Sunday, the military said. He added that new Russian units, including paratroopers and fighters from the Wagner mercenary group, were being “constantly thrown into battle” despite taking heavy losses. “But the enemy is unable to take control of the city,” Syrskyi said. Russian forces have steadily made incremental gains in Bakhmut, but a Ukrainian military spokesman said on Sunday it was still possible to supply the defenders with food, ammunition and medicine. Ukraine said on Monday its forces had repelled more than 36 enemy attacks on the part of the eastern frontline that stretches from Bakhmut to Maryinka, just west of Donetsk. Kyiv is preparing to mount a widely expected counteroffensive to retake swathes of territory in the east and south that was occupied by Russian forces following the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special military operation”, 15 months ago.  Ukrainian warehouses reportedly storing ammunition hit  Warehouses reportedly storing ammunition at a railway depot have been struck by Russian missiles in the Ukrainian city of Pavlohrad, it is understood. The aim seemed to be to hamper Kyiv’s preparations for its counteroffensive, which is set to launch soon. A video posted on social media shows secondary detonations and a blaze where the strike hit. This comes as missiles were launched by Russian strategic bombers against Ukrainian cities overnight. The Ukrainian military reported air defence had shot down 15 out of 18 missiles launched by Russia in the early hours of Monday morning.  Russia fortifying Crimea amid fears of Ukraine’s major breakthrough – UK MoD  The recent defences erected by Vladimir Putin’s forces highlight deep concern running among Russian leaders that Ukraine could achieve a major breakthrough, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. “Since summer 2022, Russia has constructed some of the most extensive systems of military defensive works seen anywhere in the world for many decades. These defences are not just near the current front lines but have also been dug deep inside areas Russia currently controls,” the MoD said in its latest intelligence update. It pointed to the imagery of Russia’s particular effort to fortify the northern border of occupied Crimea, including with a multi-layered defensive zone near the village of Medvedevka. “Russia has also dug hundreds of miles of trenches well inside internationally recognised Russian territory including in the Belgorod and Kursk regions,” the ministry said.  It added: “However, some works have likely been ordered by local commanders and civil leaders in attempts to promote the official narrative that Russia is ‘threatened’ by Ukraine and Nato.”  All missiles directed at Kyiv destroyed, says Ukraine  All missiles directed at the capital were destroyed, Kyiv’s city officials wrote on Telegram. “According to (preliminary information), no casualties among the civilian population and no destruction of residential facilities or infrastructure have been recorded,” the city administration said. Air defence systems were also called into action to shield the Kyiv region, which is a separate administrative entity from the city, from Russian missiles, officials said. Ukrainian media also reported blasts in the Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy regions.  Ukraine shoots down 15 out of 18 Russian missiles fired overnight  Ukrainian air defence has shot down 15 out of 18 missiles launched by Russia in the early hours today.  “Around 2.30am (1130 GMT), the Russian invaders attacked Ukraine from strategic aviation planes,” the country’s commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces Valerii Zaluzhnyi said on Telegram.  It added that 15 out of the 18 missiles launched had been destroyed. Russia fired cruise missiles of Ð¥-101/Ð¥-555 types on Ukraine, commander Zaluzhnyi said.  Czech president offers support to Ukraine  Petr Pavel, president of the Czech Republic, has been in Ukraine over the weekend.  The Ukraine defence ministry tweeteed: “After the events of 1968, the Czechs were left to fend for themselves for more than 20 years, all because no one came to their aid. “Ukraine has over 50 partner countries supporting it. The Russians will be pushed out much faster.”  Slovy literatury je prezident @ZelenskyyUa malý velký muž. Přesně věděl, kdy a jak svůj národ podpořit, i když to vypadalo ztraceně.

The celebration provided the visual highlight of Francis' three-day visit that has been dominated by the Vatican's concern for the plight of migrants and the war in neighboring Ukraine.Vatican involved in secret Ukraine peace mission, says Pope04:48 , Arpan Rai Pope Francis has confirmed the Vatican’s direct involvement in a peace mission to try to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.“I am willing to do everything that has to be done. There is a mission in course now but it is not yet public. When it is public, I will reveal it,” the Pope told reporters during a flight home after a three-day visit to Hungary.“I think that peace is always made by opening channels. You can never achieve peace through closure. ... This is not easy.”The Pope added that he had spoken about the situation in Ukraine with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban and with Metropolitan (bishop) Hilarion, a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Budapest.“In these meetings we did not just talk about Little Red Riding Hood. We spoke of all these things. Everyone is interested in the road to peace,” he said.Ukraine says it still holds parts of Bakhmut04:25 , Arpan Rai Ukraine’s troops are holding onto parts of the eastern city of Bakhmut, focus of a prolonged Russian assault, while the head of a major pro-Moscow force said his men were making progress.“Fierce fighting continues in the city of Bakhmut. The enemy is unable to take control over the city, despite throwing all its forces into the battle and having some success,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar.“The defence of Bakhmut is coping with its military tasks,” she said in a Telegram post. The Ukrainian military does not reveal exactly how much of the city is in Russian hands.Russian forces, which have struggled for months to capture Bakhmut, are slowly taking over more and more of the city.On Sunday, Russian defence ministry has said its forces had taken four blocks in the western direction in Bakhmut. And, Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, told the ICTV channel it was still possible to supply the Bakhmut defenders with food, ammunition and medicine and evacuate the wounded.Vatican involved in ‘secret peace mission'04:00 , William Mata Pope Francis said Sunday the Vatican was willing to help facilitate the return of Ukrainian children taken to Russia during the war, saying the Holy See had already helped mediate some prisoner exchanges and would do “all that is humanly possible” to reunite families.“All human gestures help. Gestures of cruelty don’t help,” Francis said during an airborne press conference en route home from Hungary.Francis also revealed a secret peace “mission” was under way. However, he gave no details when asked whether he spoke about peace initiatives during his talks in Budapest this weekend with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban or the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Hungary.Relatives bury children killed in Russian missile attack03:00 , William Mata Relatives and friends cried next to coffins on Sunday as they buried children and others killed in a Russian missile attack on this central Ukrainian city, while fighting claimed more lives elsewhere.Almost all of the 23 victims of the attack on Friday died when two missiles slammed into an apartment building in Uman. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said six children were among the dead.Mykhayl Shulha, 6, cried and hugged relatives next to the coffin of his 11-year-old sister Sofia Shulha during Sunday’s funeral, while others paid respects to a 17-year-old boy.As mourners held candles, crossed themselves and sang, the priest at the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God “Quick to Hear” waved a vessel containing incense over the coffins. He said the deaths had hit the entire community hard.“I live nearby,” said Father Fyodor Botsu. “I personally knew the children, the littlest, from when they were very young, and I personally baptized them in this church. I’m worried with everyone since I have children and I’m a citizen of this country and have been living in this city for 15 years.”He said he prayed “that the war should end and peace should come to our homes, city and country.”British armed forces chief comments on Ukraine02:00 , William Mata Chief of the Defence Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin has said he has accompanied the National Security Adviser Tim Barrow and had a meeting with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky.“We’ve got the capacity to deal with lots of different things at different times.

Among them were President Katalin Novak and Hungary’s right-wing populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, whose lukewarm support for Ukraine has rankled fellow European Union members.Pope on the banks of the Danube in final Mass in Hungary Four civilians killed in Ukrainian shelling on Russia’s BryanskSunday 30 April 2023 14:49 , Maryam Zakir-Hussain Four civilians died as a result of Ukrainian shelling on a village just over the border in Russia‘s Bryansk region on Saturday evening, a local governor said.“Four civilians have been killed,” Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on the Telegram messaging app. Two other citizens were being treated in hospital, Bogomaz said.Bogomaz earlier said that one residential building had been completely destroyed and two other houses partially destroyed.Bogomaz blamed the incident on “Ukrainian nationalists”. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia and on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.Both sides deny targeting civilians in the 14-month-old Russian invasion on Ukraine.“Work is continuing at the site of the incident to remove rubble and clear the area,” Bogomaz said. “A state of emergency has been introduced in the village.”Russia‘s Bryansk region borders Ukraine.

More than 50,000 people gathered in and around the square behind Budapest’s iconic neo-gothic parliament building, a symbol of the capital on the Danube, to see the pope on the last day of his visit to the country.  He continued a theme he began on the first day of his visit on Friday, when he warned against the dangers of rising nationalism in Europe, but put it in gospel context, saying that closed doors were painful and contrary to the teachings of Jesus.  Orban, a populist who was attending the Mass, sees himself as a protector of Christian values. He has said he would not allow Hungary to be transformed into an “immigrant country,” as he claims others in Europe have become, unrecognizable to its native peoples.  In his homily, 86-year-old Francis said that if Hungarians wanted to follow Jesus, they had to shun “the closed doors of our individualism amid a society of growing isolation; the closed doors of our indifference towards the underprivileged and those who suffer; the doors we close towards those who are foreign or unlike us, towards migrants or the poor”.  Francis believes migrants fleeing poverty should be welcomed and integrated because they can culturally enrich host countries and boost Europe’s dwindling populations. He believes that while countries have a right to protect their borders, migrants should be distributed throughout the European Union.  Orban’s government has built a steel fence on the border with Serbia to keep out migrants.  In his homily, Francis also spoke against doors “closed to the world”.  ‘Thick’ Russian forces suffer radiation sickness after digging trenches and fishing in Chernobyl  Russian troops who dug trenches in Chernobyl forest during their occupation of the area have been struck down with radiation sickness, authorities have confirmed. Ukrainians living near the nuclear power station that exploded 37 years ago, and choked the surrounding area in radioactive contaminants, warned the Russians when they arrived against setting up camp in the forest. But the occupiers who, as one resident put it to The Times, “understood the risks” but were “just thick”, installed themselves in the forest, reportedly carved out trenches, fished in the reactor’s cooling channel – flush with catfish – and shot animals, leaving them dead on the roads. ‘Thick’ Russian troops suffer sickness after digging and fishing in Chernobyl  What are the ‘dragon’s teeth’ defences being erected by Russia in Ukraine?  Russian forces have been erecting “dragon’s teeth” defensive barricades in areas of Ukraine they control, in anticipation of an imminent counteroffensive by Kyiv, according to the latest satellite imagery of the warzone. The defensive obstacles, pyramid-shaped concrete shards also nicknamed “devil’s teeth” for their resemblance to a fanged jawline, can be seen running between anti-tank ditches and troop-manned trenches from western Russia through eastern Ukraine towards Crimea , in aerial imagery recorded by Capella Space, Reuters reports.  The layered, zig-zagging lines are intended to make life as difficult as possible for any oncoming Ukrainian forces, as Russia seeks to protect the territory it has seized. What are the ‘dragon’s teeth’ defences being erected by Russia in Ukraine?  Ukraine welcomes EU deal on continued farm exports  Ukraine on Saturday welcomed the European Union’s hard-fought deal to keep farm exports flowing into and through the bloc to world markets, saying that the Middle East and Africa would specifically stand to benefit from it. Late Friday, the 27-nation EU ended a damaging internal standoff over a destabilizing glut of Ukraine farm imports by granting five eastern member countries the right to temporarily ban the most problematic produce while allowing all farm products to transit onward. Resolving the issue allows the EU to maintain a unified stance in the face of Russia’s invasion of its neighbor. “We welcome that we resolved this issue,” Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko said at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Stockholm. Ukraine welcomes EU deal on continued farm exports  Pope visits refugees, urges Hungary to show charity to all  Pope Francis thanked Hungarians on Saturday for welcoming Ukrainian refugees and urged them to help anyone in need, as he begged for a culture of charity in a country where the prime minister has justified firm anti-immigration policies with fears that migration threatens Europe’s Christian culture. On the second day of a visit to Hungary, Francis met with refugees and poor people at St. Elizabeth’s church, which was named for a Hungarian princess who renounced her wealth to dedicate herself to the poor as a follower of the pope’s namesake, St. Francis of Assisi. Speaking in the white-brick church in Budapest , Francis recalled that the Gospel instructs Christians to show love and compassion to all, especially those experiencing poverty and pain and “even those who are not believers.” Pope visits refugees, urges Hungary to show charity to all  Wagner threatens Bakhmut withdrawal  Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of Russia’s Wagner Group has threatened to withdraw troops from Bakhmut, saying they had enough ammunition left only for days. In a nearly 90-minute video interview with Russian military blogger Semyon Pegov published on Saturday, Mr Prigozhin said: “If the shortage of ammunition is not replenished, then ... most likely, we will be forced to withdraw part of the units.” He was quoting a letter he said was sent to Russia’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, giving an 28 April deadline. It was not immediately known when the interview was recorded. Mr Prigozhin has often blamed regular armed forces for not giving his men the ammunition they need and has sometimes accused top brass of betrayal. “We need to stop deceiving the population and telling them that everything is fine,” he was quoted as saying in the interview. “I must honestly say: Russia is on the brink of a disaster.”  ICYMI: Pope Francis meets refugees who fled Ukraine on Hungary visit  Pope Francis has met with refugees who fled from Ukraine during the invasion as part of his three-day trip to Hungary.

3466,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,13/8/2022,860 words,Daniel Sanderson,SNP plan to house Ukrainian refugees on cruise ships costs £100m; Housing Ukrainian refugees on cruise ships costs up to £100m,"THE SNP's controversial plan to send Ukrainian refugees to live on cruise ships is set to cost taxpayers up to £100million, it has emerged. Details of the astronomical cost, which were revealed yesterday, came shortly after it was confirmed that a second ship has been secured, which will be docked on the Clyde, in a bid to ease a severe accommodation crisis. Nicola Sturgeon pushed the UK Government to allow Scotland to take in an ""uncapped"" number of victims of Russia's invasion and suggested UK ministers lacked humanity by failing to do enough to help refugees. However, her ""super sponsor"" scheme has descended into chaos, as there is not enough safe housing for refugees to be sent to. So far, around 10,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Scotland through the super sponsor route. Visas were approved for a further 20,000 before the scheme was axed last month, meaning they still have the right to come to the country. Neil Gray, the SNP minister with responsibility for refugees, admitted yesterday that the Government is ""getting very close"" to running out of temporary accommodation, particularly in the Central Belt. Despite repeatedly pledging to offer a ""warm Scottish welcome"" to Ukrainians, it also emerged yesterday that those with permission to come to Scotland are being urged to find their own housing or told they risk being placed in ""emergency accommodation"". Ukrainians are already living in a cruise ship docked in Leith, the MS Victoria, which has windowless rooms which at capacity would be more cramped than prison cells. The Scottish Government has insisted the ship is popular with those living on it. A second vessel, the MS Ambition, will be docked on the Clyde, and will provide accommodation for up to 1,750 people from next month in 714 cabins. They are being provided through a contract with the firm Corporate Travel Management. Under the terms of the deal, which also includes sourcing hotel accommodation, the maximum value is set at £100million. ""While we must do all we can to support the Ukrainian refugees bravely fleeing their war-torn homeland, these costs are eye-watering,"" Miles Briggs, the Scottish Tory MSP, said. ""They are typical of the SNP's record of allowing Continued on Page 2 Continued from Page 1 costs to grow after initially boasting about projects they are in charge of. ""At the heart of their failures are Ukrainian refugees who have been left in limbo or have been housed in these cramped cruise ships,"" he said. ""The SNP look to have spent a lot on a contract, without delivering what they promised to those seeking to settle in Scotland."" The Scottish Government had previously refused to say how much it was spending on its cruise ship plan, only saying that the sum was comparable to renting out hotel rooms. Mr Gray said yesterday, in an update to MSPs, that the ship in Edinburgh is already providing accommodation to 1,000 Ukrainians, with several hundred believed to be arriving in Scotland every week. He added: ""We are getting very close to capacity for the temporary accom modation currently available, particularly across the Central Belt. ""We do not want people having to stay in temporary accommodation for any longer than is necessary. We are therefore putting every effort into helping people find longer-term accommodation in communities across Scotland."" Scottish Government officials have also discussed issuing a formal plea to the British Army for help bailing them out of the crisis. Refugees rights activists have warned that sending vulnerable people to live on cruise ships should be seen as only an emergency short-term solution, saying that using them as long-term accommodation could harm their chances of integrating into society. However, the MS Ambition and the MS Victoria have been hired for six months, suggesting they will still be needed next year. It has emerged that a major celebration of Ukraine could be staged in Glasgow, after the city made the shortlist to host the next Eurovision song contest. The event, which is taking place in the UK because Ukraine, which won this year's contest, cannot host it, would be staged at the SECC or OVO Hydro venues on the banks of the Clyde, where the MS Ambition will also be docked. Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, said that while a ""Eurovision party"" was taking place, victims of the conflict could be living nearby on ""cramped conditions on a cruise ship"" due to the SNP's mishandling of its scheme. ""These families have endured unimaginable hardship and are being let down by the Scottish Government,"" he said. ""The Scottish Government's resettlement scheme is in utter chaos - refugees from Ukraine deserve so much more than this shambles. Nicola Sturgeon must urgently fix this mess."" A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: ""The Scottish Government has chartered the MS Ambition for six months through CTM, its travel-related services provider, under the same contract used to procure MS Victoria I.

3467,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,26/8/2022,556 words,Simon Johnson,Ukrainian refugees left in temporary accommodation in Scotland,"MORE than 1,500 Ukrainian refugees are languishing in temporary accommodation across Scotland after applying for homes under Nicola Sturgeon's ""super sponsor"" scheme. Figures obtained by the Scottish Tories under the Freedom of Information Act disclosed that one in five of those who fled the war in their homeland and arrived in Scotland were still awaiting a match under the scheme. The local authority statistics showed that 1,518 people and one family were still waiting in temporary accommodation as of June 2022. However, the Tories said this total is likely to be a huge underestimate as Edinburgh City Council failed to provide any figures. Between 1,600 and 1,700 refugees in Edinburgh are being housed on a cruise ship. Ms Sturgeon's plan allowed refugees to name the Scottish Government as a sponsor under the UK's Homes for Ukraine scheme, rather than having to be matched with individuals. At the time Ms Sturgeon attacked UK Government ""bureaucracy and red tape"" and suggested Tory ministers lacked humanity in their approach. But the Scottish Government announced last month there would be a three-month ""pause"" to the scheme because of a lack of available homes. Those whose applications were already in the system were to be dis patched to two tower blocks in Lanarkshire that had been earmarked for demolition and an Estonian cruise ship, docked in Leith. A second ship has been hired, which will be docked on the Clyde at a total cost to the taxpayer of £100million. Miles Briggs, the Scottish Tories' shadow housing secretary, said: ""This scheme was supposed to offer refugees a sense of stability but today thousands are still facing an uncertain future without a sponsor. Yet this can only happen if sponsorship is being prop erly promoted, something which the SNP Government is failing to do. ""We cannot be allowed to simply forget about these refugees and more must be done to settle them properly."" The figures disclosed that only 30 Ukrainian refugees had been matched with sponsors in Aberdeen, with 200 living in temporary accommodation. In Glasgow the figures were 78 and 384 respectively and the Highlands 70 and 245. Among the other local authorities to report high numbers of refugees being forced into temporary housing were Renfrewshire (232) and South Lanarkshire (193). Ms Sturgeon has come under increased pressure to ""lead by example"" and take a refugee into her large Glasgow home she shares with her husband, Peter Murrell, the SNP's chief executive. In March this year the First Minister said she would be willing to take in a refugee ""if needed"", suggesting her decision would depend on whether there were enough alternative homes for them. However, last month she said a refugee may not want the publicity that living with her would attract and argued her role was to ensure Scotland gave refuge to thousands of Ukrainians rather than ""one person"". Neil Gray, the SNP's minister with special responsibilities for refugees, said: ""We are pleased that thanks in large part to our Super Sponsor Scheme, we are now providing safe accommodation to more displaced people from Ukraine per head of population than any other part of the UK. ""Since the conflict began, almost 15,000 people with a Scottish sponsor have arrived, representing 17.6 per cent of all UK arrivals, the most per head of any of the four nations.""",Broadsheet,1

Any migrants who arrive illegally across the Channel, including Ukrainians or Afghan interpreters, could be sent to Rwanda to claim asylum, MPs on the Commons home affairs committee were told. This came as Tom Pursglove, a Home Office minister, could not point to any calculations to show the Rwanda relocation policy would reduce the number of Channel migrants reaching the UK in small boats. A record 7,848 have so far crossed this year, treble last year's rate. Ireland has decided to lift all restrictions for refugees fleeing war, prompting claims it could create a backdoor to the UK, leaving the country vulnerable to potential criminal elements. The common travel area means Ukrainians who do not pass British security checks or are waiting for visas to arrive could reach the UK by entering Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic and taking a ferry to the UK. Stuart McDonald, the SNP home affairs spokesman and a committee member, asked Dan Hobbs, the Home Office director of asylum, protection and enforcement, about Ukrainians entering Northern Ireland from Ire land. Mr McDonald asked: ""Are they within the scope of this policy or are they not?"" Mr Hobbs replied that ""depending on the individual circumstances they may not fall in the 'inadmissibility' criteria"". Mr McDonald said: ""You are leaving open the possibility that you can cross from Dublin to Belfast and conceivably end up in Rwanda."" Earlier, Mr Hobbs had said the only nationality excluded from the Rwanda policy were Rwandans. Asked if the policy would include Afghan interpreters or Ukrainians crossing the Channel illegally, Mr Pursglove did not rule it out. ""Those who have arrived through dangerous and unnecessary journeys are in scope to be relocated to Rwanda, but... We will work on a case by case basis,"" he said. Mr Pursglove admitted the Rwanda policy would take time before it started to reduce crossings as many would already have paid the people smugglers. Asked what modelling was used to give the ""evidence base"" for it deterring migrants, he said that ""we will see this policy, as part of a wider package that we are introducing, really shift the dynamic"". 7,848 Number of Channel migrants who have reached the UK in small boats this year so far - treble last year's rate",Broadsheet,1
3485,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,4/6/2022,814 words,NA,Payments to families hosting Ukrainians are 'insufficient',"Payments made to British families who welcome Ukrainian refugees are ""nowhere near enough"" amid soaring energy bills and inflation, charities and hosts have said. Volunteers who host Ukrainians who have fled the Russian invasion receive £350 a month per family as a ""thank you"", as long as they don't charge rent. But hosts have argued that this money from the Government does not go far enough as energy and food bills continue to rise. Some are also spending thousands of pounds preparing their homes to accommo date large families. Jonathan Clive Blake, 65, is the archbishop of the Open Episcopal Church. In March he and his wife, Annette, 63, volunteered to host Ukrainian refugees. This week, after a month-long ""bureaucratic nightmare"" of forms and visa processing, a family of five arrived at their south London home. Mr Blake estimated that he had spent at least £2,450 settling the family. He bought new beds and turned the top floor of the house into a bedroom for the mother, father and fouryear-old daughter. Hosts must apply for the £350 payment at the end of every month. Mr Blake said: ""It's disingenuous to suggest this is a 'thank you' payment when it's obviously long-term support to cover costs,"" he said. He added that the Government should invest in a ""set-up grant"" for households who want to host Ukrainian refugees. His family's energy bills have more than doubled since the refugees moved in, having already rocketed following the increase in the energy price cap in April. Mr Blake said: ""Our energy bill went from £20 a week to £45 a week. With the family living here it's gone up to £90 a week. It's a bit frightening."" While the refugee family grapples with the process of securing jobs, school places and doctors' appointments, Mr and Mrs Blake continue to provide financial support. Neither of the Ukrainian parents was able to continue working remotely for Kyiv-based companies although Mr Blake said the father had secured freelance work as a video editor in London. ""At the moment they are disorientated,"" he said. ""So we've provided everything and guided them towards the things they need to do to get set up. We've got two fridges, so we've given them one. They've started taking responsibility for the child's meals but we still share an evening meal."" Mr Blake said the Ukrainians he hosted were aware of the rising energy costs and were likely to contribute ""in time, based on how much they use"". Ukrainian refugees are permit ted to work in Britain and also receive £200 on arrival. Between their full-time work and their portfolio of buy-to-lets, Mr and Mrs Blake have a ""secure"" income, although they set rents below the market average and refuse to raise them as they do not want to ""cripple"" tenants. But Mr Blake said families who were less stable would be shocked by the immediate cost of welcoming displaced refugees. ""We're more secure than many families but it's not as simple as it seems,"" he said. ""On paper we've got quite a lot of assets in our name but there's a mortgage to be paid. The cash you have is constrained. A less secure family is going to realise too late that there are all these things you have to buy that they weren't ready for."" Stan Benes of Opora, a platform that offers emergency assistance to Ukrainians in Britain, said the ""thank you"" payment had been misnamed and the Government had issued ""no clear guidance"" to hosts about the intended purpose of the money. ""Many people were not prepared for what would be involved both practically and personally,"" he said. ""The £350 is a nice amount out of context, but if you consider the fact it should be used to offset extra costs it's nowhere near enough. ""There are many ways this could have been approached - and none of it is bad in itself - but it's just not been thought through."" Helena Tubridy, 62, a fertility expert, is currently hosting a Ukrainian couple and their five-year-old at her home in County Meath, Ireland. She has also had to economise even though the Ukrainian couple, aged 31 and 32, are continuing to work remotely as hydroelectric engineers for Kyiv-based employers. The Irish government offers (EURO)400 (£340) a month per property to hosts, while Ukrainian refugees receive a monthly payment. Ms Tubridy said: ""We are treating it as a house share - we keep our food separate. We've always had to be careful. It's all very manageable, but we're definitely feeling the pinch."" After two-and-a-half months the Ukrainian couple began to contribute a third of the household's energy bills. A spokesman for the British Government said: ""We know there may be some small additional costs associated with helping out, which is why we offer an optional 'thank you' payment of £350 a month for all those open ing their homes.""

Andriy Demchenko, a spokesman for the State Border Guard Service, said more than 870,000 Ukrainians had returned, with 25,000 to 30,000 now returning each day. The disclosure came as the UK Government revealed it was processing more than 3,500 family or Homes for Ukraine visas a day - and was on target to turn round applications within 48 hours. It follows weeks of delays and criticism of the bureaucratic response to the refugee crisis by the Home Office. More than 25,000 visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have now been approved, nearly doubling the number in a week. There have also been 31,400 family visas approved for Ukrainians, giving a total of 56,500 so far granted. Only about 16,400 Ukrainians have arrived - a figure ministers attributed to some deciding to stay in the region, return to their homeland or who are using it as a fallback. It came as former Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick revealed he had become the first MP to take in a Ukrainian family under a special scheme set up by the Home Office. However, Tory MP Mr Jenrick told today's Chopper's Politics podcast that Home Office red tape in the Ukrainian Family Scheme had ""tested the patience of sponsors and, more importantly, of the families and individuals them selves"". There has been a steady return of Ukrainian men to the country as they went back to fight the Russian invasion. Mr Demchenko said: ""They say they see that the situation is safer, especially in the western regions, and they can no longer stay abroad. They are ready to return to the country and stay here."" It followed the retreat by Russian forces from near Kyiv, as Vladimir Putin prepared to ramp up their offensive in the east of the country. According to the UN refugee agency UNHCR, more than 4.7million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Mr Putin launched the invasion on Feb 24, triggering Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since the Second World War. Two weeks ago, The Daily Telegraph disclosed how environment minister Victoria Prentis had taken in Vika, a 25-year-old Ukrainian refugee, under an existing visitor visa scheme. Mr Jenrick, who was housing secretary until last September, called on officials to stop forcing children to fill out separate forms to come to the UK and allow them to be completed in Ukrainian to speed up the process. The Jenrick family welcomed Maria, 40, and her two children Christina, 11, and Boden, 15, at Stansted airport earlier this week. The two families are now living together in his Newark constituency. Mr Jenrick insisted that he had not pulled any strings to speed the process up. He said it was right that British families had to match their own families in Ukraine as ""there are limits to the role of the state and as a country we have so much to offer when individuals and civil society come together"". But he added: ""I do think the process has been overly bureaucratic and I think the Home Office often falls into this trap. ""There were simple things that we could and should have done from the outset, like having the form in Ukrainian, for example.""

It follows the launch last week of the Government's Homes for Ukraine scheme, which asked the public to open up their homes to people fleeing the Russian invasion who have no family in the UK. Some 150,000 individuals and organisations have so far registered to participate in it. The application process was officially launched on Friday and the first refugees are expected to arrive within days. Nearly 10,000 people with family links have been granted visas to come to the UK. There are at least five ministerial grace-and-favour homes, including Chequers, the Buckinghamshire retreat given to the nation in 1917 for the use of the serving Prime Minister, and Chevening, the 115-room Kent man sion that is the Foreign Secretary's official residence. Asked about using grace-and-favour homes to house refugees, a government source said: ""It is something that the Prime Minister has asked officials to look into. It is a possibility, but it is not straightforward. They are owned by trusts and there are obviously issues with security."" Mr Johnson, when asked about the possibility, said: ""I am happy for those that are responsible to look into it."" It follows public declarations of an intention to take in refugees by two cabinet ministers - Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Communities Secretary, who is the minister overseeing the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Yesterday, Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, ruled out participating, but said he and his wife would help ""in other ways"". There is potentially space at the five grace-and-favour homes, which have a total of 37 double bedrooms, for around 100 refugees. Besides Chequers and Chevening, there is also Dorneywood, the 18th-century Buckinghamshire mansion that has traditionally been used by chancellors, and Carlton Gardens and Admiralty Arch, which each have four apartments. The move came as John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones4U, a mobile phone company, and his partner, Modesta Vzesniauskaite, a former Olympic cyclist, announced that they would open up their home for two Ukrainian refugees. He said he would offer a two bed room house in the grounds of his home in Eccleshall, Staffordshire, to two people who have fled the conflict in Ukraine. The offer comes with free food and utilities for ""as long as they need it"". Calling the Government's slow response to the refugee crisis ""embarrassing"", Mr Caudwell said he considered his offer a ""small gesture and my humanitarian duty"".

As well as Mr Trump, who the former prime minister reportedly had dinner with on Thursday, Mr Johnson also met other Republicans including Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state. The two former leaders discussed ""the situation in Ukraine and the vital importance of Ukrainian victory"", a spokesman for Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson has been a staunch ally of Ukraine and its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, repeatedly urging Western countries to do more to support Kyiv. At a CNN town hall earlier this month, Mr Trump refused to say whether Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, or who he wanted to win in the conflict, saying only that he wants ""everybody to stop dying"". As president, Mr Trump had a close relationship with the man he once called ""Britain Trump,"" reportedly going so far as to give Mr Johnson his personal mobile phone number.

Ministers are to launch a hotline and webpage where individuals, charities, businesses and community groups will be able to offer rooms to refugees who have no family links to the UK. The move follows criticism of the Home Office's ""chaotic"" rollout of its scheme for refugees who have family in the UK that has led to delays and complaints of excessive bureaucracy. Western officials yesterday warned that the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine could rise as high as four million in the coming days, almost doubling the current estimates of 2.2 million. It came as Boris Johnson last night warned that Britons may face a ""bumpy period"" of economic pain as a result of banning oil and gas imports from Russia. The Prime Minister said the UK would take ""dramatic steps"" to achieve an ""independent energy supply, so that we're no longer capable of being blackmailed by Putin"". The strategy is set to include the major expansion of North Sea oil extraction, renewables and nuclear. He is also expected to speak directly to the big oil producing nations next week about ramping up production. Household energy support loans could also be doubled to £400 this autumn under plans to help families facing even higher fuel bills because of Russia's invasion. Mr Johnson has asked Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, to draw up a list of options to support families through next winter, amid expectations the energy price cap will rise again in October. Michael Gove, the Communities Secretary, will unveil the new ""sponsored"" humanitarian refugee route on Monday. It will grant Ukrainians without family links leave to stay in the UK for an initial 12 months and entitle them to work, claim benefits and access public services. Civil servants will match them with the offers of free housing from the sponsoring individuals, charities and businesses, who will be vetted to ensure they are providing safe and secure accommodation. People offering homes will have to agree to take refugees for a minimum period of potentially six months, demonstrate the accommodation meets appropriate standards and, if necessary, undergo criminal record checks, as many of the Ukrainians are likely to be women and children. Ministers are expected to set targets for the number of offers and will look to other accommodation providers, including councils and housing associations. ""It's going to be tens of thousands initially,"" said a source. The Home Office will recruit the Ukrainian refugees, who will require visas and undergo the same biometric and security checks as those entering through the family scheme. Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, yesterday announced that all Ukrainians with passports will be able to apply online to come to the UK, after the security services cleared a new streamlined system to cut delays in the visa application process. Ukrainians with passports will no longer need to go to a visa application centre (VAC) for biometric checks before they come to the UK and instead only have to upload their passport and then take checks after arrival. However, Micheál Martin, the Irish taoiseach, yesterday said the Home Secretary had expressed concern to the Irish government that the country's approach to Ukrainian refugees would lead to them arriving in Britain through the back door. Ireland joined the EU-wide scheme that allows people fleeing Ukraine to settle without a visa for three years. Speaking on Sky News last night, Mr Johnson said it ""will allow people to come in, so people welcome [refugees] into their own homes"". A source said: ""It's a humanitarian call for action. The majority will be doing it out of philanthropic motives."" Refugees at Home, a charity that connects people with spare rooms to refugees, said it had already seen a 50-fold increase since the Russian invasion, rising from an average of 20 applications a fortnight to 1,000 since Feb 24 offering to host Ukrainians fleeing the war. One healthcare provider in Sussex has offered around 150 rooms in three vacant care homes it manages. Tony Stein, the chief executive of Healthcare Management Solutions, said refugees could be offered jobs in the care sector where one in five posts are vacant. ""I would like this to be a catalyst for the rest of the sector to look at what they have got and what they can do. There is a lot of empty property, empty care homes,"" he said. Mr Johnson lambasted the Russian president over his ""cynical, barbaric government"", as he made a ""prediction"" that the Kremlin was about to resort to using chemical weapons in Ukraine. The move ""is straight out of their playbook"", the Prime Minister said. He also raised fears that the Russian president has ""driven his tank … down a cul de sac"" and will find it ""very hard to extricate himself "" from the war. Mr Johnson said recent phone calls in which Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has repeatedly pleaded for the West to impose a no-fly zone over his country had been ""deeply upsetting"" and ""agonising"". Nato has said the idea is off the table. Asked whether the nation would have to accept economic pain while trying to defeat Vladimir Putin, he said ""yes"", adding it was ""absolutely right"". The Prime Minister insisted that the Government ""will do everything we can to help households, help people with the cost of fuel, particularly elderly vulnerable people"". He said: ""Now is the time to unleash an extraordinary programme of energy independence through massive investment in renewables … a lot more nuclear, and also in sensible use of our own hydrocarbons, with our own oil and gas and without busting our carbon budget."" The West must ""learn the lesson of indulging and appeasing Putin and failing to wean ourselves off Russian oil Continued on Page 5 Continued from Page 1 and gas"" Mr Johnson warned. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has already announced that the energy cap will increase next month by 54 per cent, prompting Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, to launch a £200 loan scheme to help households with their energy bills. But ministers are concerned that another increase in the cost of oil and gas, caused by the war, will mean the price cap will increase again in October. Experts have speculated that the average household energy bill could reach £4,000 by the end of this year. One plan under consideration is an extension of the loan, with households handed £400 or more in rebates. This week, the RAC said the average cost of a tank of fuel is now almost £88. Diesel is already exceeding £1.80 per litre in some parts of the country, and in London motorists are paying more than £2 per litre for petrol. Food is also expected to become more expensive since the Russian invasion, with wheat prices reaching record levels. Ukraine is a major European producer of wheat and grain.

The frustration is palpable. One correspondent revealed how he had applied to host a family in a large house only to be told he did not qualify because he did not live near a city. Another reader questioned the requirement for local authorities to check whether the proffered accommodation was safe given that the refugees were escaping a war zone. Yet another described how efforts to settle refugees were being thwarted, describing the Homes for Ukraine scheme as an ""utter embarrassment"" for the country. The Home Office is operating two visa schemes: the Ukraine Family scheme, which permits refugees with relatives in the UK to enter the country, and the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows households to offer to host refugees not previously known to them. Families who may have fled with almost nothing are expected to fill in a lengthy visa form, supply biometrics, passports, and the rest. Even when those hurdles are overcome, those trying to welcome them have to be vetted and their homes inspected. To add insult to injury, insiders say the delays are in part caused by staff shortages, with many civil servants still working away from the office. We keep being told that matters are being handled efficiently and yet the experience of those trying to help suggests this is simply not true. Starting such schemes from scratch is obviously not easy, but we are more than a month into this crisis now and the Home Office has still to rise to the challenge.

""We will do what is right,"" said Priti Patel as she detailed her new scheme to help Ukrainian refugees. ""That's not enough!"" heckled the opposition, who have been hearing from constituents desperate to bring relatives to the UK. Visas have been costly, confusing, bureaucratic; many MPs are coming round to the view that it's wrong to demand to see one's papers at all. The explanation is ""security"", said Ms Patel, on the grounds that Russian spies could be hiding among the coachloads of women and children - but in that case, asked Ben Bradshaw, why not submit people to background checks while waiving the visas? It's Covid all over again: ribbons/ masks on the opposition benches versus Tories, in the words of the SNP's Stuart McDonald, who have to be ""dragged towards a generous... response"".

Prince William landed in the southeastern city of Rzeszow, about 60 miles from the Ukrainian border, yesterday afternoon amid tight security to show his support for the troops responding to the humanitarian fallout from the war. He said he was ""struck by their passion as well as their shared determination to defend our shared freedoms"" in the face of the conflict, telling them: ""Everyone back home thoroughly supports you."" The Prince added that the joint cooperation of Britain and Poland ""in support of the people of Ukraine and their freedom"" had strengthened the ties between the two countries. The Prince told the British soldiers at an air defence military base: ""I just wanted to come here in person to say thank you for all that you're doing, keeping everyone safe out here and keeping an eye on what's going on. You're doing a really important job."" The Prince spent about 20 minutes chatting to service personnel inside a military tent before being shown a vast array of equipment, including a Polish self-propelled howitzer artillery system that had a British turret. The soldiers described how they spent 26 weeks training to use the hitech surface-to-air Sky Sabre missile defence system, which Britain first delivered to Poland last May before extending the deployment in October. Lance Corporal Molly Pettifer, 28, who is two weeks into a six-month tour of Poland, told the Prince about her work training troops in first aid and later revealed that her grandmother's friend had delivered the Prince at birth.

The Prince, who was greeted by Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland's defence minister and deputy prime minister, was also given a confidential briefing on the situation on the Polish-Ukrainian border. Speaking afterwards, William said he also wanted to pay tribute to the ""inspiring humanity of the Polish people"", adding: ""You have opened your hearts as much as your homes."" More than 10million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border into Poland since the beginning of the war last February. The visit marks the Prince's first trip to the country since 2017. He said it was ""fantastic"" to be back, adding that ""our nations have strong ties"". In the evening the Prince visited an accommodation centre in Warsaw to meet Ukrainians who have fled the war. The converted office building currently houses 300 Ukrainian women and children and it opened its doors as soon as the conflict began. William toured the building, having selfies taken with children and trying his hand at table tennis with some teenagers. The Daily Telegraph understands that the Prince very much wanted to see the humanitarian side of the conflict for himself while in Poland and felt it was important to show his support. He took the time to sit and talk with families, through a translator, who have been living in Poland for the last year after fleeing the war and he was also shown around some of the bedrooms. The visit will be considered an important show of public support for Ukraine. 'It was quite special.

Rishi Sunak is expected to declare as early as next week the ""beginning of the end"" of asylum hotels, which are being used to house more than 50,000 migrants at a cost of nearly £7million a day. It is expected to be announced that migrants will initially be moved into ""decent but rudimentary"" accommodation in former military bases that will be used to house single, adult male migrants. Ministers are also understood to be seeking to use disused ferries but plans to use student accommodation and holiday camps have been put on hold. Ministers are expected to argue that the living conditions meet the Government's minimum legal obligations, but will toughen its approach to coun ter the ""pull factor"" of asylum hotels and reduce the cost. They have included four-star country houses on rural estates. It follows violent protests outside the hotels where pro- and anti-immigration groups have clashed, and growing anger among Tory backbenchers at the impact on over-stretched local services and economies. Ministers face a backlash from councils in two of the areas with military bases where the migrants are expected to be transferred. Officials from both Continued on Page 2 Continued from Page 1 authorities told The Telegraph that they were considering legal action over the moves. Mr Sunak faces potentially the biggest rebellion of his premiership as up to 60 Tory MPs attempt to toughen the new illegal migration Bill by giving UK courts the power to ignore rulings by Strasbourg judges, disapplying parts of the Human Rights Act and blocking injunctions to prevent deportations. The rebel MPs, including at least six former ministers, are backing amendments at next week's committee stage to ensure plans to detain and swiftly remove migrants can go ahead, irre spective of any judgments from the European Court of Human Rights. The MPs have been called into No 10 to try to resolve the row. The military bases and ferries will be used to clear asylum seekers from the hotels and to house Channel migrants who reach the UK on small boats. Ministers have said the small boats legislation will apply retrospectively to migrants who arrive after the Bill was laid on March 7 but before it is passed this Summer. This enables them to be removed under its terms to a third country, such as Rwanda, once it is passed. Some 3,680 migrants have crossed the Channel so far this year after a record 45,755 reached the UK in 2022. It is understood ministers are also planning to use ferries, emulating an approach by the Scottish Government which housed Ukrainian refugees in two 700-cabin ships. They were docked in Glasgow and Edinburgh and could hold 1,750 people each. It is not known where the UK Government's ferries might be berthed. Two military bases have been identified - RAF Scampton, the Dambusters' base in Lincolnshire, and MDP Wethersfield in Braintree, Essex - which could each house up to 1,500 migrants in refurbished barracks and portacabins. Ministers will make a final decision before a possible announcement in the middle of next week. Council leaders have been told up to 5,000 migrants could move through each over the space of a year. The migrants transferred from hotels would not be detained but would be free to come and go, with medical and other facilities provided on site. James Cleverly, the Foreign Secre tary, who is local MP for the Essex base, is among those who have objected. He wrote on his Facebook page that Wethersfield was inappropriate as an asylum camp due to ""the remote nature of the site, limited transport infrastructure and narrow road network.""",Broadsheet,0

Only 1,200 out of 43,600 applicants have so far arrived in Britain in the three weeks since the Homes for Ukraine scheme was officially opened three weeks ago. About 12,500 visa applications have been granted but all Ukrainians, of any age, have had to apply separately for temporary residence in the UK. It means a mother's visa may be approved by the Home Office but not the child's or vice versa, which prevents them leaving for the UK as they cannot travel alone. Viktoriia, a qualified nurse, has been granted a visa but she cannot leave her son, Mykhailo, 17, to take up an offer of accommodation in Reigate, Surrey, because his application has not yet been approved. James King, a Tory councillor, whose father Paul will host the pair, said it was ""just outrageous"" that the family had effectively been separated with the son's application still outstanding three weeks after they applied on March 19. He said Viktoriia and Mykhailo, who fled the bombing in Kharkiv, had already been forced out of accommodation in Dusseldorf and were now in Berlin. ""It is ludicrous and inexplicable. Viktoriia has got a visa but her boy has not. Why on earth is that the case?"" said Mr King. Facebook support groups reported dozens of host families and refugees in the same situation. ""Applied for four visas on the 18th and only had one approved so far,"" said David Stack. ""I applied for two adults on March 18. One has received an email. The other hasn't received anything,"" said Maria Shaw. Melanie Berthier, who coordinates a refugee Facebook group and is hosting a mother and daughter, said: ""Some of them received their visa seven or eight days ago but are still waiting for the other members of the family without getting any communication from the Home Office."" Because of the delays, Lauren Corbishley, an NHS mental health nurse, spent more than £1,000 putting up her family - Yuliia Meshchierriakova, an accountant, her partner, Glib, an IT expert, and daughter, Maryna, 17, - in hotels in Poland rather than see them living on the streets. She was told yesterday that the parents' visa applications have been assessed but the daughter's passport information has gone astray. ""How come only 1,200 people have crossed the border to reach the UK? The reason is delays like ours and because people are still waiting for their permission to travel documents even though their applications have been approved,"" she said. Maryse and Martin Haywood, from Knaresborough, N Yorks, have offered refuge to Anna, her mother Tetiana, her baby, Stephania, and her three-year-old daughter Melania in their five bedroom home. They have all had their applications granted apart from three-week-old Stephania. This requires a birth certifi- cate from a sworn associate and approval at a Visa Application Centre. The charity Love Bristol which has helped 170 Ukrainian refugees in Poland apply for UK visas, said just six had so far been approved. Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, yesterday apologised for the ""frustrating"" delays saying ""any new visa system takes time"". Home Office sources suggested the low arrival figures may be due to refugees holding onto the application as an ""option"" while staying in the region or because they decided to go to another country.

The move follows warnings from charities that ""light touch"" checks on host families would not be sufficient to protect refugee children living for at least six months in the same house as sponsoring UK adults. The ""enhanced"" Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks are generally restricted to workers in jobs such as teaching and social services dealing with children and vulnerable adults. They require the full details of a person's criminal record such as cautions, reprimands, warnings, spent and unspent convictions. Adults not hosting children will only have to undergo basic DBS checks. Ministers say the checks will not delay refugee families coming to the UK because they will not have to be completed until after they arrive. More than 150,000 Britons are understood to have registered to open their homes to Ukrainian refugees who have no family links to the UK. Ministers will today unveil how the refugees will apply to enter the UK under the ""Homes for Ukraine"" scheme. Only those with named refugee families with whom they have linked up - often through social media -will be able to participate in the first phase. Charities, companies, church and other community groups are expected to ramp up numbers in the second phase when ministers hope to have set up a ""matching"" system that will link up refugees with Britons without them having to do it for themselves. Ministers say they have also streamlined the visa application process to complete it within days. Lord Harrington, the Minister for Refugees, said on Wednesday that he expected thousands to arrive next week, with the first due as early as Monday. Refugee families will have to demonstrate proof of residence in Ukraine while British families will be required to demonstrate UK residence of at least six months and ID such as passports. Refugees with passports will be fasttracked through an online application process with security and biometric checks completed once they are in the UK. Those without passports may have to attend visa application centres in Poland or neighbouring countries. Councils have been urged to ditch the practice of taking away the 25 per cent council tax discount of single people who house refugees fleeing armed conflicts. Charities cited cases where householders have offered to take in Syrian or Afghan refugees only to be told they would lose their single person's council tax rebate worth hundreds of pounds a year. They said the ""unnecessary bureaucratic"" practice had penalised single people hosting refugees and should be scrapped for the Homes for Ukraine scheme, due to go live for formal applications today. A 71-year-old widower in Boris Johnson's constituency was told last month by the Tory-controlled Hillingdon council that her council tax discount would be docked for hosting a Syrian refugee while he underwent four weeks training for a job at Netflix. Last night the council said it would ""continue to honour the single person discount"" for Homes for Ukraine. ""We are pledging our support to refugees, and will welcome to our borough those fleeing this devastating and unimaginable conflict,"" said a spokesman. Camden council said this week that it would waive its right to raise council taxes on single people who took in Ukrainians and urged ministers to amend the law to ""make it easier for all local authorities to do the same"". Lewisham has adopted a similar position. Michael Gove's communities department, which is running the scheme, said it would discuss single-occupant council tax payers with councils after pledging that no one would lose discounts if they took in a Ukrainian refugee under the scheme.",Broadsheet,1

The number of non-EU workers, students and relatives granted visas has already increased by more than 50 per cent to more than 840,000 since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. Lower salary and skill thresholds for foreign workers, the widening of ""shortage"" jobs and the end of restrictions on students staying on to work after graduating have contributed to the surge, according to British Future, a think tank specialising in immigration and integration. The numbers this year will be pushed higher by Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion, estimated at about 50,000, and up to 150,000 Hong Kongers coming to the UK on British National Overseas visas. Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, said: ""Overall immigration will be greater than before Brexit because non-EU growth will be higher than the fall in EU migrants. ""This year could be higher than any other year in recent British history. It has come about through active policy decisions by the Government to make immigration easier."" In the referendum campaign and since, Boris Johnson has promised Brexit would allow Britain to ""take back control of its borders"" by ending freedom of movement with the EU. But he rejected his predecessor Theresa May's targets designed to keep net migration below 100,000 a year. While tough on ""illegal"" migration - as illustrated by plans to send Channel migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda - he has relaxed rules for foreign skilled migrants and students with sponsored jobs or university places in the UK. But he faces a backlash as an organisation that often sounds an alarm over mass immigration warned that Mr Johnson's pledge to take control of the UK's borders through a new post-Brexit points system was ""clearly a sham"". ""The figures showing rocketing arrivals are proof of that,"" said Alp Mehmet, the chairman of Migration Watch. Office for National Statistics estimates show that EU immigration to the UK fell as the end of free movement loomed, from 249,000 in 2016 to 198,000 in 2019. This was, however, more than compensated for by a rise in non-EU migrants, from 298,000 to 406,000. Since 2019, the only data available to track immigration are UK visas from the Home Office, which excludes EU citizens who may have been entitled to apply for EU settled status even while abroad and subsequently entered the UK. Just under 53,000 work, study and family visas were granted to EU citizens last year - a big decline, but one which has been dwarfed by the growth in non-EU immigration. The implementation of a points-based immigration system has opened up half of all jobs in the UK to foreign workers, by lowering salary and skill thresholds for migrants. Previously, employers also had to prove a British worker could not be recruited to fill a vacancy before looking abroad. The number of professions that qualify for skilled visas has been expanded, while the Government also removed caps on most visa routes. As a result, the number of work-related non-EU visas has risen by more than 20 per cent from 163,900 in 2016 to 210,000 last year. The new graduate visas, allowing students to live and work in the UK for up to two years after completing their degree, saw a bigger rise of 41 per cent with non-EU entrants jumping from 294,000 in 2016 to 416,250 last year. Even more marked was the jump in ""other"" non-EU visas including Hong Kongers and relatives of EU citizens living in the UK, which nearly trebled from 53,600 in 2016 to 165,325 last year, giving the total of 843,538. Madeleine Sumption, director of Oxford University's Migration Observatory, was sceptical about immigration figures being higher this year than 2016. ""But I certainly would not dispute the idea that what we are seeing in immigration policy is restrictions towards groups that the Government considers not to be desirable at the same time as significant liberalisation to groups that it does think are desirable,"" she said.",Broadsheet,0

Councils will be barred from removing council tax discounts of lone householders who take in refugees under the legal changes to be unveiled by Lord Harrington, the refugees minister. The moves are designed to ensure that no household is financially penalised if they participate in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which saw more than 200,000 individuals or organisations register, of which more than 40,000 have applied. ""The generosity of the general public has been astounding and I want to thank them sincerely for their ongoing support and for opening up their homes to those who need it the most,"" said Lord Harrington. ""These regulations will help ensure that sponsors are rightfully not financially penalised by opening their homes, and will provide clarity to local councils as they help us deliver this landmark scheme."" Empty or second homes will be entitled to a 50 per cent council tax dis count if they are used to house Ukrainians on the scheme. It comes on top of the £350 a month being paid to sponsors. Councils are receiving £10,500 to help pay for education, English language learning, safeguarding and social care. The moves follow cases exposed by The Telegraph where councils removed the discount to which single people were entitled after they took in refu gees. It came as British families participating in the Homes for Ukraine scheme said they feared their refugees would die in the Russian bombing or over crowded camps before the Home Office approves their applications, according to the first survey of hosts. Nine in 10 applicants for the scheme are still waiting for Home Office approval for their refugees, some of whom have remained in their country despite the Russian bombardment, according to the survey of 150 British host families covering 380 refugees. One Ukrainian family has had to move nine times to escape attacks by Russian forces and then find a place of safety with the 4.4 million refugees who have so far fled Ukraine, according to the survey by the UK Hosts for Ukrainian Families Support Group. One British householder told the survey organisers: ""My sponsee is too scared to travel without knowing where she is going. Our Zoom chats are punctuated with air-raid sirens and her heading off to the basement. I am scared she will be killed before she gets her visa. It has been over two weeks since we applied."" Another host said: ""Two of mine are aged 72, were in good health [but are] now very ill and I am afraid leaving them in a camp will kill them."" A third commented: ""The delays are causing unnecessary suffering. Exposes children to danger, trafficking and death."" The Homes for Ukraine scheme opened to applicants three weeks ago but Government figures show just 1,200 Ukrainians have arrived out of 12,500 granted and 43,600 who have applied since March 18. The 150 surveyed for the poll by the group's organiser Sue Clifford reported overwhelmingly negative experiences of the Government scheme. They were angry at having to find their own families, often via Facebook or other social media, being left in the dark on the progress of their applica tions and the bureaucracy they had to wade through to complete the process. More than 60 of the Ukrainian families had had to move, often multiple times, because of the length of time it was taking to receive their UK visas. They were spread across 18 countries from Ukraine and Poland to Croatia and Ireland, living in ""inadequate"" temporary accommodation. 'I am scared she will be killed before she gets her visa.

More than 160 signed up within 12 hours to a Facebook group to support the protest outside Parliament on Saturday morning after being left in the dark over the progress of their applications to host refugees. Most applied when the Homes for Ukraine scheme officially launched on March 18 after being told by ministers that ""thousands"" would be approved within days. But, nearly three weeks later, they have received only a confirmation of receipt from the UK Visa and Immigration (UKVI) office but no further indication on when their application will be granted. Protest organiser Lauren Corbishley, an NHS mental health nurse, who applied on March 18 to host a couple who fled Kharkiv with their 17-year-old daughter, said: ""I have never done anything like this before in my life but I am prepared to do it because we have got no answers. ""I've got people messaging me who are feeling depressed, hopeless and anxious. Their mental health is being hammered by these delays."" The refugees linked up with British families include a 24-year-old woman in Odesa, whose parents want to evacuate her before a full-scale assault by the Russians, and a 22-year-old female student from Kharkiv, who is living in the shadow of Russian artillery fire. Both applied on March 18. ""They have been told to wait by the UKVI hotline. But wait for what? A bullet in the back of the head, or to be raped? It is unacceptable,"" said Colin Sharp, a friend speaking on behalf of 22-year-old Irena from Kharkiv. Ms Corbishley has already spent £1,000 to put her Ukrainian family up in a hotel in Poland rather than see them destitute on the streets owing to the delays after they lost everything in the war. She confronted refugees minister Lord Harrington on Tuesday on an LBC phone-in over the delays and was promised an answer yesterday. But after a call back last night, she said: ""They cannot help me with an update on my application. I'm gutted. I've been lied to."" Lord Harrington has demanded an explanation for the delays, after saying they were unacceptable. But he appeared to be blindsided when asked about them on LBC, admitting he was not aware of ""data losses"" or ""glitches"" blamed by some families for their plight. Michael Gove, the Communities Secretary, who launched the Homes For Ukraine scheme, is said to be seething. Asked if the Home Office was not fit for purpose, a source said: ""On this, yes. It is quite clear that is the case. I have never seen Michael so animated over an issue over so many days. ""There's deep frustration over the fact that ministers have been asking some specific things for quite some time and they have not been delivered. There is a breakdown in communication between ministers and officials."" Some 32,000 have applied for the homes scheme, of which 10,000 have been approved, but only several hundred have arrived in Britain. Officials at the Communities Department are puzzled why early applicants are still waiting when those who applied a week after or even later have been granted. Peter Young, a 74-year-old retired chemical engineer, who has applied with wife Nancy to host 24-year-old Alexandra Verbitskaya from Odesa in their south coast bungalow, broke down on the telephone to The Daily Telegraph as he described their plight as a ""triumph of bureaucracy over humanity"".

The Home Secretary will use a speech at the National Conservatism Conference to argue that ""it's not xenophobic to say that mass and rapid migration is unsustainable"" as the Cabinet is split over the scale of immigration since the Brexit vote. The Tories made a manifesto pledge in 2019 to bring down overall migra tion, but the number is expected to hit close to 700,000 in official figures to be released within weeks, with analysis suggesting that it could even reach one million this year. Mrs Braverman's intervention comes after days of criticism aimed at the Prime Minister from some Tory MPs, many of them prominent supporters of Boris Johnson, after the party lost more than 1,000 councillors at the local elections and he abandoned a promise to scrap all EU laws by the end of 2023. Mr Sunak has put growing the economy and boosting the UK's productivity, which has lagged behind other major economies for years, at the centre of his pitch to voters. However, the Government is struggling to convince workers who left jobs during the pandemic to return, and senior Tories fear that immigration is seen as a quick fix for vacancies. Mrs Braverman will say today: ""I voted and campaigned for Brexit because I wanted Britain to control migration. So that we all have a say on what works for our country. Highskilled workers support economic growth. Fact. ""But we need to get overall immigration numbers down. And we mustn't forget how to do things for ourselves. ""There is no good reason why we can't train up enough HGV drivers, butchers or fruit pickers. Brexit enables us to build a high-skilled, high-wage economy that is less dependent on lowskilled foreign labour. ""That was our 2019 manifesto pledge and what we must deliver."" However, there are Cabinet splits on the approach to bringing down legal migration. Mrs Braverman has pushed for restrictions on the number of dependants that foreign students can bring to the UK, but the package is understood to have been watered down after resistance from Gillian Keegan, the Education Secretary. Some senior Cabinet ministers are also calling for an increase in the £26,000 minimumsalary needed for foreign work visas, deeming it too low - though no hard proposals have been drafted. The final decision on how to restrict foreign students bringing in dependants - which has risen in recent years - is understood to be now with Mr Sunak. In the 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives did not repeat David Cameron's promise to get net migration - the number of people moving to Britain minus those in the UK moving overseas - below 100,000. But there was a promise that ""overall numbers will come down"". The opposite has happened. Annual net migration peaked at 331,000 before the Brexit vote in 2016. It hit 504,000 in the year to June 2022, and analysis by migration experts suggest the figure could be as high as 997,000 when the official figures are published in the coming weeks. The number of people moving from the European Union slowed when Britain left the bloc, with ""free movement"" rules no longer applying. But jumps in the number of work visas and student visas issued to foreigners, plus the taking in of Ukrainian refugees and Hong Kong citizens, has fuelled the rise. More criticism of Mr Sunak's leadership is expected at the three-day National Conservatism Conference. Jacob Rees-Mogg, also speaking today, will say: ""Rishi Sunak made a specific promise to scrap thousands of EU laws. He has broken it. ""This is unfortunate, as one of his perceived virtues is his trustworthiness and the surrender to the Blob risks exposing the government to ridicule. It Continued on Page 2 Continued from Page 1 also risks making us poorer."" Mrs Braverman, who has become a leading figure in the Tory Party's Right flank after running for the leadership last year, left Liz Truss's Cabinet amid a row about the then prime minister's proposals to increase legal immigration. Mrs Braverman will also say in her speech: ""It's not xenophobic to say that mass and rapid migration is unsustainable in terms of housing supply, service and community relations. ""Nor is it bigoted to say that too many people come here illegally and claim asylum, and we have insufficient accommodation for them. ""I'm not embarrassed to say that I love www.Britain.No true Conservative is. It's not racist for anyone, ethnic minority or otherwise, to want to control our borders. ""I reject the Left's argument that it is hypocritical for someone from an ethnic minority to know these facts; to speak these truths. ""My parents came here through legal and controlled migration.

The Ukrainian soldier peered at the controller screen as the buzzing quadcopter disappeared from earshot, inspecting a Russian-occupied village a mile away in the forest, looking for hidden military positions. Before long, Ms Chornohuz - a striking figure whose khaki braided hair extensions matched her uniform - was pointing out smoke rising from Russian positions under Ukrainian shelling. ""You can see how just a drone can change war,"" she said over the distant thud of artillery. ""In a past century, we'd have to go on foot and risk our lives for this information."" Dramatic changes are under way in Ukraine's military, which has had to adapt quickly to survive, allowing for new roles and ways of doing things. That a feminist poet and mother is serving as a combat medic and drone pilot in a front-line reconnaissance unit is one example. ""On Feb 24, everything changed, everything became more democratic,"" said Ms Chornohuz, who at 27 has fought for a decade for a democratic Ukraine with a European outlook. Before she was a warrior, she was an activist. In 2013, when the Euromaidan protests broke out, she was a literature student in capital Kyiv who joined the revolution to oust Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president. A struggle for Ukraine's future was under way, with the Kremlin backing pro-Russian forces inside the country who opposed greater integration with the West. Young activists like Ms Chornohuz threw themselves into promoting the Ukrainian language as a cornerstone of a national identity free from Moscow's influence. Reading the works of Ukrainian dissidents killed during the Great Terror of the 1930s, she ""understood long before 2014 that Russia would attack us one day"". Russia soon annexed Crimea and began backing separatists in the Donbas. In April 2014, Ukrainians began forming volunteer self-defence groups to defend against armed separatists. Ms Chornohuz wanted to join but instead became a mother. ""I gave birth to her on the very same day the war officially started,"" she said. The 2014 battles with separatists in the Donbas region revealed a Ukrainian military depleted by corruption and with a Soviet command structure that was big on parades but little else. In short, it looked like a more poorly equipped version of the Russian army that invaded in February. While volunteer groups like the Azov Regiment held the line, the government initiated a Nato-backed defence reform programme. With Western support, Kyiv invested in Nato compatible weapons and training, attempting in a short period to develop a military that allowed junior officers to display some initiative and to integrate the volunteer units that were providing fighters as well as logistics and supply lines. In 2019 Ms Chornohuz joined one of these volunteer units, Hospitallers Ukraine, as a paramedic. But when her partner was killed by a Russian sniper in 2020, she signed a military contract. Initially she found it a challenge to overcome sexism. After serving under a commander who thought women shouldn't be on the front line, she switched to a reconnaissance unit. ""My commander now, he's not sexist,"" she said. Those in her platoon ""just perceive me as an ordinary military worker"". Reporting restrictions imposed by the Ukrainian military mean The Daily Telegraph is not identifying her unit or where they are serving, but in the early days of the invasion, they fought around Mariupol. Amid the turmoil, her husband joined her unit from another and never left, becoming a formal member of it months later. (Her daughter has moved to the US with Ms Chornohuz's ex-husband.) In heavy fighting, the unit held off armoured Russian columns with British-made NLAW anti-tank weapons, but suffered heavy casualties, including the death of their commander and second in command. Five comrades went missing. ""We don't know if they are in Russian captivity or are dead."" At the beginning of the invasion the company evacuated casualties in an armoured vehicle. Later they obtained an ambulance, soon destroyed. Now Ms Chornohuz drives a shrapnelblasted Mitsubishi named Gypsy King with no windows left save for a spiderwebbed windscreen. Their most precious pieces of equipment are the drones: donated civilian models that can be used as artillery spotters or, when fitted with a 3D-printed weapon station, can drop grenades directly on targets. When information gathered during a flight is uploaded to a database, even more intelligence can be gleaned. Combined with strong front-line internet connections provided by donated Starlink systems, the Ukrainian military is moving towards a networkcentric style of warfare, in which units can integrate and communicate with each other - a potent force multiplier to overcome Russia's size advantage. While the Russians are also using drones, they are not as widespread or widely integrated, Ms Chornohuz said. ""Why is the Russian army so big? Because they have no interaction between the units; they have no internet, no phones, they're just thrown on the ground, they don't know where they are, where the mines are, where the Ukrainians are. It's a Soviet army."" In downtime she tries to remember literature, reading poems by French surrealist Paul Eluard - himself a medic in the First World War - or writing poetry of her own. In one, ""About the Truth"", she writes: ""And you dream of a daughter who has been waiting forever for you to return from this war."" Job done Payments rise as refugees minister quits British families who have taken in Ukrainian refugees will see their ""thank you"" payments doubled, the minister in charge of the scheme suggested yesterday as he resigned from the Government. Lord Harrington has stood down after six months as refugees minister, declaring his job as ""essentially complete"". He said he had successfully argued for support payments to families who host refugees in the UK to be doubled from £350 to £700 a month. ""I actually feel now it doesn't need a separate minister because you have got a really good team to do it, and they can report on a monthly basis to the new Secretary of State,"" he said. ""So I felt it was an opportune moment [and] it was not a political statement about this leader or that [leader].""",Broadsheet,0

He should have been careful what he wished for. Le Pen has a fair chance of scooping up the neglected constituency of the old Left, and that could swing the final outcome on April 24. Her economic agenda is a celebration of the welfare state and the French social model. She backed the protest of trade unions against the reform of the pension system in 2019, and again last year over the weakening of unemployment protection, describing President Macron's policies as ""shameful, economically stupid, inhumane, and unjust"". Her plan is a mix of Keynesian big spending and redistribution towards the working poor and young families, those suffering an erosion of real living standards long before commodity inflation hit them with a hammer blow. She has married Left-wing economics with law-and-order nationalism to make a very potent political brew. ""She is a woman of the Left. All her reflexes are of the left,"" said rival Eric Zemmour, who pushed a radically different form of populist capitalism, aiming his fire at the suffocating tyranny of the French tax system. To lump them together misunderstands the political topography of France. Le Pen's plan includes an income tax exemption for the under-30s and low-interest loans of up to (EURO)100,000 (£84,000) for couples starting a family, with debt wiped clean if they have three children. She proposes free public transport for young workers and tax-free overtime pay for the proletariat. She wants to keep the retirement age at 60 for the less privileged who left school early and have put in 40 years of hard labour. She wants to reindex pensions to rising inflation, raise the minimum to (EURO)1,000 a month. She is targeting that large segment of society damaged by global wage arbitrage and by the wealth inequalities of quantitative easing. These are the people neglected by Mr Macron, an Enarque and Rothschild banker, who kicked off his term in office by abolishing the wealth tax. Gilles Ivaldi from the National Centre of Scientific Research says she bet early and hard on social populism and the cost-of-living crisis, speaking to a forgotten ""fragile France"". The gamble has paid off. Macron thought he could coast through this election, deeming himself too busy with the affairs of the world to bother with the hustings. He seems to have assumed that it was enough to keep painting Le Pen and her Rassemblement National as the unreconstructed face of the zenophobic extremism, taking it for granted that voters on the Left would have to back him again. Many will, of course. But this description of Le Pen has lost traction in deep France. The Élysée has been strangely slow to see the danger of her pastoral style of campaigning, and her new, carefully cultivated image as the matron of the nation, photographed with her six cats (she has just got her breeding licence). What you pick up loudly on the street is the unforgiving hatred for Macron among that large, amorphous social strata loosely known as the gilets jaunes, or among those who wince at his cockiness and grandstanding self-importance. A chunk of the 20pc vote for Jean-Luc Melenchon will gravitate to Le Pen in the run-off on April 24. Less clear is how much of the intellectual bourgeois left or the green youth movement will abstain. Le Pen has been turning her party into a statist, anti-globalist, defender of the ModÈle Français ever since taking charge in 2011. It had to ""walk on two legs"", she said. It could never gain power on an anti-immigration ticket alone. This was her way to detoxify the brand, accompanied by a purge of anti-Semites and Vichy nostalgics left from the original Front National. Zemmour made this task easier for her by taking over the ideological fringes of the far Right, even to the point of rehabilitating Marshal Pétain, an odd button to press for an Algerianborn Jew. Zemmour has made her look respectable. Le Pen has stuck doggedly to her bread-and-butter script, resisting the urge to fight the culture war even when part of her base seemed to be drifting away, and when the press was writing her off. The Institut Montaigne thinks her economic plan would cost a net (EURO)105bn a year. Macron himself has been primepumping the economy with (EURO)50bn or more of electoral hand-outs. He has capped the rise in electricity prices to 4pc, for rich and poor alike, at a high cost for the French state. Yet it is Le Pen who is making most of the cost-of-living shock. It is paradoxical that she should be the beneficiary of an upset caused in part by the invasion of Ukraine, given her ties to Vladimir Putin. But unlike Zemmour, or Donald Trump, she has been quick to see the perils of that association. She has backed the open-door policy for Ukrainian refugees. The issue is in any case blurred by Macron's own dealings with Putin, both the decision to host him at presidential summer retreat at Fort Bregancon, and by continuing to legitimise the Russian dictator with biweekly chats even as war crimes accumulate. If Macron tries to play the Kremlin card in the forthcoming televised debate, she will hurl the card straight back at him. Le Pen has not abandoned her Rightwing policies on immigration, nor her defence of France's cultural terroir. She remains a nationalist to the core, and an implacable foe of Jean Monnet's European project. She will endeavour to undermine the primacy of EU law and the hegemony of the Commission from within. One might argue that her agenda smacks of national socialism, but there is no mileage in trying to evoke loose parallels with the 1930s. Le Pen is competing at the ballot box and under the rule of law. Nobody suggests that she plans a 1933 Enabling Act or a French police state once inside the Élysée Palace. Her ideological enemies are Anglo-Saxon globalist capitalism and the EU superstate. It is a Gallic view of the world, through and through. That is why it is so tricky for Macron to counter.

3677,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,26/3/2022,967 words,Nick Allen ; Rozina Sabur,Biden prepared to deploy w y nuclear weapons before Putin; President compares Ukrainian resistance to Tiananmen Square as he makes major policy shift to deter Russia from WMDs,"JOE BIDEN is prepared to use nuclear weapons first in ""extreme circumstances"" as he abandoned plans to drastically water down US policy. His about-turn came after pressure from allies and the Pentagon amid fears that Vladimir Putin may resort to deploying weapons of mass destruction in the coming months. The US allows itself to use nuclear weapons to ""defend the vital interests of the United States, its allies and partners"", and in response to ""significant non-nuclear strategic attacks"". For years Mr Biden has sought to rein that in, arguing that the ""sole purpose"" of the nuclear arsenal should be as a deterrent against such an attack. Stating his position in 2017, Mr Biden said: ""The sole purpose of our nuclear arsenal is to deter and, if necessary, retaliate, for a nuclear attack against the United States and its allies."" He included his desire to minimise the role of nuclear weapons in his 2020 presidential campaign. He was considering announcing such a move earlier this year but the decision was delayed as Russia massed troops on the Ukraine border, it is understood. An arms control expert who consulted with Mr Biden's nuclear policy officials said: ""In the current situation, it's very challenging to make the case for 'sole purpose'. The optics are extremely bad when Russia is being as threatening as it is. You don't want to look weak. ""It was on the president's desk awaiting his decision, then Ukraine happened. Pre-Ukraine there was a chance the president would have gone ahead and made a 'sole purpose' declaration. He wanted to do that but he didn't have a lot of support in the Pentagon."" Mr Biden made the decision as he came under pressure to set a ""red line"" for how to respond to any use of chemical weapons by Mr Putin in Ukraine. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, he said the West would respond ""in kind"", but declined to say whether it would lead to military intervention. In 2020, Russia published a doctrine outlining its possible use of nuclear weapons. It detailed four justifications: a ballistic missile attack against Russia or an ally, use of a nuclear weapon by an enemy, an attack on a Russian nuclear weapons site, or any attack threatening the existence of Russia. Last month, Mr Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be put on high alert. As US president, Mr Biden has the only authority to launch America's nuclear weapons. His new policy will say that the ""fundamental role"" of America's nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attacks, officials told The Wall Street Journal. However, that will still allow them to be used in ""extreme circumstances"" as a deterrent against chemical, biological, massive conventional and cyber attacks, officials added. Allies in Europe had been concerned that Mr Biden's original plan would weaken deterrence against a massive conventional, chemical or biological attack by Russia on Nato. Japan feared the US explicitly limiting itself to retaliation against a nuclear strike could one day leave it open to an conventional attack by China. Supporters of Mr Biden's original, more limited ""sole purpose"" campaign pledge will be disappointed. A member of the nuclear policy community who backed the pledge said: ""With 'sole purpose' you're still safe, you're still saying: 'If you want to nuke us you're going to die.' That's the essence of deterrence. Even Putin would know if he does one or two nukes in Ukraine he can't get away with it."" Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine has delayed the completion of Mr Biden's overall defence strategy, of which the nuclear review is part. The defence strategy was determined to be too focussed on China, and is being amended to acknowledge the increased Russian threat. As he trav- elled to within just 50 miles of Ukraine's border yesterday, the US president compared Mr Putin's invasion of Ukraine to China's massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He described the devastation being unleashed on Ukraine as ""like something out of a science-fiction movie"". But, he added: ""The Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone, they have a lot of guts."" "" He gave the example of a 30-year-old woman standing in front of a tank with a rfle, which recalled the famous ""Tank Man"" photo, of a protester standing defiantly before tanks in China. ""This is Tiananmen Square squared,"" Mr Biden said. Yesterday, Mr Biden addressed US troops in the Polish city of Rzeszow, near the Ukraine border. He said: ""You're in the midst of a fight between democracies and autocrats. What you're doing is consequential, really consequential."" "" The president said he was ""disappointed"" not to be able to see the humanitarian crisis caused by the coflict first-hand. ""They will not let me, understandably, I guess, cross the border and take a look at what's going on in Ukraine,"" he said. More than 3.7million Ukrainians have fled the country, with roughly half of them going to Poland. Andrzej Duda, the Polish president, joined Mr Biden for his event, and thanked the president for his support. He said the Poles see the Ukrainians they are receiving as their guests. ""This is the name we want to apply to them,"" Mr Duda said. ""We do not want to call them refugees. They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbours from Ukraine, who are in a very difficult situation."" Mr Biden is expected to wrap up his European visit today with a ""major address"" in Poland, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said. The president will meet Ukrainian refugees and American humanitarian groups in Warsaw before delivering an address ""that will speak to the stakes of this moment"", Mr Sullivan added. ""He'll also talk about the context and history of this conflict and where he sees it going from here,"" he said.

3679,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,22/3/2022,1057 words,SHERELLE JACOBS,"The woke wars have sapped the West of its ability to fight true evil; Consumed by victimhood and tortured by the past, we have lost the moral clarity of our ancestors","As a new battle of civilisations rages in Ukraine, the culture war continues to rip the West apart. One might have hoped that Vladimir Putin's neo-fascism would have put the West's descent into pointless arguments over ""woke"" trivialities into perspective. With liberty now so openly pitted against authoritarianism, our squabbles over statues and gender pronouns seem grotesquely self-indulgent. In short, this should have been the moment when we rallied around the values that make Western civilisation unique: freedom, individualism, sovereignty, democracy, and the rule of law. Instead the West remains tormented by ideological schisms and self-loathing. During the Cold War, the leaders of the free world confidently framed the West's rift with Russia in bold, striking terms. Its significance was biblical - a conflict between the enlightened forces of liberty and the darkness of communism. Its scripting was Hollywood - a battle between heroes and villains. While the atmosphere could be paranoid and intellectually stifling, and of course there was often disagreement and dissent, sometimes the West also benefited from an astonishing coherence, which held it in good stead until the fall of the USSR. Today, while many have emphasised a positive story of stiff Western resolve over economic sanctions and the revitalisation of Nato, there are more gloomy trends at play, as well. Bids by Joe Biden and Boris Johnson to galvanise their countries with new stories of freedom versus tyranny have fallen flat. On both sides of the Atlantic, the far-Left either rails against Nato ""imperialism"" or calls out Western sympathy for Ukrainian refugees as racist (apparently our solidarity suspiciously exceeds that shown towards victims of war in other countries). Activists remain more energised by what they see as truly Manichaean moral fights: against trans-prejudice, structural racism, and the perils of selfish individualism. The anti-woke Right has become equally muddled on what Western civilisation stands for - and whether it is even worth defending anymore. In the US, some Republicans are so invested in the idea that Biden is the arch symbol of America's decline that their political strategy is to blame him, not Putin, for Russia's invasion. Some populists can still barely conceal their admiration for strongman Putin's bid to resurrect a Russia that claims to uphold Christian, conservative values against the decadence of Western liberalism. The leading US conservative commentator and author of The Death of the West, Pat Buchanan, described Putin as a ""patriot"" and ""traditionalist"" seeking to preserve Russia as a great power. Some of these voices might be deemed ""fringe"", but they also represent an increasingly noisy (and influential) section of our populations. So, no, I can't buy the narrative that Ukraine has saved the West from its self-inflicted existential crisis - one that has left us divided over what we stand for and what makes our societies www.distinct.No wonder, given how our core values are routinely denounced or degraded. Covid has led many to regard liberty as a selfish and dangerous impulse that must be controlled. The progressive optimism that once inspired and propelled our civilisation has disintegrated into nihilistic fatalism. Our intellectual commitment to pluralism has collapsed into a vapid obsession with diversity. The woke preoccupation with slavery and the supposedly unique ""crime"" of British colonialism makes it even more difficult for us to frame the West's conflict with Russia in the most obvious way: between sovereignty and empire. How can we convincingly tell ourselves a story that pits the UK and its allies against the evils of empire so long as we remain trapped in a one-sided and ideological debate that dictates that the West has to atone for its history? On this, as on so many of the other fronts of the culture war, politicians who should be standing up bravely for Western values run scared. In the UK, the Tories have little obvious appetite for a confrontation with the Left: the Government has seemingly abandoned its attempt to challenge the notion that Britain is structurally racist following the vicious backlash against the Sewell report last year. One also detects a lack of intellectual interest. Attending the press launch for the Government's Race Action Plan, I was depressed to hear its Tory overseer Kemi Badenoch argue that it is puzzling that we dedicate so much time to discussing slavery and colonialism given that black people make up 3 per cent of the UK population. Her implication seemed to be that these topics are less relevant to white people. What the centre-Right remains blind to is that it is only by exorcising the ghosts of the West's past that we can answer the questions that haunt us: what does Western civilisation stand for? What is its galvanising mission? How do we rear a society that reveres liberty and agency rather than victimhood and Putin-style big men? The challenge for Western civilisation is not to beg forgiveness for the sins of the past, but to construct a new system that can deliver progress and freedom to all within it, not just a privileged few. This is what neoliberalism tried and failed to do with its universalist utopia of free market globalised freedom. And so here we are, filling the vacuum with a culture war. Ukraine may look to the West as a beacon of liberty but, in truth, we are fast losing our sense of ourselves, consumed by victimhood, tortured by history, ambivalent about democracy, and possessed with a greater hatred for our internal opponents than our external enemies. This is much to the delight of not just Putin, who has declared liberalism ""obsolete"" but also to Xi Jinping, as he seeks to prove that the top-down Chinese model is superior to the ""chaos"" of democracy. Unless the West wins its internal struggle, it simply will not be able to weather a long existential confrontation with authoritarian civilisation states like Russia (and also China). The tragedy is that the stakes are higher than ever for the West, but we have never been more uncertain about what it takes to triumph. follow Sherelle Jacobs on Twitter @Sherelle_E_J; read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/ opinion Ukraine may look to the West as a beacon of liberty but in truth, we are fast losing our sense of ourselves",Broadsheet,0

So far, its team of volunteers has delivered m , humanitarian and military aid to the front line in Ukraine, using vehicles that will then d more than £1.5 million worth of essential supplies. Martin Fletcher joined a convoy","L et me start with a vignette. Having driven across Europe from the improbable starting point of Macclesfield, we arrive at a supermarket in Zaporizhzhya, a city near the front line of the war in Ukraine. An air raid siren sounds, but nobody takes any notice. We hand over a laptop, iPad and outsized television screen to a burly, fatigues-clad former British soldier named Zak who is fighting with the Ukrainian army. Zak, 51, was living in Ukraine before the war. He ran an extreme sports company, and has a Ukrainian son. He now commands 30 men who are battling the Russian invaders. He explains that our equipment will be used in a mobile command centre receiving a live feed from drones flying over Russian positions. 'It will make a huge difference,' he says. Zak talks of how this is the first modern war in which one army must go outside the normal military supply chains to procure vital kit. He talks about the conflict's terrible attrition rate, the incredible 'Blitz spirit' of the Ukrainian soldiers, and how contributions like ours boost their morale as well as their fighting capability. 'They understand what evil is, and they are fighting evil,' he declares. 'That's why I will do everything I can to be here with them.' I ask how many men his unit has lost. 'Twenty-seven,' he replies. Then, suddenly, this seasoned warrior turns and walks away, overcome with emotion. But I'm getting ahead of myself. This story really begins a year ago, when my wife and I agreed to house three Ukrainian refugees - a mother, grandmother and daughter named Svitlana, Nadia and Daria - in our London home. They have been perfect guests - considerate, appreciative and helpful. Daria joined a Ukrainian choir, and in January we attended a concert replete with a tear-jerking rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem and cries of 'Slava Ukraini!' (Glory to Ukraine!). During the interval, I chatted to the woman beside me. She mentioned Anton, a Ukrainian émigré living in Brighton, who delivers aid to his homeland when not serving as an interpreter for the Ukrainian troops training in Britain. An idea took root. Perhaps I could accompany him. Perhaps I could contribute a little more to the war effort by finding a fresh way to write about a conflict that has been raging for 16 months, by personalising it and making the point that it is taking place not in some distant corner of the world but a four-day drive from London. I called Anton. He consented. Then I heard about Macclesfield Ukrainian Aid (MUA), a remarkable group of volunteers from that small Cheshire town, which had already sent out 72 vans and pick-ups carrying more than £1.5 million worth of medical, humanitarian and military aid. The vehicles serve as ambulances, supply trucks and gun platforms. We agreed to join forces, and thus I presented myself one sunny May morning at a welding company on an industrial estate in Macclesfield for the start of MUA's 14th Ukrainian convoy. Volunteers were packing aid into five battered vehicles - a Nissan X-Trail, two Toyota Hiluxes, a Ford Transit van and a 2004 Isuzu pick-up with 114,000 miles on the clock that had been painted olive green overnight because it was destined for the front. The paint was still wet. 'F-k Putin' had been soldered on to the bodywork. Anne Hancock, a retired nurse, and her son, Tom, the welding company's owner, set up MUA. Her father was Ukrainian. At 17, he was seized from his village as the Germans retreated from Russia in 1943 and sent to work in a field kitchen in France. Liberated by the Canadians, he settled in Britain. His family thought he was Polish until - after his death - they discovered the truth and made contact with his relatives in Ukraine. Horrified by Russia's invasion in February last year, the Hancocks appealed for aid on social media. Food, clothes, toys, sleeping bags and generators poured in. Hospitals started donating surplus or out-of-date medicines, bandages, infusion kits, oxygen masks, hazard suits, scanners and a whole operating theatre. It is still coming. 'We just felt we had to do something,' says Hancock. 'The response has been phenomenal.' Separately Jonathan Verney, 61, an Old Harrovian businessman from Chester, had begun sending second-hand vehicles out to Ukraine. He felt compelled to help because a month before the invasion he had been in Mariupol, negotiating the construction of a recycling plant. Being a greatgreat nephew of Florence Nightingale, heroine of the Crimea, probably played a part too. Soon Verney and MUA linked up. With everyone from his cleaner to a wealthy City friend and a rich Ukrainian contact making donations, he purchased the 'end-of-life' vehicles for a few thousand pounds apiece and delivered them to Tom's premises to be rendered roadworthy and loaded with supplies. There is no point in buying newer vehicles because most are 'shot to pieces' in weeks, Verney explains. 'It's costing me a fortune,' Tom protests, before adding: 'It's the most satisfying thing I've ever done.' Before leaving, Rick Mobbs, 60, a former soldier and volunteer driver, gives us a security briefing. Nurse the vehicles, he tells us. Stay in convoy. Turn off our mobiles at the Ukrainian border. Post nothing on social media. This is Mobbs' eighth trip to postinvasion Ukraine. 'I'm a Cold War soldier. I've been fighting the Russians since 1982,' he explains. On the overnight ferry from Hull to Rotterdam, I learn more about my fellow drivers. Ruth Moore, 51, is a former police force manager whose Jewish grandparents were hidden by a Dutch family during the Second World War. 'If it wasn't for the kindness of strangers I wouldn't be here. This is my act of kindness to strangers,' she says. Hans Daams, 68, a Dutch retiree, is inspired by his mother: aged 17, she risked her life by smuggling leaflets through Nazi checkpoints in Utrecht as a member of the Resistance. Dmytro Kryvko, 34, a video designer, fled when the Russians overran Melitopol, his home city, last year and came to Britain with his wife and daughter. Unable to fight because of a medical condition, this is his way of helping his country. A retired doctor from Edinburgh, the owner of a first aidtraining company from Tamworth and Verney complete our group. The next day we drive 629 miles across Germany. The day after, we cross Poland, stopping at a Benedictine abbey near the Ukrainian border to collect emergency medical packs for soldiers. Four priests and six nuns live here, along with 30 Ukrainian refugees. Father Marek, the senior priest, tells me he has no problem storing non-lethal military equipment. What about weapons, I ask? 'I'd have to ask the bishop,' he grins. That evening we reach the Ukrainian border at Korczowa to find a long, stationary line of vehicles ahead. Spotting our British number plates, a young Ukrainian woman knocks on the window of every vehicle in front of us, asking if we can go first because we are bringing aid and have come so far. All readily agree, but the Polish border guards send us back. We talk to our neighbours while waiting. The van next to us is bringing hospital beds from Germany. The young Ukrainian woman behind is delivering her 14th Polish vehicle to the front line, all in her spare time. A greyhaired man, told he was too old to enlist as a soldier, is delivering his 39th. Probably a third of the queuing vehicles are delivering support to Ukraine. It takes four hours to negotiate the border bureaucracy. We reach Lviv shortly before the 11pm curfew. The streets are deserted. We have driven another 538 miles. The next morning, we transfer the Hiluxes to a de-mining organisation, and the medical packs to Medics4Ukraine. Kryvko visits a dentist because it is cheaper here. Verney and I wander around Lviv's lovely Hapsburg-era heart. It is hard to tell there's a war on. Children head for school, workers to their jobs. The cobbled streets are freshly washed. The trams are running. Tulips ring the famous opera house. Coffee kiosks do brisk business. But the city cemetery tells another story: some 200 soldiers' coffins await burial, each adorned with a Ukrainian flag. Back at the hotel we meet a plucky young woman named Uliana. She had accosted Verney on a previous trip to ask if he could find a vehicle for her husband, a former computer repairman now fighting near Bakhmut. He delivered one in 10 days. Our Isuzu is now destined for her husband's colleague. She is full of gratitude. 'It's so nice to know people are not forgetting our problems,' she says. I ask how she and her two children are coping. 'When someone from the family is fighting, all the family is fighting,' she replies. 'It's very hard, but I know if he wasn't there, another father or son would be there in his place.' Leaving Lviv, Anton and I get lost. We find ourselves on a dirt track leading through rustic villages. We stop a man in a car who leads us to the right road. Then, astonishingly, he gives us a $100 note. 'For our army,' he says. Anton, a Brighton & Hove Albion fan, recounts how he gave an acquaintance his ticket for a match while we're away. When he next looked at his crowdfunding page, the recipient had donated £1,100. As Verney says: 'Every man and his dog wants to do something to help.' We drive through forests and across great plains. In every town, flags fly over fresh graves in cemeteries. As we near Kyiv, the war really begins to intrude. Road signs have been painted over to confuse invaders. Billboards proclaim join up for our victory, turn your anger into your weapon and heroes don't die. We drive through manned and unmanned checkpoints. On the edge of the capital, we pass the charred shells of homes and shops. Anton, 44, lived in Kyiv until his parents moved to Britain when he was 15. That night he shows me the somewhat depopulated city of golden domes. In St Volodymyr's Cathedral, a priest tells us: 'We are burying more than we are marrying.' He introduces us to a young widow. We commiserate, but say she must be proud her husband died fighting for his country. 'All our soldiers are heroes,' she says. We pass statues boarded up for protection against missile strikes. In St Michael's Square we inspect the burnt remains of Russian tanks, and the wall of the monastery, which is covered in thousands of photos of dead soldiers. We walk through Independence Square where, arguably, the present war was triggered back in 2013. Vast crowds gathered to protest President Yanukovych's decision to align Ukraine with Moscow instead of the European Union. Yanukovych fled, but Russia responded by seizing Crimea. We leave Kyiv early the next morning. The road south is lined with sandbagged foxholes and the bridges are all guarded. Thousands of steel girder tank traps stand ready to block roads. We activate the air raid app on our phones, and soon a disembodied voice warns: 'Attention! Attention! Shelling attack alert! Proceed to the nearest shelter.' But we see nothing, and after several such warnings we cease to worry. Near Dnipro we deliver the contents of our transit van to a church group supporting women and children rendered homeless by the war. There is food, sanitary products, nappies, toothpaste and shampoo, all donated by the people of Macclesfield, plus cards drawn by its schoolchildren. The grown-ups give us pizza. A young girl gives us dandelions. I leave the convoy to visit our London refugees' relatives. Nadia's brother, his wife, two daughters and grandson were driven from their home in Donetsk by the invasion. When Nadia left, they squeezed into her one-bedroom flat. It is an emotional meeting. I give them Coronation chocolates, biscuits and tea towels sent by Svitlana in, somewhat incongruously, a Fortnum & Mason bag. They give me a handmade teddy. They say Dnipro's air defences now bring down most Russian missiles, but not all: 'When the dogs bark and the alarms go off, we know they've landed not far from here.' They try not to accept humanitarian aid because others need it more. Irena makes camouflage netting for front-line units in her spare time. I have to rejoin the convoy so we hug and part with cries of 'Slava Ukraini! Slava Brytaniyi!' I learn later that they had cooked me dinner. At 3.30am an alarm sounds inside my hotel room, warning of another air strike. I fall straight back to sleep. Our final day is the most moving. Leaving Dnipro, we stop at a monument to Putin's barbarity: a nine-storey apartment block destroyed by a Russian missile in January. Forty-six people were killed, including several children. The fronts of the flats were ripped away, exposing tattered wallpaper, ovens, bookshelves, plastic flowers, clothes in a wardrobe, a potty - poignant reminders of domestic life. A bus stop opposite is now a shrine, filled with teddy bears. We drive on to our final destination, Zaporizhzhia, a city bristling with soldiers and refugees scarcely 30 miles from the front line, and not much further from a giant nuclear power station controlled by the Russian military and the Kakhovka reservoir whose dam was recently destroyed. We meet Zak before coming to rest in the station car park, precisely 2,069 miles from Macclesfield. A soldier arrives to collect the green Isuzu, a thermal scope and a drone. He says the vehicle will be used as a machine-gun platform. It's like saying goodbye to an old friend. Another soldier approaches simply to thank us for our work. A policewoman forced to flee her home town, Polohy, hugs us all. Kryvko discovers old friends at a nearby centre for refugees from his native Melitopol, and sobs as he embraces them. Olexsandr, a business associate of Verney, takes the Transit van away for use as a front-line delivery vehicle. Then Vladimir arrives to fetch the last pick-up. An offshore engineer in civilian life, the 45-yearold has spent the past 15 months clearing buildings, trenches and woods of Russian soldiers - one of the most dangerous tasks. He has discharged himself from hospital and walks with a crutch following a shrapnel wound. Vladimir says he has not seen his wife and children for eight months. He has lost more than 30 colleagues. He shows us video clips of dead Russian soldiers, of a mortar attack in which 11 comrades died, and of the ruined buildings his men inhabit for days at a time. How does he cope, I ask? 'After each mission we remove the memory card from our brain,' he replies. Will he return to the front line? Of course, he says. 'My duty will finish when we finish with the Russians.' But, he asks rhetorically: 'When will my luck run out?' Vladimir thanks us for the aid. 'Without support from your country we would not have survived this long,' he says. By way of a gift he gives Verney a bayonet taken from a Russian he had killed. He then hugs us all and drives away, leaving us distinctly damp-eyed. We catch the sleeper train back to Lviv, passing trains carrying tanks to the front for the longawaited counter-offensive that Ukraine launched last month. Mission complete? Not quite. Verney has a new shopping list - secure communication devices for Zak, drones for Vladimir, diabetic medicines for a doctor in a refugee centre. We share a compartment with Tatiana, a frontline medic whose husband was killed 40 days earlier. She asks for neck braces and blood coagulants. As I fall asleep, Verney is on his mobile, buying a second-hand pick-up from someone in Inverness, hunting down coagulants, preparing for the next convoy. 'I'm aware that what I'm doing is a drop in the ocean,' he tells me. 'But so many others are doing the same that those drops are becoming a tidal wave.'

Forth Ports also said it could not accommodate asylum seekers in Leith docks after the Home Office approached the council seeking to commission the MS Victoria, a cruise ship that has been used for Ukrainian refugees. The moves represent the latest blow to the Home Office's efforts to transfer migrants out of hotels, where some 46,000 are being housed at a cost of £6million a day. It follows thwarted plans to use cruise ships on the Mersey in Wirral and in city docks in London. It came as it emerged the Home Office is working on plans to house migrants in marquees on large sites. This is in addition to plans to house more than 3,000 migrants on RAF bases Scampton in Lincolnshire and Wethersfield in Essex. The Home Office said yesterday that more than 3,000 migrants crossed the Channel by small boat in June, a record month for the year so far and already ahead of last June's total.",Broadsheet,0
3705,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,28/1/2023,1305 words,CAMILLA TOMINEY,"The Tories desperately need a Boris comeback; His star factor hasn't gone away, and it could help win over Red Wall voters - but only if the PM welcomes him back to front-line politics","Sir Rod Stewart has always been the people's pop star. When he isn't too busy belting out Baby Jane, Maggie May and other greatest hits, he's filling in potholes or renting homes for Ukrainian refugees. And his wife, Penny Lancaster, is a special police constable - so while they may be multi-millionaires, it's fair to conclude this glorious couple have got their celebrity feet on the ground. All of which is to say: there's a problem when Sir Rod, who previously associated with Conservatism, calls for the Tories to stand aside and hand over power to Labour. Indeed, it was just a few years ago that the rocker praised Boris Johnson for winning the general election, tweeting: ""Well done, Boris."" He had backed Boris before, on the basis that when it came to Brexit, the then prime minister would get to grips with it. ""We're in a muddle, but I think Boris will sort it out. We have to be patient,"" Sir Rod said. Fast forward to this week and the 78-year-old said it was time to ""change the bloody Government"". Speaking out in support of nurses, he added: ""I personally have been a Tory for a long time but I think this Government should stand down now and give the Labour Party a go at it. This is heartbreaking for the nurses, it really is heartbreaking. In all my years of living in this country I've never seen it so bad. This is a bad time for us in Great Britain, it really is."" Now, the trouble for Rishi Sunak is that Sir Rod's view reflects the mood among many disgruntled Tories - even if they wouldn't go so far as to endorse Labour publicly. But as is ever the case with this Government of seemingly shy Conservatives and timid Thatcherites, there was no attempt to win back Sir Rod. There was no alternative case made. There never is. The official response to these sorts of outbursts is very much in the vein of the singer's 1975 hit, I Don't Want to Talk About It. And that way lies disaster. As elections guru Isaac Levido told the Cabinet during its away-day at Chequers on Thursday, solid adherence to a core Tory message is vital. The key is communicating that message - not just clearly, but constantly. Yes, the party may be 20 points behind Labour, but polling is ""a mile wide and an inch deep"", in the words of Sir Iain Duncan Smith. The next election doesn't have to be a repeat of 1997, when Labour was led by a charismatic son-of-a-Tory willing to cleave off Conservative policies. Blair was light years ahead of Starmer. This year, voters could yet forgive the Tories for their trespasses so they can be delivered from the evils of Starmer's socialist offering - but they can't do it if Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt remain as lesser spotted as they are currently. While it's all very well and good that the Prime Minister and Chancellor are ""working hard behind the scenes"", what the disheartened public really needs right now is the sort of high-profile plain speaking we have heard from Sir Rod. Forget speeches to half-empty factories (or in Mr Hunt's case yesterday, Bloomberg HQ, of all places), we need to hear our most senior politicians vocally making the case for Conservatism, day in, day out, on the streets and in marketplaces, between now and the next election. Dare I say it, but what they really need is a bish, bash Boris approach to communications. It was probably a coincidence, but nevertheless emblematic, that just a day after Boris's ""What the hell are we waiting for?"" rallying cry, Germany and the US finally followed the UK in making a historic pledge to supply heavy battle tanks to Ukraine. While I appreciate how much groundwork was laid in bilateral conversations between the world leaders, like him or loathe him, Mr Johnson does have an uncanny feel for the zeitgeist on these issues, simply by listening to the public mood and telling it like it is. Other leaders are less talented. In the days preceding Boris's intervention, German chancellor Olaf Scholz was shaky on sending Leopards, as was Joe Biden on providing Abrams M1s. But as pressure mounted, the US President ended up echoing Mr Johnson's punchy words, declaring: ""This is about freedom. Putin expected Europe and the US to weaken our resolve. He expected our support for Ukraine to crumble with time. He was wrong."" I would go as far as to say that if ever there was a reminder that Mr Johnson still has an important role to play in public life, then it is the Ukraine war. Sometimes you see the best of politicians when they are animated by one particular topic. When Boris talks about Ukraine, you see the man who won in 2019. Of course, this doesn't mean returning as prime minister. Some ethical questions about his tenure in Downing Street need to be answered before that even becomes a consideration. But if the current occupants of Downing Street and Conservative headquarters cannot appreciate Boris's value as an ambassador for the Tory brand, then they shouldn't expect to win the next election, frankly. Boris's critics would say that he's anathema to the parts of the country he cannot reach - and they may well be right - but he still remains Heinekenesque to the parts he can reach, like the Red Wall. In November, polling guru Professor John Curtice calculated that loyalty to the Conservatives among 2016 Leave voters had nosedived by a staggering 30 points. Even those who blame Mr Johnson for this can surely agree that he may now be the best person - indeed the only person - who stands any chance of winning them back. There's also a parliamentary benefit for Rishi in this. Both Liz Truss and he struggled to hold sway with rebellious Red Wall MPs. But these same backbenchers owe their seats to Boris and his campaign. Perhaps he can soothe the relationship between them and the whips' office. Moreover, as the man who won London not once but twice - and with the party's few remaining London MPs facing the prospect of electoral annihilation come 2024 - why not unleash him in the capital, against Sadiq Khan's awful record? After all, there's no better example of the difference between a bad Labour leader and a good Tory one than the recent history of London. A flourishing international hub under Boris Johnson's mayoralty, with violent crime falling at an extraordinary pace, the city is now riddled with problems, with serious increases in robbery and knife crime. You can't park your car without worrying about losing your catalytic converter or hold your phone without imagining it being snatched from your hand by a yob on a scooter. Meanwhile, Sadiq Khan's mismanagement has cost London's transport network, as I highlight below, billions of pounds in lost revenue, waste and bailouts. So why not get the former mayor in London's radio stations, making these comparisons in his own, entertaining fashion? In any case it is safe to predict we will be seeing more of the former prime minister in the coming weeks and months. He seems more willing now to appear on camera to sit down for personal interviews. He increasingly looks like a man wanting to redeem himself and defend his record in government. Yes, there is also the small matter of his appearance before the Commons privileges committee in March, which his critics hope will finish him off for good. But his Tory detractors ought to be careful what they wish for. If the proceedings are televised, as planned, then I suspect they will only reinforce Boris's status as the only Conservative capable of arousing more than a ""meh"" reaction from the average voter. And that is the point Rishi Sunak would do well to heed. When you're fighting for your political life, visibility is key. If that cannot be done by the current Prime Minister, he ought to explore ways to get a helping hand from the only living Tory with Sir Rod Stewart's star factor.

3713,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,23/9/2022,1366 words,Colin Freeman,"Jailed, whipped, in exile: the Russian band who won't stop taunting Putin; A decade of Kremlin repression - and Western disdain - hasn't quashed Pussy Riot's spirit. They tell Colin Freeman what drives them","Just a few hours ahead of their gig at the University of Kent, Russian punk collective Pussy Riot are laughing at a clip of a chat show in which Kremlin MPs discuss the Ukraine war. The politicians are debating Russia's next move, and their suggestions are not the kind of thing you hear on the BBC's Question Time. One MP suggests nuking Britain, saying: ""If we turn the British Isles into a Martian desert in three minutes flat, Nato won't respond."" Then the Pussy Riot giggles stop. ""After years of hearing this kind of stuf, we make jokes about it, but of course it's not funny - it's frightening, evil,"" says Maria Alyokhina, 34, one of the group's founding members. ""It took the Nazis years to come up with this kind of propaganda - Russia has taken just a few months."" Nobody can say that Pussy Riot didn't warn us. Ten years ago, they became the balaclava-clad face of Russia's protest movement, after sneaking into a Moscow cathedral to perform a raucous ""punk prayer"" against Vladimir Putin. In outrage terms, it was Russia's answer to the Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen, although the penalties were more than just tabloid fury. Maria and two others were jailed for ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred"". Since then, the collective have toured the world, their mix of Slavic girl power and LGBT politics earning namechecks from Madonna and Hillary Clinton. They have been jailed multiple further times, pepper-sprayed and whipped. Human-rights groups have declared them ""prisoners of conscience"". God-fearing Putin supporters suspect they may be witches. But for a long time, their warnings that the Russian president's rule was becoming a dystopian nightmare seemed perhaps overblown. Not any more. When we meet at the Canterbury campus on Wednesday, the band are digesting Putin's comments the night before that he is not ""bluffing"" in his threat to use nuclear weapons against the West. He has also announced the mobilisation of 300,000 army reservists to try to turn the tide in the war. In his refusal to accept that Ukraine is no longer Russia's vassal state, Alyokhina says that Putin is acting like an abusive husband. ""It is like a domestic violence case. The aggressor cannot accept that the other partner now wants to live independently."" She has already quit Putin's controlling ifluence. Having served six jail stints in the past 18 months alone - she was behind bars when Putin invaded in February - Alyokhina was put under house arrest upon release, with security agents watching her flat. Rather like the Russian military's performance in Ukraine, however, they proved less formidable than one might expect. She escaped by the simple ruse of dressing as a food courier, leaving her phone behind to avoid being tracked. In April, she crossed into Lithuania, aided by a travel document issued by a friendly European country. She has now hooked up with current bandmates Olga Borisova, Diana Burkot and Taso Pletner, who left using their normal passports. Despite the tensions with Europe, Russians are still largely free to come and go - although whether Pussy Riot would be advised to return home is another question entirely. It is fair to say that their European tour - scheduled for the student circuit in Britain, as well as Ireland and Norway - is unlikely to win rave reviews in the Russian state media. The content, a blend of performance art and industrial techno, is a none-too-subtle rant against the ""bitch"" Putin, who ""Botoxed his cheeks and puffed up his chest"". Ticket revenues, meanwhile, will go to help Ukrainian refugees. Putin supporters may regard such benefit gigs as treason. So can they really return home afterwards? ""Er... physically, yes,"" says Borisova, 28. A pause follows, suggesting that this is not an option to be taken lightly. ""Right now, though, we are focusing on our tours and raising money for Ukraine, rather than being arrested and silenced."" On which note, should you wish to see them in action, it may also be worth girding yourself by watching their acclaimed 2013 documentary, Pussy Rpot: A Punk Prfyer. It charts the origins of the group's ethos - a protest not just against Putin's government, but the macho, traditional Russian Orthodox values he has promoted, with young women encouraged to breed for Mother Russia. Musically, their early influences included British bands such as the Angelic Upstarts, whose song Polpce Oppresspon they once sampled, but in the true spirit of punk, the message always mattered more. The documentary shows footage of their infamous 2012 performance at Christ the Saviour Cathedral, when they leapt around the altar shouting ""Mother of God, Rid us of Putin"". A furious nun chases them, shouting: ""God will judge you!"" So too did the Russian courts, which sentenced Alyokhina and two other then members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, to two years each in jail - not that it acted as much deterrent. Two months after being released, Alyokhina gave another gig upstaging Putin's showcase Winter Olympics in Sochi, when she was whipped by Cossack security guards. The cathedral protest appalled the Russian Orthodox faithful, who struggle even with the group's name. ""The best translation is 'deranged vaginas',"" one baffled Orthodox believer tells the documentary. Yet the band's ire was directed not at the church itself, but its head, Patriarch Kirill, for supporting Vladimir Putin's conservative, imperialist vision. At the time of the protest, Kirill was little-known in the West, despite widespread reports that he once worked for the KGB. Since the Ukraine invasion, however, the cleric has become notorious as the war's chief cheerleader, praising Russian troops as heroes. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, has denounced Kirill for ""actively supporting a war of aggression"". Kirill was even put on an EU sanctions list in June, but was later removed after objections from Hungary. ""There is no such thing as an ex-KGB agent - Kirill is just Putin in plain clothes,"" says Alyokhina, who doesn't hide her frustration at Western caution on sanctions. Had Europe taken as tough a line on Putin over Russia's 2014 invasion and subsequent annexation of the Crimean peninsula as it did over Russian cheating in the Olympics, she says, things might be very different. ""Europe cares about doping scandals, not activists in jail."" Might her fellow Russians now rise up and get rid of Putin, given the war's rising body count and the mobilisation calls? ""Many Russians are still doing protest stuf f despite the risk of prison, but the state has more resources than the protesters,"" she says. ""Another Orange Revolution [the protests in Ukraine between 2004-05] could happen, but only with international solidarity."" Our interview time comes to an end - to the relief of Canterbury's events staf, who have noted that, thus far, the band have not got round to doing rehearsals. Yet, watching their show later - performed to a mix of students and curious locals - I am not sure anyone would have noticed. To a cacophony of industrial techno music, interspersed with drums and whistles, the group perform a loose narration of their battles in Russia, their lyrics subtitled in English on a giant screen showing footage of protests and menacing security police. Raw, tuneless and discordant, it makes punkettes such as The Slits look like the Nolan Sisters. Yet it is also captivating. These are musicians for whom an antiauthoritarian stance is not just a rock-star posture. By comparison, Western agit-pop bands such as Rage Against the Machine sound just Mildly Annoyed. Like all good punks, though, Pussy Riot are always innovating, and have new stunts to get up Putin's nose. ""We have been invited for a gig in Kyiv,"" says Maria, when I ask what happens after the scheduled tour finishes. The venue and dates are still to be confirmed. But if any Kyiv promoters have a club with a missile bunker, perhaps they'll soon get a call.

3741,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,4/3/2023,2882 words,NA,'Bad Fergie sold papers',"Ask the Duchess of York what the best piece of advice Queen Elizabeth ever gave her was, and she doesn't have to think about it for a second. 'Be yourself, Sarah. All anyone wants is for you to just be yourself.' She gives a wistful smile. 'I've always found that hard. It's taken me this long to get there.' This surprises me. I always thought the 63-year-old was ahead of her time in the 'being herself ' department: a 'take me or leave me' trailblazer. From the whimsical Lindka Cierach dress she chose to wear when she married Prince Andrew in 1986 and the way she navigated both their divorce and her royal exit six years later, to her reinvention as a New York Times bestselling author, the Duchess has never struck me as someone hemmed in by convention. Certainly, the woman sitting across the table from me in The River Café now - still in full make-up from our shoot, wearing an asymmetrical black and white blazer by a Spanish brand - is 100 proof, neat 'Fergie', asking our waitress where she's from in Poland, and telling her about the trip to Warsaw she took last year as part of the work she's doing with Ukrainian refugees for her charity, Sarah's Trust. And it's easy to see why the Queen remained so close to her warm, energetic former daughter-inlaw, even entrusting her corgis to the Duchess after she died. 'Every day I look at Muick and Sandy and want to say, ""It's all right.""' Sarah shakes her head. 'HM used to give them little bits of digestive biscuits, so after lunch now I'll crack up a biscuit for them and deliberately make that same noise.' She and the late Queen Elizabeth enjoyed long chats on their regular dog walks over the years, and the Duchess's eyes grow sheeny as she tells me about the late monarch's 'ability to listen and never judge'. 'She was able to completely and utterly dilute chaos. And still carry on. And still smile. And still go through everything that she went through.' Even to those of us who never met Queen Elizabeth, that idea of her being able to 'dilute chaos' rings so true. I've always imagined that our late monarch must have been much more forgiving and understanding than others of her generation - about the ups and downs of life, about mistakes and such things as divorce? 'She understood all of it. Everything. And it wasn't even about forgiving, but a way of life. Duty, sense of purpose, but of course never judgment.' The Duchess will always be grateful to have had 'even a minute of HM's time', she tells me. 'Because also, during the last three years, her poor son [Prince Andrew] has been going through such a tumultuous time, and I think HM was very relieved I could help her with him, so we became even closer, then. 'But I've always admired and adored her. Really, she was more of a mother to me than my mother.' On the subject of Prince Andrew, I ask whether these past three years have made her tightknit family even closer, but shereplies with a question of her own, asking how I would feel if, say, my own daughter fell over at school? 'You want to say: ""Get up, come on, it's fine!"" You don't want her to be hurting. And I think it's really sad to see what Andrew has been through.' And was Queen Elizabeth confident that Sarah would be there for Prince Andrew when she no longer could be? 'She knew,' she confirms quietly. 'I will always be there. Always. Because I love her.' This level of openness so early on in our interview is disarming. I've met the Duchess before on a number of occasions, as well as her daughters, Princesses Beatrice, 34, and Eugenie, 32 - who are both strikingly kind and easy-going - and I had hoped she would feel comfortable with me. But we're here to talk about her new Mills & Boon novel, A Most Intriguing Lady, and given the herd of elephants in the room today - from the latest twist in Prince Andrew's court settlement with Virginia Giuffre, to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the reverberations of his memoir, Spare - I had expected to find her more guarded. Remembering a line from an interviewer who once described the Duchess as wearing her heart not so much on her sleeve as from 'head to toe', I quote it. She liked that line, she says. I wonder whether despite the problems it has caused her over the years, part of her just doesn't want to be a tightly zipped person.Her forthrightness is infectious. Whether in the photographic studio earlier or here in the restaurant, people are drawn into 'Fergie's' emotional vortex and offer up confidences immediately. Within minutes there's hugging, hand pressing. There's Fergie, sending her best wishes to sick relatives she's never met, and handing out life mantras to people who were strangers only minutes ago. 'It's the storyteller in me,' she explains. 'I'm naturally curious - always have been.' Like the Duchess, Lady Mary, the heroine of her new novel, is acutely observant and fascinated by people. Inspired by one of Sarah's own ancestors - her great-great-aunt, Lady Mary Montagu Douglas Scott - she forms an unlikely alliance with the dashing Colonel Walter Trefusis in order to solve a crime, and quickly finds herself falling for her fellow sleuth. As with the Duchess's first foray into Mills & Boon in 2021, the novel was co-written with historical romance author Marguerite Kaye. 'We call our writing process ""collabor-writing"",' she tells me, 'because it's a real two-way thing. Our text goes back and forth between us, and we'll chat on the phone pretty much daily.' Mills & Boon felt like a natural fit for a woman who has always craved the kind of uplifting escapism the books provide. 'It's that promise of a feel-good fix,' she says. 'And I love celebration, I love romance, I love anything that takes me into joy.' She frowns, the twitch of a smile at the corners of her mouth. 'I take joy very seriously indeed.' For the first book to have been a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic was unhoped for. 'I feel really proud to be a new novelist in my 60s! Like my life is just beginning,' she enthuses. 'And I've told Jeffrey Archer that I want to beat him with this one.' Now, the Duchess admits she is 'in talks for a major US TV series involving both books'. She gives a Cheshire cat grin. 'It's very exciting. You know, I've wanted to be a romantic novelist for 20 years or more, and I never gave up on my dream.' One of her favourite quotes comes from the great Sidney Poitier, she says: 'It's difficult when you're carrying other people's dreams. You have to hold on to the dream that's inside yourself and know if you're true to that, that's really all that matters.' I'm assuming this is a reference to all the baggage that comes with marrying into the Royal family. Baggage that didn't disappear with her divorce. And, of course, Sarah could teach Gwyneth Paltrow a thing or two about 'conscious uncoupling'. Whatever your view may be on her enduring loyalty to her exhusband, with whom she still lives at Royal Lodge when in the UK, she seems to have pulled offthat rare feat: an amicable divorce. 'I think we have an amazing mutual understanding of one another,' she explains. 'We've always been like that. Also, we both hate confrontation.' As for the Poitier quote, she'll only explain its significance obliquely. 'I think that for those to whom a lot of responsibility is given you must always remember that the minute you walk out your front door, you need to be electable but never elected.' The Duchess dons an earnest expression. 'Remember that the dream of every little girl is to be a princess, and I was a princess. And I loved every minute of it.' I stare at her. Sorry: what? She can't possibly have loved every minute. When Sarah became the first royal to sit down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1996, she told the US chat show host that royal life was 'not a fairy tale'. 'The thing is,' she counters today, 'I had the great honour of being the Queen's daughter-in-law, and therefore I couldn't not see every single second as a great learning curve.' OK. But having to get all dressed up for royal functions? 'Loved it.' Having to sit through those functions? 'Loved it. Loved it.' She breaks off, drizzles some balsamic over her mozzarella salad, and resumes. 'Listen, if every little girl's dream is to be a princess, then your job is to uphold that dream. So I don't ever want to let it down.' Particularly now, after Queen Elizabeth's death, the Duchess goes on, 'it's unbelievably important to uphold Her Majesty's legacy. And although I'm not a member of the Royal family any more, my values are what I believe is right - and that's what they uphold.' For that reason, she has always said to her daughters: 'Even when you're just walking out of your own front door, always smile. Uphold all www.that.No one wants to see a grumpy princess.' I burst out laughing, and the Duchess joins in. 'Is that going to be your headline?' she jokes. Probably. I mean, I hate to point out the obvious, but someone has killed the dream quite dramatically, haven't they? By being a very grumpy 'princess' indeed. Sarah raises an eyebrow. She's going to make me say it. I'm talking about Meghan Markle, I say leadenly. The Duchess takes a bite of her salad; chews for a moment. 'I don't really know Meghan. I haven't really met her. I spoke to her at the funeral, and I thought she looked absolutely beautiful. I think she is beautiful.'No argument there. But has she damaged the Royal family? 'It is absolutely not my place to answer that,' says the Duchess in a single exhalation. 'She has made Harry very happy, and that is so nice. Honestly, he's so happy with her. She really loves him. And I think that's beautiful - and that Diana would be proud of him and her lovely grandchildren.' Did she watch the Netflix documentary? She widens her eyes but stays silent. When I repeat the question, the Duchess holds up a finger: 'I'm just trying to think? Right.' She's formulated a response. 'So, I think I'm a devourer of information on Netflix.' OK? 'And I love watching everything on Netflix.' What am I supposed to do with that? She chuckles. 'I also think that one day I'd like to do a documentary.' A similar one? 'I don't know. I can't be led,' she says, shutting me down. 'Not on this.' Does she think Diana would have liked Meghan, I venture? Tilting her head to one side the Duchess deadpans: 'I feel sorry for you.' Still laughing at the putdown, I try something else: given the Duchess also relocated to the US after leaving the Royal family, does she think fleeing Britain really will turn out to be Prince Harry's best chance at happiness? 'I can't speak for him,' she says with a small sigh, 'but I will say that after I got divorced, I spent 12 years in America, writing books, and it was a wonderful place for me. I felt free there. And I can't thank Americans enough for the way they were with me. So,' she nods, 'I can understand why he would [do that].' For a moment, Sarah looks dejected. 'Why do people always judge?' she asks quietly. 'They can have a view, but don't put someone down to have that view.' It's a fair point, particularly when you consider the judgments thrown at 'Fergie' over the years. And of course, women get it far worse than men. 'Over 30 years,' she says. 'It started in August 1988.' Tonelessly, Sarah runs through some of the worst headlines: '""The Duchess of Pork""; ""82 per cent would rather sleep with a goat than Fergie."" Shall I go on?' Then there was the pitting of her against Diana. 'All the time. Everywhere. Because Diana was beautiful and tall, running out of the gym, and I was fat, frumpy Fergie coming behind. Sometimes ""fat, frumpy, frolicking Fergie"". Lots of ""fs"".' Was the Princess of Wales sympathetic? 'We both supported each other.' The Duchess of York had a welldocumented binge-eating disorder which, understandably, got worse around that time. 'For 10 years all that caused me to have even more of a problem. Bad Fergie sold papers. Bad Fergie still sells papers.' But her difficult relationship with food started years before that, she says. 'From the age of 15, I was never thin enough. Good enough. Correct enough. I didn't take things seriously enough. Everything was never enough.' Where does she think that feeling comes from? 'Oh I know where it comes from.' The daughter of Major Ronald Ferguson and his first wife, Susan, came from what Sarah once described as 'country gentry with a bit of old money'. As a child she loved horse riding and won many cups. But when she was 12, her parents separated and within a few years her mother had eloped with an Argentinian polo player. 'Why would your own mother leave you?' she asks. 'Can you imagine it? So how could I possibly have managed? 'Then, when I got to 15 my sister went to live in Australia, and I was left with Dad.' She shakes her head. 'That must be really bad for someone, mustn't it? To have so much punishment? To be abandoned? But you know, I think that's why I'm such a good mother.' Was she never able to 'fix' the eating disorder: that feeling she was never good enough? 'No. I think you learn to live with what Martin Luther King called ""the inaudible language of the heart"".' Doing things for others has been more therapeutic than anything else, she admits. Her work on children's education, most recently as an ambassador for Montessori schools (she will be announcing plans for a new charitable fund later this year), has been deeply rewarding, she says. The blind Ukrainian children's choir she welcomed here just before Christmas, 'so uplifting'. 'But I have many scars,' she says, 'and my scars are really, really big. Because they have come from major obstacles.' She tells me about the moment she broke down in tears, earlier in the week, in the middle of a meeting at London's Berkeley hotel about the promotion of A Most Intriguing Lady. Suddenly it all 'became too much for my strength to cope with', she explains. 'And I just thought: ""I can't.""' Because she probably feels she has to be strong for everyone else? 'I do have to be at the moment, yes. Because it has been?' She pauses, presses her lips together, as if to stop herself from saying more. Then: 'When Andrew went through a hard time, I used to be able to throw it to The Boss?' But she can't do that now. 'No.' We're finishing our desserts when she points out that I'm wrong about 'women getting it worse than men'. 'Perception is? so important. It can make or break someone. And I'm living with someone - at least when I'm in England and lucky enough to be a guest at Royal Lodge - and I see what that perception has done to a very kind man. I really mean that.' After almost two hours with Sarah, I can see that she really does 'take joy very seriously indeed'. Because the moments of despondency always end on an up-note: a reason to feel grateful. 'It's just amazing how good a grandfather Andrew is,' she's telling me now, her face brightening at the thought of her grandchildren. Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank had baby August in 2021, just a few months before Princess Beatrice welcomed a daughter, Sienna, with husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. 'To the point that I've got FOMO,' she says with a laugh. 'That I worry he's a better grandparent than me! And it's lovely to see after what he's been through. He was always very good with his mum, who adored him. And now he's very good as a grandfather.' Our time together is coming to an end, and Sarah is ordering a slice of the Chocolate Nemesis cake to take away, because, she tells our waitress, 'my ex-husband loves it'. The Duchess has probably already said more than she planned to today. But there is one last thing I want to ask. The coronation is a little over two months away, so how significant does she think 6 May will be in terms of breathing fresh life into the institution she venerates? 'I think it'll be an extraordinary moment,' she says. 'And I feel really strongly that the King is brilliant. He upholds everything that is good. I mean, what he's done for the environment! What he's done in his life! How he loves to paint, how he loves to walk, how he loves to be. 'He is a very special person. So for him to have a moment where everybody looks up and understands how hard he and the Royal family has worked, is important.' It should, Sarah believes, 'be a moment when the entire world will say, right: we've got this. And now we'll unite again and go on again. We are not?' she laughs, corrects herself, they are not celebrities. They are part of an extraordinary institution, and they go out and do their work. That's what I did when became a princess. 'Whatever happened, happened. We don't go back. But whether I'm or out, I'll always uphold it.'

Nataliia Zavalniuk, 39, and daughter Viktoriia, 14, had settled in Bosham, West Sussex, but returned to Vinnytsia in central Ukraine, in part because Viktoriia struggled to find orthodontic care. They had tried several dentists in Britain but were unable to find a clinic to take them on. Viktoriia had braces fitted soon after returning to Ukraine. The Times Health Commission has reported on research that found dentistry was more accessible in the wartorn country than in Britain. A health index by Economist Impact, which examined provision in 40 countries, found that 67 per cent of Ukrainians could see a dentist within 24 hours, compared with 23 per cent of people in Britain. The Times revealed recently that NHS dentists would be given bonuses for taking on extra patients in regions where practitioners were scarce. The research found that Britain was one of the worst countries for dental care, beating only France in the rankings. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the Zavalniuks moved in with Dr Louise Baverstock, a GP, who said that at first the mother and daughter did not have a bad word to say about the UK. ""I was so proud of being British to be honest and the social services were great,"" she added. ""After six months they moved into a flat and literally everything was perfect … but they couldn't get a dentist. ""Viktoriia clearly needed orthodontic treatment. And I thought, 'We're never going to get that in this country.' It's just not available for anybody. They went back to Ukraine on April 16."" Zavalniuk, a supply manager, is living with her daughter in Vinnytsia. She told The Times that her experience in the UK ""was very poor"", adding: ""I couldn't get an appointment for the dentist. ""I knew that it would be much more expensive [to go private]. It wasn't the main part of our decision but one of our small bits. Here in Ukraine, despite the war, it was easy."" Zavalniuk said that Viktoriia was fitted with braces for about £300 after ""just a couple of days"". Their former host in Bosham said that she regularly saw patients in her surgery who needed urgent care but were unable to get treatment. ""Everything in the NHS is much worse since the austerity measures came into place,"" Baverstock said. ""The people who can't access dentistry are vulnerable. I had a 30-year-old man at my previous practice who had no teeth. I'm really upset that I live in a country where we allow that."" Eddie Crouch, chairman of the British Dental Association, said that care for millions in Britain had ""effectively ceased"". He added: ""It speaks volumes that refugees are heading back to the front line. The government's cackhanded policies have failed Ukrainian guests and natives alike."" Richard Howe, 58, from Cambridgeshire, who lived in Kyiv before the war, said he returned when he developed an abscess this year. ""I was in loads of pain,"" he said. ""I was told there was no chance of me getting an appointment with the NHS. So I got one in Ukraine, straight away, for a fraction of the cost."" The Department for Health and Social Services has announced that dentists will get up to £50 for each new patient. The new policy to cover any patient who has not seen an NHS dentist for two years will be in place from today. Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, said she wanted to make access to dentistry ""faster, simpler and fairer"". The scheme is part of a £200 million plan to deliver an additional 2.5 million dental appointments over the next 12 months.

Some of the buildings he is proposing to target are grade I listed; many others have rare and precious contents. The devastating fires and careless treatment of British country houses that followed their being requisitioned in the 1940s by the government for temporary occupancy show the risks of this approach. Anyone who has let their property to even the best-behaved of short-term tenants knows about the breakages and destruction that can ensue.  Gove's threat to grade I buildings typifies our government of chancers who never look beyond the next day's headlines. Richard Davenport-Hines Ailhon, France Sir, My wife and I hope to offer a room in due course (""Tens of thousands of refugees to be welcomed into British homes"", Mar 14) but why should we be given £350 a month in return? We do not want rent, and if refugees receive benefits they can contribute to the cost of food. Similarly, why does a local authority need to be paid £10,000 for each refugee settled in their area? I wonder if these figures help to explain why Britain has seemed so reluctant to offer asylum to Ukrainians. Ken Dickinson Sicklinghall, N Yorks Sir, Samantha Bishop says that most village halls are empty for most of the year and could be used to house refugees (letter, Mar 12). Checking the diary, we could offer a couple of hours on Tuesday afternoons and alternate Friday mornings. There are possibly spaces in the dance, painting and badminton groups, the WI welcomes interesting speakers, the Scouts groups always need helpers, Maisie's parents could use another pair of hands at her birthday party but Lunch Club is full. However, Ms Bishop will be pleased to know that, like other caring village communities, we are finding our own practical ways of helping in the Ukrainian crisis. Janet Harrison Chairwoman, Hambledon Village Hall, Hants Sir, Clare Foges is right (""Staying neutral on Ukraine must come at a cost"", Mar 14). All the government need do is politely inform the government of Pakistan and others of like mind that UK foreign aid has had to be sharply reduced to free resources for the massive reconstruction that will be needed once the attempted colonial reconquest of independent Ukraine by a former imperial power has been defeated. I am sure they will get the message. Christopher Clapham Mepal, Cambs Sir, It is all very well for those such as John Porter (letter, Mar 14) to urge that there be a negotiated settlement between Ukraine and Russia, but what settlement could there possibly be? Putin has chosen to invade Ukraine with the intention of conquering it, and will settle for no less. The Ukrainians want their country back and see no reason why they should settle for less either. There is no remotely conceivable basis for any kind of partition of Ukraine. Either Putin will win or he will not; the only question is how long either of those possibilities will take to happen, and how much suffering there will be as a result.

3752,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,12/3/2022,514 words,NA,Willing and waiting to help Ukrainian refugees; Letters to the Editor,"Sir, After the horror of the world wars, the last time there was a huge movement of refugees in Europe, Britain was one of the founding signatories of the UN Convention on Refugees, in 1951. Seven decades on, as more than two million Ukrainians flee for their lives, the convention is more important than ever. But our government is dragging its feet, arguing and trying to use a visa scheme to respond to a humanitarian crisis (""Scheme to welcome refugees into British homes hit by delays"", Mar 11). Worse still, its Borders Bill seeks to entirely undermine the convention by criminalising refugees. The government should be waiving visa requirements, granting all Ukrainians who want to come immediate refugee status, and putting in place support to help them stabilise their lives. The public is waiting to help and many have offered accommodation. The government looks mean-spirited and cold-hearted. More than ever, now is the time to strengthen our commitment to the convention, not turn our back on it. Enver Solomon CEO, Refugee Council Lord Dubs Patron, Refugee Council Sir, The threat of being taken to a war crimes court will have little effect on Putin, but his generals and commanders are a different matter. More than anyone, they know what is happening in Ukraine. They take orders from the top but they give them too, and are responsible for the deaths of women and children. By publishing their names and ranks, the West would leave these commanders in no doubt that they will be held responsible. Perhaps then they might question their master's motives, and the propaganda being circulated to the Russian people. Michael Sunderland Twickenham Sir, On Christmas Eve in 1940, my grandmother's neighbour, Mrs Davies, was doing some last-minute shopping on Dudley High Street. As she left Woolworths, she was stopped by a young woman with two very small children. The young woman had just arrived from London and was looking for the evacuation office. At 4.30pm on Christmas Eve, Mrs Davies knew no one would be there. ""You'd better come with me,"" she said, and she took the family home. In the end, they stayed for the duration. It was an extraordinary act of generosity, particularly given that Mrs Davies lived on one of the poorest council estates in the Midlands, where nobody had any spare anything, and it forged friendships that lasted lifetimes. Fiona Awang Lindfield, West Sussex Sir, As the world adapts to the crisis in Ukraine, the UK could consider making use of its 10,000-plus village halls to provide accommodation to Ukrainian refugees desperately in need of shelter and safety. Most village halls have kitchens and bathrooms, and are empty for most of the year. In addition to shelter, halls would also provide an instant community for a family who has lost theirs. I doubt any village would begrudge such an offer. Samantha Bishop London SW11 Sir, Foreign aid is often portrayed as soft power rather than doing the right thing for humanity. If this is so, we should be cutting aid to all those who support the Russian invasion. David Simpson Darby Green, Herts",Broadsheet,1
3781,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,9/5/2023,462 words,Oliver Moody Berlin,Pro-Kremlin emlin MP aims to seize power in Slovakia,"Slovakia, an important hub for shipping armaments into and out of Ukraine, has fallen into political crisis after its pro-western government collapsed, leaving a Kremlin-friendly rival in pole position to take over. Under the leadership of Eduard Heger, a centre-right former Catholic community organiser, the central European state had embraced Kyiv's cause, taking in about 115,000 Ukrainian refugees. It has given dozens of its Soviet-era weapons systems, including an S-300 air defence battery, 30 BMP-1 fighting vehicles and its entire fleet of MiG-29 fighter jets, as well as pledging all 30 of its T-72 main battle tanks. The country has quietly become a conduit for supplies of arms from other western countries, including a consignment of AS90 self-propelled howitzers from the UK. It also hosts a repair depot for fixing German-made artillery and armoured vehicles. Since September it has hosted a Czech-led multinational Nato battlegroup, with a strength fluctuating between 650 and 1,000 soldiers. Yet Slovakia's future is now on the line, with Robert Fico, a veteran pro- Russian figure who has likened German Nato troops to Nazis and promised to cut off the flow of munitions to Ukraine through the country, well placed to win a third term in office. Fico, 58, was forced out of power in 2018 by a wave of protests following the killing of Jan Kuciak, a journalist who had been investigating sleazy financial dealings in the ruling party and the Slovakian business elite. Slovakia took a more liberal turn, electing Zuzana Caputova, an anticorruption lawyer, as its president in 2019 and voting in an eclectic coalition of parties the year after that. This new ruling alliance proved to be fractious and unstable. Igor Matovic, its first prime minister, lasted 12 months. Heger, 47, took the helm but struggled to get a grip on inflation, which at time has been above 15 per cent. He lost a confidence vote in December but stayed on as a caretaker charged with steering the country through to a general election in September. Even this proved too difficult. Heger resigned at the weekend after being publicly criticised by his foreign minister. He said the country was in a ""serious crisis, a crisis of chaos"". For the time being Caputova has appointed Ludovit Odor, a deputy governor of the central bank, to lead a stopgap technocratic administration. Polls suggest Fico's centre-left party, Smer, is on course to finish in first place. Fico has tried to harness public opinion against Ukraine. The Eurobarometer poll results, released by the EU in March, found that 44 per cent of Slovaks believed Ukrainian refugees were making their country a worse place. There has also been evidence to suggest a significant minority of the population would like Russia to win the war.",Broadsheet,0
3783,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,15/3/2022,701 words,Matt Dathan; Ben Webster,Light vetting will boost number of Ukrainians housed in Britain,"Households offering their homes to Ukrainians will face only ""light-touch"" vetting to maximise the number of refugees who come to the UK. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said that full DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks would not be needed for thousands of people signing up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Individuals and organisations who register to sponsor refugees will be checked against the Police National Computer to protect refugees from exploitative individuals taking advantage of the scheme. There was confusion after Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told Times Radio earlier yesterday that hosts would have ""DBS-style checks"". MPs warned that the lack of a full DBS check on individuals raised serious safeguarding concerns, given the government was suggesting that British households could use social media to match with Ukrainians. Hosts must match up with a Ukrainian refugee or family themselves before submitting a joint visa application with the named individuals. Although hosts could register their interest yesterday, visa applications for the scheme do not open until Friday. Gove said that local authorities, which will be given £10,500 per refugee resettled in their area, would be able to spot signs of abuse. Sponsors would be visited by safeguarding professionals from local government, but only after the Ukrainian refugees had moved in with their UK sponsor. With more than 35,000 households signing up in the first five hours of the scheme opening, there were concerns over how long and how thorough the checks would be. Government sources said that teachers, doctors and nurses would act as an ""additional check"" for problems such as domestic abuse. Announcing the scheme, Gove told MPs: ""We do not believe that we need to have full DBS checks to ensure that someone is an appropriate sponsor. Very light-touch criminal checks will often be sufficient, and then local authorities can be supported to ensure that people are safe."" Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced yesterday that he would offer to accommodate a Ukraini- an refugee in his home. Gove's hopes of housing a refugee have been complicated because he lives in Carlton Gardens, a grace-and-favour residence, since separating from his wife, Sarah Vine, last year. Security concerns are preventing him from hosting refugees at the apartment. It is normally the foreign secretary's official London residence but Liz Truss offered it to him after he moved out of his family home. Aides said that he is more likely to use his constituency home in Surrey Heath to accommodate refugees. Priti Patel is unlikely to host refugees because of security concerns over living with a home secretary, while Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would not be taking any Ukrainian refugees in. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said that it was up to individual ministers whether they chose to give accommodation to a refugee. ""There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10,"" he said. ""Obviously it will come down to individual circumstances. This is a significant commitment."" Javid said that it would be difficult to ""offer the time"" to host Ukrainian refugees in his home. He said it was important that those who offered to become a host could spend time with resettled families. Separately, the government announced emergency measures yesterday to allow all Ukrainian refugees to bring their pets into the UK. The government will cover the cost of any quarantine required. Animal welfare groups had warned that cats and dogs travelling with refugees might have to be euthanised unless the UK relaxed rules on pet travel. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We have put in place a new streamlined process for people bringing their pets from Ukraine. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will provide quick approvals and relevant quarantine arrangements, for which we will cover the costs."" An RSPCA spokeswoman said: ""We're pleased that for refugees coming to the UK they won't have the added heartbreak of leaving their pets behind.""

He urged the United Nations to broker a peace deal, and said that failing that the African Union or the League of Arab States should step in as an intermediary. Corbyn gave the interview to Al Mayadeen, a station in Beirut that is supportive of the Assad regime in Syria and the Hezbollah group in Lebanon. Al Mayadeen has toed the Kremlin line in its coverage of the conflict in Ukraine. A recent article entitled ""Lessons from Vietnam for Ukraine"" argued that the war had started because the US had installed a pro-western government in Kyiv. Ukrainian soldiers were ""cannon fodder"" in the pursuit of American geopolitical goals, it said. Corbyn said: ""Pouring arms in isn't going to bring about a solution, it's only going to prolong and exaggerate this war. We might be in for years and years of a war in Ukraine.

The British-Ukrainian Aid charity set out to raise £20,000 for medical supplies and first aid kits and had raised just under £90,000 by yesterday evening via its Just Giving page, which remains live. The Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain has an appeal that has reached £663,000 so far to support ""accredited and registered Ukrainian charities to provide medicines, food and critical services"". It has its own GoFundMe page. The Ukrainian Social Club in Holland Park, west London, has been accepting donations of clothes and medical supplies and called for volunteers to sort through and pack the items. A first consignment was due to leave London for Ukraine last night, carried by young men wanting to fight. Vladimir Siryy, 41, who works in the NHS's property department, was at Trafalgar Square yesterday at a protest against the invasion with his partner and two children, aged 9 and 7. He said that about 20 men in their twenties from the Holland Park club intended to take up arms. His family are in the western part of Ukraine, which has not yet been reached by Russian ground troops. ""It's a disaster,"" he said. ""We need the world to support our country.""

As with many things that involve the prime minister or one of his cabinet, there is tough rhetoric and big promises but little action. How is it that Roman Abramovich is allowed time to sell a football club and London property before sanctions occur? The Times is correct in noting that all of this is an international embarrassment. My American friends are astonished that the party of Churchill receives millions of pounds from Russian friends. It has always been a longstanding view in the US that the Labour Party was the ally of Russia. How times have changed. Chris Kessell New York Sir, The situation in Ukraine is dire yet the prime minister continues to show his typical disjunct between words and actions. While eastern Europe and Germany are doing a sterling job catering for more than a million Ukrainian refugees, and France has already cordoned off expensive properties owned by Russian oligarchs and frozen other of their assets including luxury yachts, Britain has grudgingly signalled the acceptance of a limited number of Ukrainian refugees with strings attached and has yet to enforce any sanctions on its erstwhile oligarch friends, claiming that they have good lawyers. Instead Boris Johnson seems happy to race around Europe offering fine words and photo opportunities, and boasting of Britain's help for Ukraine. Someone ought to tell the prime minister that Ukraine is a real crisis, not simply another component of Operation Save Big Dog. Gray Lane ArgelÈs-sur-Mer, France Sir, Gerard Baker (""Path to war was paved with Biden's failures"", comment, Mar 4) is right to point to the West's naivety over a number of decades. We have spent the peace dividend many times over while ignoring aggression from Putin, who signalled his ruthlessness in 2006 when Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium within a mile of Buckingham Palace; our reaction to this was pusillanimous. Putin has sensed our weakness, both in the western alliance and in the UK. We must now rearm, as indeed Germany has finally understood. Lord Robathan Armed forces minister 2012-13; House of Lords Sir, It is all very well for James Forsyth to advocate a significant increase in defence spending (""Defence boost will force us to cut elsewhere"", Mar 4) but the Ministry of Defence is hardly a byword for sound fiscal management. Indeed, the public accounts committee (PAC) criticised the MoD last year for wasting billions of pounds of taxpayers' money, having ""overseen many expensive failures"". The PAC described the department's recent procurement record as ""literally scandalous"". If we cannot expect sound financial management from the department responsible for national defence it does not bode well for our long-term security. Brendan Griggs Cambridge",Broadsheet,0
3823,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,15/3/2022,1155 words,Matt Dathan; Ben Webster,Light vetting will boost number er of Ukrainians housed in Britain,"Households offering their homes to Ukrainians will face only ""light-touch"" vetting to maximise the number of refugees who come to the UK. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said that full DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks would not be needed for thousands of people signing up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Individuals and organisations who register to sponsor refugees will be checked against the Police National Computer to protect refugees from exploitative individuals taking advantage of the scheme. There was confusion after Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told Times Radio earlier yesterday that hosts would have ""DBS-style checks"". MPs warned that the lack of a full DBS check on individuals raised serious safeguarding concerns, given the government was suggesting that British households could use social media to match with Ukrainians. Hosts must match up with a Ukrainian refugee or family themselves before submitting a joint visa application with the named individuals. Although hosts could register their interest yesterday, visa applications for the scheme do not open until Friday. Gove said that local authorities, which will be given £10,500 per refugee resettled in their area, would be able to spot signs of abuse. Sponsors would be visited by safeguarding professionals from local government, but only after the Ukrainian refugees had moved in with their UK sponsor. With more than 35,000 households signing up in the first five hours of the scheme opening, there were concerns over how long and how thorough the checks would be. Government sources said that teachers, doctors and nurses would act as an ""additional check"" for problems such as domestic abuse. Announcing the scheme, Gove told MPs: ""We do not believe that we need to have full DBS checks to ensure that someone is an appropriate sponsor. Very light-touch criminal checks will often be sufficient, and then local authorities can be supported to ensure that people are safe."" Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced yesterday that he would offer to accommodate a Ukraini- an refugee in his home. Gove's hopes of housing a refugee have been complicated because he lives in Carlton Gardens, a grace-and-favour residence, since separating from his wife, Sarah Vine, last year. Security concerns are preventing him from hosting refugees at the apartment. It is normally the foreign secretary's official London residence but Liz Truss offered it to him after he moved out of his family home. Aides said that he is more likely to use his constituency home in Surrey Heath to accommodate refugees. Priti Patel is unlikely to host refugees because of security concerns over living with a home secretary, while Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would not be taking any Ukrainian refugees in. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said that it was up to individual ministers whether they chose to give accommodation to a refugee. ""There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10,"" he said. ""Obviously it will come down to individual circumstances. This is a significant commitment."" Javid said that it would be difficult to ""offer the time"" to host Ukrainian refugees in his home. He said it was important that those who offered to become a host could spend time with resettled families. Separately, the government announced emergency measures yesterday to allow all Ukrainian refugees to bring their pets into the UK. The government will cover the cost of any quarantine required. Animal welfare groups had warned that cats and dogs travelling with refugees might have to be euthanised unless the UK relaxed rules on pet travel. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We have put in place a new streamlined process for people bringing their pets from Ukraine. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will provide quick approvals and relevant quarantine arrangements, for which we will cover the costs."" An RSPCA spokeswoman said: ""We're pleased that for refugees coming to the UK they won't have the added heartbreak of leaving their pets behind."" Letters, page 24 Scheme will work only if charities are in driving seat, leading article, page 25 Q&A What is the new scheme announced yesterday? Homes for Ukraine allows individuals, businesses, charities and community groups to bring people escaping the war to safety even if they have no ties to the UK. Who can sign up? Anyone with a room or home available can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family as long as they can commit to at least six months. Does the host have to be living in the property? No. Will hosts be vetted? Yes, but only ""very light-touch"" checks will be carried out as the government wants to get as many refugees matched as soon as possible. Hosts will be checked against the police national computer to detect exploitative individuals. Will hosts' homes be checked? Yes, sponsors will be visited by safeguarding professionals from the local authority to assess whether the property and individuals are appropriate after those who have moved in. How do hosts sign up? By filling out a form at www.homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk. Hosts are asked whether they can offer sixnine months, 10-12 months, or more than 12 months. They can sign up to accommodate a single adult, multiple adults or families and can also offer a number of properties. What happens next? After hosts have passed basic security checks, they must name an individual or family they wish to accommodate in a separate visa application form that they can fill in from Friday. How do hosts and refugees get matched? UK hosts are responsible for finding the Ukrainians and must name individuals or families they want to bring to the UK. This will rely on UK hosts having connections, or finding refugees through social networks on or offline. Organisations such as the Sanctuary Foundation have set up a consortium of bodies that will help match hosts with refugees. What if hosts cannot find a refugee to sponsor? They will have to wait until the second phase of the scheme is launched within the next few weeks. They can register their interest on the same form as above. How long can refugees stay? Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years' leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services. What checks will be carried out on Ukrainians? Those with Ukrainian passports will be allowed to apply online and travel to the UK without attending a visa centre but must submit their biometric details at a centre in the UK within six months of arriving. Is there any compensation? Those offering a place to stay will receive an optional tax-free monthly payment of £350 which will not affect benefit entitlements or council tax status. Councils will be entitled to £10,500 per Ukrainian refugee. Hosts must not charge any rent. How many have applied? There were over 44,000 offers in the first six hours.

Susan Aitken, the council leader, said the authority would not accept pleas from Westminster to moor floating accommodation in the city. The first asylum seekers boarded the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset this week, despite claims that the plans are cruel and inhuman and the Fire Brigades Union calling it a potential death trap. Glasgow council said it ""was made aware that agents working on behalf of the Home Office were exploring a potential site for a barge within Glasgow"". It has ""made it clear to the Home Office that it does not support such a move"". The UK government has found it hard to get locations for the ships, which aim to cut the costs of housing asylum seekers currently lodged in hotels. Aitken's post on social media was shared by Humza Yousaf. She said: ""The UK government wants Glasgow city council to give consent to an asylum seeker barge being sited in the city. We will not give it. ""Glasgow's communities are proud to be beacons of support and integration for asylum seekers and refugees. This is the polar opposite of that."" The Scottish government said the ""vessels are not suitable accommodation for people seeking asylum"" and locating one in Scotland must be accompanied by funding and public services for the local community. Edinburgh rebuffed a similar request in June. Cammy Day, the council leader, said in a letter to the Home Office that he was concerned that the cruise ship Victoria, which housed Ukrainian refugees in Leith, could become a ""floating prison"". The Scottish Refugee Council said that it welcomed the decision by Glasgow council as the barges were ""wholly inappropriate accommodation"". About 170 asylum seekers are housed in the Muthu Glasgow River Hotel in Erskine, 15 miles from Glasgow. Hundreds of people have protested outside, including pro-refugee campaigners, far-right groups and locals concerned over the effect on stretched services. The Scottish government said: ""If the UK government chooses to impose the use of vessels to accommodate people anywhere in Scotland, we have said it must be accompanied by suitable funding for the council and public services such as health so that people can be welcomed and supported appropriately.""",Broadsheet,1

Hosting today's summit of European leaders is arguably Moldova's biggest moment for a century, and certainly since it became independent as Soviet Russia fell apart in 1991. ""It is the biggest event since independence,"" Nicu Popescu, the Moldovan foreign minister, said. ""Moldova is not alone. We are a country that is in a dangerous place at a dangerous time in the history of our European continent."" When Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine last year there were early fears that Moscow's troops would sweep through Odesa to take Moldova. Then as the threat of direct invasion receded with Ukrainian resistance, Moldova's population of only three million has faced energy and economic crises, Moscow-backed coup attempts, political destabilisation and constant cyberattacks. On top of all that, since a violent conflict in 1992 Moldova's Transnistria territory has been a breakaway separatist statelet backed by Moscow, occupied by Russian military forces, that was further destabilised by the invasion of Ukraine. Moldova is on the front line and the key battlefield in the new geopolitics. There were concerns four years ago that the country, one of the most obscure backwaters of the post-Soviet landscape, was slipping into corrupt authoritarianism and rule by oligarchs with close ties to Russia. Today Moldova is the centre of attention after rising to Putin's challenges under the leadership of President Sandu, the ""iron lady"". By invading Ukraine and threatening Moldova, Putin has miscalculated as, certainly in the opening months of the war, Moldovans mobilised to help their neighbours and popular sentiment has turned to Europe and away from Russia. ""Everybody chipped in, everybody mobilised, so we really earned this attention,"" Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's economy minister, said. Since the war in Ukraine, 720,000 refugees have passed through Moldova after being sheltered and looked after. About 107,000 Ukrainian refugees remain, with 80 per cent hosted in Moldovan private homes. To put this in perspective, it is the equivalent of Britain helping 17 million refugees from mainland Europe at a time of war and hosting 2.6 million in private homes.",Broadsheet,0

3862,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,17/5/2024,730 words,Roger Boyes,Putin revels in spectre of a fractured Europe; Analysis,"With European parliament elections only weeks away, the continent has rarely been so anxious about the future (Roger Boyes writes). The assassination attempt on Robert Fico, the Slovakian leader, could lead towards a kind of civil war, according to the country's interior minister, throwing fuel on a society already polarised by the Ukrainian conflict on its borders. At the heart of this tension creeping across eastern Europe is the question of where a violently disruptive Russia fits into the security architecture of the continent. Does the very idea of Europe - once a beacon of hope for post-communist states - have to be defined in opposition to President Putin's territorial ambitions? Or is there, as some populists such as Fico and Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, believe, some kind of halfway house? After the break-up of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 and the fracturing of the Czechoslovak state, Slovakian leaders declared that their international role should be as a bridge between East and West. Austria (Vienna is a short drive from Bratislava) does much the same but from the perspective of a declared neutral state. Slovakia saw more long-term safety in Nato membership. And that's when its problems began. Bridges are the first things to be blown up when war breaks out. When Russia launched its allout invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Slovakia became a transit country for western weapons and a repair hub for smashed-up Nato kit. But the populists knew that there were few votes to be won in acting in solidarity with Nato and the EU. Farmers in Slovakia, as in Poland and Hungary, objected to the arrival of cheap competition from Ukrainian grain. As in much of the rest of Europe, Russia used its troll armies to sow doubts among electorates, churning out black propaganda against Ukrainian refugees, underlining Moscow's supposed desire for peace and warning against falling under America's spell. Fico was convinced. ""No one is going to attack anyone, there will be no war,"" he declared in early February 2022 despite the 150,000 troops massed on the Russian and Belarusian borders with Ukraine. As far as his party, Smer, was concerned, ""war in Ukraine is one gigantic hoax cooked up by Americans to drive a wedge between, and to frighten Europeans"". Fico has been saying something similar for decades. ""The world has four cardinal points,"" he said at the start of his political career.""Not just west, but also east, north and south."" Russia duly helped Fico to return to power in last September's elections. America hopes that new governments in Poland and the Czech Republic will bring Slovakia and Hungary back into the fold, to produce some kind of political unity at the Nato's 75th birthday summit in Washington in July. But the fact is that as long as Putin seems to be capturing ground and transforming the Russian economy into a giant weapons factory, those European governments on the fence are likely to stay there. In Georgia, the Georgian Dream party, backed by the Moscowlinked billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, has forced through a bill banning foreign NGOs. Its aim is to stifle western influence in the country and block any progress towards EU membership. This obstructionism merely highlights the choice that is on the table for many fragile democracies in Europe: alignment with EU institutions (who have been flagging interest in enlisting unstable new members) or a deeper dependence on Moscow. Russia presents the alternatives for east Europeans as being about national self-interest. Germany can afford to drastically cut back on Russian energy. Bulgaria, Hungary, Serbia, Moldova less so - even if Gazprom is no longer the strutting geopolitical influencer it once was. Choose the East, Russia says, the Kremlin is the winning team, backed by China and able to survive the most comprehensive financial blockade launched in modern days. The battle is on, even if the Fico attack does not easily fit into the Kremlin narrative (the assailant was allegedly a maverick writer associated with a nationalist pro-Russian group). The Moldovans are concerned that the Russians will mobilise the breakaway Transnistrian statelet and make EU accession impossible. The Russian interest in all of its endeavours, from cyberwar to influence operations, is in demonstrating that western promises of security are unreliable. In Putin's embrace they are safe.

The former prime minister's warning came as the UN said that half of the three million people who had fled Ukraine were minors. May demanded that the Home Office and National Crime Agency step up resources and equipment at the border to help identify children being trafficked. Many unaccompanied children would have fled Ukraine without documentation, leaving them vulnerable to criminal gangs that had begun targeting vulnerable women and children within a day of the first refugees crossing the Ukraine-Polish border, May told MPs yesterday. As of 9.15pm yesterday, 122,305 people and groups in the UK had signed up to give homes to Ukrainian refugees, just over 24 hours after the scheme was launched. From Friday, they will be able to name a Ukrainian refugee or family they want to bring to the UK. The Local Government Association said it expected the first Ukrainians to be with their UK host as early as Sunday. It called on the government to provide ""up-to-the minute data"" to ensure that councils can supply support as quickly and appropriately as possible and warned that local authorities faced a ""very tight timeframe"" to carry out safety checks on accommodation. James Jamieson, the Local Government Association chairman, urged the government to provide a back-up plan for refugees whose sponsored accommodation did not meet safety standards. ""Despite good intentions, there is a risk that some accommodation may not meet safety expectations when inspected by councils, or sponsorships may break down."" The expenses watchdog has cleared the way for MPs to use their taxpayerfunded homes to house refugees. Ipsa was forced to issue a statement insisting there was ""nothing in our rules"" preventing MPs from using their homes to house refugees, after government whips told MPs they were barred from participating in the scheme. A streamlined application process came into effect yesterday to allow refugees in possession of a Ukrainian passport to apply for a visa online. Some applications were being processed and approved by Home Office officials within ten minutes, a source in the department told The Times. The number of visas issued to Ukrainian refugees would rapidly increase as a result, the source said. More that 4,600 visas had been granted under the Ukraine family visa scheme despite 33,000 applications being submitted by Monday evening, representing the first ten days of the scheme. Refugees who fled without a passport must book an appointment at a visa centre to qualify for Britain's Ukraine visa schemes. May told the Commons that criminal gangs had exploited the ""chaotic"" scenes at Polish towns close to the Ukrainian border within a day of Russia's invasion on February 24. She said that she had been working closely with anti-trafficking organisations such as Walk Free and the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery in the region trying to track children at risk. ""It's a sad reflection on human nature that the very point that these women and children are fleeing to find refuge, the criminal gangs have moved in to make money from the trafficking of what they consider to be another commodity that is human beings and they are attempting to make money out of this human distress and vulnerability."" The UN said three million refugees had fled Ukraine - half were children. About 1.8 million refugees had fled to Poland. On average, 70,000 children a day had become refugees since Russia invaded Ukraine. May said the National Crime Agency must treat trafficking concerns relating to the Ukraine crisis as a matter of urgency and must be equipped appropriately by the Home Office. ""I hope that the Home Office will be taking up this issue with the National Crime Agency to ensure they have the resources that they need to be able to deal with this issue and that the NCA and the Home Office recognise the urgency and importance of this issue with the trafficking with these children. ""Reducing the opportunities for the traffickers, catching the traffickers - identifying them and prosecuting them is the second point but we also need to recognise that some children will be prey to the traffickers and some of them may be brought across borders here into the United Kingdom. It is possible to identify children who are being trafficked when they are being brought through the border."" She added: ""My third ask to the Home Office is that it ensure that the Border force recognise the possibility of trafficked Ukrainian children being brought into the country, reinforce its guidelines to Border Force staff on how to identify them and ensure that they are being aware of this potential issue and being vigilant in dealing with it.""

A government source insisted: ""It's not the government's fault if they don't want to come."" Another source working on the Homes for Ukraine scheme said: ""It seems as though some people who have applied for visas are holding back from actually coming to the UK to see what happens in the next couple of weeks. ""If we're granting 5,000 visas but only a tenth of those have actually come, then the only conclusion we can draw from it is they are waiting to see what happens in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities before they make the move.

Anna, a 32-year-old woman, has been waiting for a UK visa in a basement with five others in the Donbas region with no water or lavatories. Qureshi said: ""We advised her to attempt to reach the border and have arranged a flight to Ireland, which is visa-free. If her UK visa comes through then she can travel on. But why did she wait?

The suspected agent, who worked at the Foreign Office and had access top secret documents, was told in 2019 that his British citizenship was being removed because of spying claims and that he was considered a security risk. However, in a move that raises questions about border security and checks in Kabul, he was allowed on to one of the last flights to Britain during the evacuation after the Taliban takeover in 2021, a court was told. He was arrested on arrival in the UK. Before his return, the security services had assessed that should he re-enter Britain, ""there was a real risk he would undertake activity on behalf of the GRU [Russian military intelligence]"". This week The Times revealed that the suspected Russian agent worked at the Foreign Office and met David Cameron, Prince William and the future King. The individual, who can be identified only as C2, is appealing against the decision to strip him of his citizenship in a hearing before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. He denies posing a threat to national security or working as an agent. The revelation that a suspected spy was granted a place on an evacuation flight will be particularly embarrassing for the government, which has been criticised for leaving interpreters and others who worked with British forces in Afghanistan behind. The Home Office declined to comment on how C2 was able to re-enter Britain, saying that it could not comment on a live case. C2, who was born in Afghanistan and Continued on page 2 continued from page 1 'Putin spy in MI6' on Kabul flight entered the UK as an Afghan refugee in 2000, admits giving false information to secure asylum. He had in fact been living in Russia, with a Russian wife. He became an interpreter and worked his way up to the Foreign Office. He told the court that he had also worked for GCHQ, MI6 and the Ministry of Defence. In 2019, when he was working in the public sector in Afghanistan, he was interviewed by MI5 while visiting London and accused of working for the GRU. He was stripped of his citizenship that year. The government's submissions to the court say: ""The essential reasoning was that the security service assessed that the appellant was an agent of the Russian military intelligence services (GRU) and that, should he return to the UK, there was a real risk he would undertake activity on behalf of the GRU and that he therefore posed a risk to UK national security."" Following the Salisbury poisonings in 2018, the security services were seeking to prevent Russian intelligence from rebuilding its presence in the UK, the document continues. Later that year C2 filed an appeal against the decision to deprive him of British citizenship, and remained living in Kabul. However, when Kabul fell in August 2021, he was evacuated as part of Operation Pitting, in which 15,000 people considered to be at risk from the Taliban were flown to the UK. His barrister said he had been evacuated because the British authorities ""recognised that owing to his previous activities on behalf of the UK he would be at risk from the Taliban"". The government neither confirms nor denies that he returned during Operation Pitting, but says it is ""irrelevant"" to the case against him. On Tuesday a court was told that C2 was detained in Belmarsh Prison on his return to Britain, for reasons of national security. Shortly afterwards, the reasons for his detention were changed to ""deception"" and ""unacceptable conduct"", and he was released on bail. He remains in the UK. His barrister suggested in court that he was no longer considered to be a GRU agent. The hearing continues. Politicians have previously raised concerns about hostile states abusing the asylum system.

The video shows marble-clad bathrooms, eight bedrooms, a music room with a piano and guitars, a gaudy bar, a library and a terrace overlooking the sea. ""We dedicate this action to Ukraine. The oligarchic regime of Vladimir Putin and his accomplices have leaked hundreds of billions of euros from Russia and Ukraine over the past 20 years,"" Haffner said. He wrote on Facebook: ""Instead of a luxurious retreat for the oligarchs Putin-Shamalov, we decided to organise a place here for rehabilitation and life for the victims of the Putin regime, especially refugees from Ukraine and Russia who have been forced to flee war, repression and torture prisons."" The police arrested Haffner yesterday on suspicion of breaking and enter- ing after news of his group's act was circulated on Ukrainian and Russian social media.

When the Russian invasion began, the Ocheretny villa was daubed with obscene anti-Putin slogans in Ukraine's yellow and blue colours. Putin still owns a villa in Biarritz, which he bought in 1996 when he was a civil servant in St Petersburg, the French security service told Europe 1 radio. He put the house in the name of one of his daughters after acquiring it for $400,000 when he was earning less than $1,000 a month.

The prime minister vowed to expand visa schemes for entrepreneurs and ""highly skilled people"" as part of a plan for Britain to be a ""beacon for the world's best and brightest"". However, he insisted the ""No 1 priority"" on immigration must be tackling illegal migration to ensure the public have ""trust and confidence that the system works and is fair"". Today Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will send a similar message to business leaders, telling them that the economy must end its ""immigration dependency"". Setting out more details of Labour's immigration policy in an address to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference in Birmingham, he will say that any expansion in visa schemes will come with ""new conditions for business"". He will reiterate Labour's support for a points-based immigration system and try to put clear blue water between his leadership and the party's previous support for freedom of movement. A Labour government will be ""pragmatic"" in dealing with shortages in the labour market, Starmer will say, citing the shortage of lorry drivers last year that led to big gaps in supplies. This means Labour will not ignore the need for skilled people to come to the UK, he will tell business chiefs. However, in return for any expansion in visa schemes, businesses will have to produce plans for improving the skills and training of the domestic workforce and spend more on new technology to ensure they wean themselves off their reliance on migrants to fill vacancies. Starmer will say: ""Migration is part of our national story - always has been, always will be. And the Labour Party will never diminish the contribution it makes to the economy or our communities. But the days when low pay and cheap labour are part of the British way on growth must end."" The speech will begin to flesh out what Labour's immigration policy will look like at the next election, including an overhaul of the migration advisory committee, the government's independent immigration advisers, to ensure it has better information, connects across government departments on labour and skills shortages and projects trends. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, has called for a new deal on immigration, telling the government that business ""don't have the people we need"" and it was ""unrealistic"" to think labour shortages could be solved by automation. He called for fixed-term visas to fill labour shortages and urged the government to be ""practical"" about immigration. The latest quarterly immigration statistics will be published on Thursday and are expected to show increasing numbers have come to the UK. However, analysis by the Migration Observatory at Oxford University has found that net migration is likely to fall over the coming months because the main driver of immigration over the past two years has been the humanitarian visa schemes for Hong Kong exiles and Ukrainian refugees. A poll by Ipsos yesterday suggested confidence in the home secretary was at rock bottom, with half thinking Suella Braverman is doing a bad job on immigration.

The Times has been told that ministers have procured an ""accommodation barge"" capable of holding hundreds of migrants, which is being refitted. They have yet to decide where it will be based, although it will be located at a port rather than at sea. A government source said the barge would have a ""deterrent effect"" on people crossing the Channel illegally. They added, however, that discussions about using it were at an early stage and acknowledged there were significant practical problems. The barge is of a kind more typically used for offshore construction projects and has basic facilities. It is unclear how the government would deal with matters such as the safety of those on board, although a government source said: ""It's a row we're prepared to have."" Robert Jenrick, the migration minister, is expected to confirm plans to transfer about 3,000 migrants from hotels to two RAF bases. He is expected to announce that the Home Office has acquired the use of RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire ? the base from which the Dambusters flew ? and MDP Wethersfield in Essex from the Ministry of Defence. Local councils have threatened legal action against the proposals and James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has voiced his opposition against the use of MDP Wethersfield in his capacity as the area's MP. Jenrick will give an update on progress towards Rishi Sunak's pledge, made in December, to end the use of hotels to accommodate migrants, and his ambitious goal to clear a backlog of asylum cases by the end of the year. More than 51,000 asylum seekers are being housed in about 400 hotels, costing taxpayers nearly £7 million a day. A report by the foreign aid watchdog, to be published today, will condemn the government for wasting a third of its overseas aid budget on accommodating asylum seekers in hotels. The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), which examines the Continued on page 4 Continued from page 1 value and quality of foreign aid spending, found that £3.5 billion was spent on asylum accommodation costs last year, which it described as ""poor value for money"". This cost has tripled in a year. The plan was revealed as Sunak told MPs yesterday that the government had no choice but to detain migrant children, to deter people from taking their families on the ""perilous journey"" to Britain. Under the illegal migration bill, children arriving in the UK will be treated in the same way as other asylum seekers and held in detention until they can be deported to Rwanda. Speaking to the Commons liaison committee, the prime minister insisted that the ""objective"" of the policy was not to detain children but he had no choice but to include them to prevent the creation of a ""pull factor"". He also played down expectations of deportation flights to Rwanda starting this summer, contradicting Suella Braverman, the home secretary. More than 160,000 asylum seekers are waiting for their claim to be processed. About 92,000 of these relate to claims lodged by June last year, which Sunak has pledged to clear by the end of the year.

The government has lagged behind the EU in imposing sanctions on wealthy Russians, leading to tensions between ministers and officials. An amendment to the Economic Crime Bill next week will enable the UK to ""mirror"" sanctions imposed by the EU and the US. The government will also use the legislation to limit human rights protections for oligarchs facing sanctions in response to concerns that the current legal system is ""gold-plated"". During the passage of the sanctions bill in 2017 the government made significant concessions in the Lords after amendments tabled by Lord Pannick QC, a prominent lawyer, and Lord Judge, a former lord chief justice. The UK's post-Brexit sanctions regime requires the government to consider whether the ""significant effect"" of sanctions on individuals is ""appropriate"", a direct reference to the European Convention on Human Rights. The government will remove this test as it seeks to streamline the process. Another amendment will make it easier to sanction large groups of individuals by relaxing requirements for detailing the reasons for action. Foreign Office lawyers conceded that it could take ""weeks and months"" to sanction Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, and sanctioned 25 oligarchs and individuals linked to President Putin, including several with significant assets in Britain. The UK has sanctioned 15. Johnson is pushing for more action on sanctioning banks and in barring more Russian entities from using Swift, the international payments platform. ""There is plainly more to be done with sanctioning some banks, with tightening Swift, with coming down harder on some individuals, and we want to make sure that we graduate and we intensify,"" he said in an interview with Repubblica and Die Welt. ""It feels to me as though Vladimir Putin has decided to double down. He sees no way out of the cul-de-sac that he's in, except to continue with the destruction, the pulverising of innocent populations in innocent European cities. So we have to respond together with an intensified package."" Johnson said that the government would face a ""brick wall of lawyers"" if it failed to build a case against Abramovich. ""None of us want to live in a country where the state can take your house off you without a very high burden of proof and due process,"" he said. ""There's no point saying, 'Yeah, we're going to go after him', and then you come up against the brick wall of lawyers. So we have to get it right."" Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, told LBC that the government could seize mansions from oligarchs in London and use them to house Ukrainian refugees.

Ian Blackford said the shortterm focus of all politicians should be on the crisis in Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. He cautioned those wanting immediate progress on a second constitutional vote to be ""mindful of where we are"" given events elsewhere in the world. Asked about another referendum, Blackford took a long pause before saying: ""We have got to be respectful of the situation that we are in."" He said: ""We have got to be respectful of the responsibilities that we have in the short term, but I'm also respectful to the principle that we have a mandate for an independence referendum. ""I want that referendum to take place in a timely manner. I want us to be able to execute the mandate that we have."" Blackford added, however: ""We have to play the ball where it lies just now and the only thing that I'm focusing on today is Ukraine."" Several SNP parliamentarians at Holyrood and Westminster privately admit that they do not believe another referendum will place on Nicola Sturgeon's timetable and that another general election would probably be needed to break the impasse. Angus MacNeil, the SNP MP and chairman of the international trade committee, last night became the first to publicly confirm his doubts. He said it was for the Scottish parliament to legislate for a referendum date and then see if it would survive a challenge in the courts. He argued that an independent Scotland would be able to do more to help Ukrainian refugees. ""My view, and I really hope I am wrong, is that there will not be a referendum in 2023,"" MacNeil said. ""As a result party membership will want to vote for a resolution to endorse the remaining bridge to independence [at the 2022 or 2023 conference] which is using elections for independence rather than elections for referendums that can't happen, due to a likely Supreme Court ruling."" In the interview, Blackford reiterated the SNP's commitment to removing Trident and suggested the UK's nuclear deterrent should be ditched because there was a ""threat to the world from nuclear weapons"". He rejected claims put forward by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, that an independent Scotland would be more vulnerable to terrorism threats and Russian aggression if it became independent. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 in exchange for guarantees from world powers including Russia not to violate its security. Svitlana Zalishchuk, a foreign policy adviser to the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, last week told Sky News ""this war wouldn't have started"" if the country had kept its arsenal. Blackford also said that the Queen would remain head of state in an independent Scotland. Donald Cameron, the Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman, said: ""In an increasingly uncertain world, the nationalists should not be considering constitutional upheaval by attempting to break Scotland away.""",Broadsheet,0

The government is expected to announce plans to use half a dozen holiday parks, which are anticipated to be available from January once talks about the length of leases have concluded. Ministers also want to expand the use of old university halls of residence to cut the need for hotels. One such site already housing migrants is the former Canterbury Christ Church University building in Broadstairs, Kent. Disused military bases similar to the RAF site at Manston, which was turned into a processing centre, are also being considered as a ""long-term"" solution. The government believes that using old student halls and empty holiday camps would be a ""win-win"" because they would be cheaper than hotels. Several local councils, including in Rishi Sunak's own constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire, have moved homeless people and Ukrainian refugees out of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The issue is also becoming politically toxic, with many Tory MPs objecting to the use of hotels in their areas. A government source said: ""Student accommodation and disused holiday camps are not going to attract the same kind of criticism."" Albanian people smugglers have urged migrants to pay for crossings this week due to ""calm"" conditions. One post on TikTok offered prices of (EURO)3,000 for a small boat crossing and promised a maximum of 27 people on board. In contrast, it said journeys in the back of a lorry would cost (EURO)20,000. More than 44,000 migrants have crossed the Channel this year and officials believe there are about 6,000 people who want to make the journey in the coming weeks, which could take this year's total to more than 50,000. At the weekend Lee Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, appeared to issue a veiled threat to quit the party if illegal immigration was not tackled. Writing in the Mail on Sunday he said: ""If this isn't solved within the first three months of 2023, we will struggle to retain the red wall and my conscience will be severely tested because I want to stand as a Conservative candidate representing a party that will put the interests of my constituents before the thousands of illegal immigrants arriving here every month."" David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, told Times Radio that the Tories would lose the next election if they failed to grip the issue. ""It won't matter whether Lee [Anderson] stands as a Tory or anything else, he won't get elected,"" he said. ""None of us will."" He said that Albania should be declared a ""safe country"" so claims could be fast-tracked. ""If they do that, it won't solve the whole problem,"" he said. ""But it will take a third of it out. And it means the rest becomes manageable."" During the Tory leadership campaign in the summer, Sunak pledged to ""deliver thousands of new beds through a range of existing and novel solutions, including the use of cruise ships"". A Home Office source said that while the idea of using cruise ships as accommodation was discussed in a recent meeting, they were less likely to be used than holiday parks and former student halls.

The National Security Council has held discussions about whether the government can do more with the personal wealth of sanctioned oligarchs. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is said to be an advocate of plans to seize their wealth and the Home Office is said to be considering legislation. The government wants to use the oligarchs' wealth, which is estimated at £10 billion, to fund a ""Marshall plan"" to rebuild Ukraine. There is an active discussion about whether the money could also go towards providing Ukraine with more weapons. The government wants to take a coordinated approach with other nations. Canada has announced plans to introduce laws to enable it to redistribute the wealth of oligarchs to victims of the war in Ukraine. Ministers in Britain have discussed whether existing sanctions legislation can be amended to enable the government to seize assets but there are concerns over legal action. Truss has pushed publicly for allies to draw up a ""new Marshall plan"", a reference to the American finance that helped to rebuild Europe after the Second World War, totalling more than $115 billion in today's money. In a speech in April she said: ""Ukraine deserves nothing less than a landmark international effort to rebuild their towns and cities, regenerate their industries, and secure their freedom for the long term."" A source close to her said Truss believed it was possible to deal with the legal risks. ""It is fiendishly difficult but Liz's view is that we have to leave no stone unturned. It has to be right that ill-gotten Russian cash in some way finances the rebuilding of Ukraine."" The UK has to date sanctioned more than 100 oligarchs and their family members over their links to President Putin's regime. They include Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea Football Club, Alisher Usmanov, who had links to Everton football club and Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia's wealthiest men. Under the sanctions, individuals have their assets frozen and are barred from travel to the UK. Truss has said the sanctions should never be lifted. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has previously pushed for the government to seize mansions belonging to oligarchs and use them to house Ukrainian refugees. Truss believes that the war in Ukraine could last for five years or even a decade, and fears that Putin could use weapons of mass destruction to break the deadlock. Last month Putin's exwife and family members were added to the UK's sanctions list. The former first lady, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, who divorced the president in 2014, was said to have benefited from ""preferential business relationships with state-owned entities"". Others sanctioned include Alexander Plekhov, described by the Foreign Office as a ""close friend"" of Putin.

Charles has also fulfilled the public promise his mother made to Prince Edward on his wedding day. The announcement followed Buckingham Palace's acknowledgement that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children are known as Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet and is seen in royal circles as evidence of the King not wishing to fight unnecessary battles. Edward's support for the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme - founded by their father and undertaken by about 330,000 people each year worldwide - helped persuade the king to confer the title. Charles, 74, inherited the dukedom on his father's death aged 99 in June 2021 and it reverted to the Crown when he became King in September last year. Although Edward was the only of the Queen's sons not to hold a dukedom the King is keen to slim down the royal family. With the Duke of York and Duke of Sussex no longer working royals, however, Edward has an increased public role. The dukedom was conferred on Edward's 59th birthday before a reception in Edinburgh to mark the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He was given the title Earl of Forfar by the Queen four years ago. Edward said he was ""slightly overwhelmed"" by the latest appointment as he told Ukrainian refugees: ""I hope you can all try to make Scotland and Britain your home for as long you feel that you need to stay here and we will try to make it as welcoming and as safe as possible for you."" His wife, Sophie, 58, becomes Duchess of Edinburgh. Their son, James, Viscount Severn, 15, has become Earl of Wessex and will become Earl of Forfar, but will not inherit the title of Duke of Edinburgh. Charles has ordered the Dukedom to revert to the Crown, so it will not ""leave"" the heart of the royal family when Edward dies. None of the changes affect the couple's eldest child, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor, 19. The late Queen gave Edward the earldom of Wessex, a title he chose, when he married Sophie Rhys-Jones in 1999. Buckingham Palace announced on their wedding day: ""The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales have also agreed that the Prince Edward should be given the Dukedom of Edinburgh in due course, when the present title held now by Prince Philip eventually reverts to the Crown."" Edward acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the title after Philip's death, saying: ""It was sort of a pipe dream of my father's ... it will depend on whether or not the Prince of Wales, when he becomes King, whether he'll do that."" Prince Harry's children - Archie, three, and Lilibet, one - became prince and princess six months ago. The changes were made on Buckingham Palace's list of succession page only this week, apparently prompted by the Sussexes' announcement on Wednesday that they had used Lilibet's title for her christening in California. Hugo Vickers, the royal historian, said he was told several weeks ago that Edward was likely to be given the dukedom on his birthday. Charles had announced that William would become Prince of Wales soon after the Queen's death and making public the Edinburgh decision at the same time would have ""diluted"" its impact, he said. ""The wishes and intention of the Queen and Prince Philip have been fulfilled,"" he said. ""Prince Philip has always been supportive of Edward, particularly his work with the Duke of Edinburgh Award."" Vickers said that when he visited Philip in his study, the only picture of his children was a small photograph of Edward. Buckingham Palace said yesterday: ""The new Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh are proud to continue Prince Philip's legacy of promoting opportunities for young people of all backgrounds to reach their full potential."" The title was created in 1726 by King George I for his grandson, Prince Frederick. Frederick's son, Prince George, inherited it and when he became King George III in 1760, it merged with the Crown.

There are a number of firsts, reflecting the wish of the host countries to mark the historic trip by the new King.

He will also be the first member of the royal family to visit the remains of a church bombed by the Allies in the Second World War.

Steinmeier said that he had invited Charles to Berlin at the Queen's funeral in September. ""The fact that he is now taking up this invitation only half a year later shows how much the King values the friendship between our nations,"" Steinmeier said. During their six-day visit, which begins on March 26, Charles and Camilla will travel to Paris and Bordeaux then continue to Berlin and Hamburg. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The visit will celebrate the UK's relationship with France and Germany, marking our shared histories, culture and values. It is also a chance to look forwards and show the many ways our countries are working in partnership, whether that be to tackle climate change, respond to the conflict in Ukraine, seize trade and investment opportunities or share the best of our arts and culture."" A source added: ""The fact that the programme has so many unique ceremonial elements to it does reflect the strength of the relationship and the fact that this is the first state visit of Their Majesties' reign. The atmosphere in which this has all been planned has been extraordinarily positive."" The state visits are at the request of the government and underline the strong European theme of the King's reign. They follow his meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, at Windsor after the announcement of the deal with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. With visits to an organic vineyard in France and green energy projects in Germany, the trip will also be the first opportunity to see on the international stage how Charles's approach to the role differs from that of his late mother. The Palace spokesman added: ""As well as speaking to the strength of the UK's bilateral relationships with France and Germany, Their Majesties' visit will include engagements highlighting the importance of sustainability and community ? key themes which have been embraced by citizens of all our countries. There will also be opportunities to reflect on the sacrifices and challenges of our shared past, out of which has come an enduring legacy of co-operation and reconciliation.""

The cast list, though, is where the similarities to the 2017 election end. This time, Macron is not an exciting disruptor from a nascent party, greeted by crowds of adoring fans at bustling rallies, but a tired incumbent, mostly absent from the campaign trail and obviously jaded after a taxing first term. His opponent is slicker than ever, having abandoned her strident anti-immigrant rhetoric and cast herself as the saviour of the blue-collar worker at the petrol pump. Macron remains the favourite to win the race, which is good news for France and the world - but there is no room for complacency. Much of the campaign has focused on the cost of living. Le Pen has made ""spending power"" her big theme and, notwithstanding her insistence that her promises have been costed by experts, is unafraid of naked retail politics. She has promised to exempt young people from income tax, cut VAT on petrol, lower motorway tolls, and pay for it all with wealth taxes on the rich. After all, the cost of fuel has been a powerful force in French politics before. It was a proposed diesel tax rise that prompted the gilets-jaunes protests in 2018, which became an outlet for dissatisfaction with Macron's governing style. Some of that dissatisfaction remains. Macron's ""Jupiterian"" vision of the presidency, and sometimes galactic vision of his own abilities, have jarred with voters. His decision to disengage from the campaign and focus on governing is understandable during a war in Europe, but will suggest to some that he has not learnt his lesson. On economic policy, however, he has a persuasive story to tell. He promised to deliver economic reform where others had failed and, at least to some extent, he has succeeded. He has cut taxes and liberalised the labour market. The French economy is more dynamic and entrepreneurial. This year unemployment hit a 13-year low. School class sizes have been cut too. The president has much further to go. In particular, the pensions system is in need of urgent reform if the French economy is to stay competitive in the long term. However, in a country where even the whisper of labour market reform is greeted by waves of strikes and howls of indignation from the unions, any progress is impressive. Le Pen has spent five years trying to distance herself further from sinister elements of the far-right. The party name ""Front National"" has gone, and hostility to some forms of immigration is carefully tempered with a vocal welcome to Ukrainian refugees. She has left much of the foreigner-bashing to Éric Zemmour, a rival candidate who has a conviction for hate speech. She has also abandoned talk of a rupture with Europe. Much of the rebranding, however, is sheep's clothing. In place of overt Frexiteerism has come a promise to break European Union law to favour French workers. This would create another political crisis that the EU can ill afford, and bolster ""illiberal democrats"" in Hungary and Poland. Opposition to what she calls ""Islamism"" has remained core to Le Pen's programme - she has pledged to fine women who wear headscarves in public. Most concerning is her lack of commitment to the rules-based order and the western alliance. Not long ago, she was putting photographs of a meeting with President Putin in her campaign literature. She has openly defended his illegal annexation of Crimea. There can be no doubt that a Le Pen victory would be a good news story in Moscow.

After three weeks of fighting the scale of the population movement has exceeded even the most pessimistic forecasts circulating before the war, which suggested that there might be up to five million refugees. There are nearly 6.5 million people who have been driven from their homes but remain inside the country, according to a study by the UN's International Organisation for Migration. That would mean more than a fifth of Ukraine's 44 million population has been displaced, amounting to the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Even this estimate may not reflect the full breadth of the problem, with a further 12 million believed to have been stranded, whether by heavy fighting, the destruction of bridges and other infrastructure, or a lack of resources. ""People continue to flee because they are afraid of bombs, airstrikes and indiscriminate destruction,"" said Filippo Grandi, 64, the head of the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency. There are growing concerns in Europe that the war could stir up another wave of migrants from Africa and the Middle East because of hunger resulting from the collapse in grain and fertiliser exports from Russia and Ukraine, two of the world's largest producers. European Union states have begun arguing about how to cope with the anticipated influx, with Italy and Greece - which sit on two of the main migration routes into the bloc - urging other countries to agree to quotas in advance. War-torn or unstable countries such as Yemen, Lebanon and Libya depend on Ukraine and Russia for substantial fractions of their wheat imports. In addition, they are at the mercy of global prices, which are projected to rise by as much as 22 per cent. Up to now the overwhelming majority of the refugees from the war in Ukraine have crossed into the EU, with about 170,000 believed to have moved to Russia, mostly from Russianoccupied areas. Poland alone has taken in more than two million in the space of three weeks and up to 50,000 a day continue to arrive at its principal border crossings from Ukraine. Moldova, a country of 2.5 million people, has admitted the largest number of refugees relative to its population, although many have used it as a transit country on their journey to other states such as Romania and the Czech Republic. Germany initially expected to receive 225,000 Ukrainians but 218,000 have already come. The country's experience of taking in more than 1.2 million migrants over 2015 and 2016 has left it with a capacious system for processing new arrivals. However, Berlin, Hamburg and several other cities are struggling to cope with daily numbers of refugees that surpass even the peaks of the 2015 migration crisis. Hamburg said it had found space for 15,000 in three weeks, compared with a maximum of 6,000 a month in 2015. The German capital's central station has become so crowded that the state has begun transporting Ukrainians by bus to an impromptu tent city in the old airport at Tegel, where they will be given temporary beds until they can be moved to other parts of the country. The authorities are also having trouble registering the refugees because of a shortage of the devices used to take their fingerprints. ? Campaigners have warned that female Ukrainian refugees face sexual exploitation in Britain unless the government introduces further checks on hosts. Women coming to the UK from the war-torn country should be placed with female hosts to reduce the risk of them being targeted, activists said. After 150,000 people signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, the government announced all those hosting refugee families with children would have enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks. Those not hosting children will undergo basic DBS checks. Jean Hatchet, who campaigns on the issue of men's violence against women, said the government's measures, strengthened last week, were still not good enough. She said: ""Safeguarding should be a priority."" Graphic   Poland alone has taken in more than two million refugees in three weeks",Broadsheet,1
4004,urc_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,19/7/2023,938 words,Roger Boyes,"Europe's lurch to right is not all about migrants; Enraged by green targets and inflation, voters across the Channel are turning to angry politics","If Italy's fiery prime minister Giorgia Meloni is to be believed, ""the hour of the patriots has arrived"". She was speaking at a rally in Valencia for the hard right Vox party which hopes, after this weekend's Spanish general election, to become part of the mini- Trump wave sweeping mainland Europe. From Finland in the north to Spain in the south there is a political surge pushing more nationalist agendas and feeding on suspicion about poorly controlled migration. The European trends can't be easily lumped together but one thing is becoming clear: middle-class voters everywhere are becoming more hard-nosed, less sentimental about grand visions, and more demanding that government leads the way to economic recovery. They have become fearful about their futures. Buried under this continentwide rightward lurch there are probably lessons for the British Conservatives as they peer at Keir, transfixed by Labour's polling. Vox is likely to emerge as kingmaker, the essential ally of a conservative-led People's Party (PP) government in Madrid, marking the arrival of the most ultra-nationalist party since the days of Franco. But although it ticks the expected boxes - blaming Eurocrats for ruining farmers with net zero targets, despairing of expanded gay rights, demanding penalties for insulting the Spanish flag and crown, calling for the closure of mosques where jihad is advocated, claiming the Socialist government of Pedro Sánchez colludes with former Basque terrorists - it also underwrites an economic programme of privatisation, deregulation, stronger property rights, tougher action against squatters and tax cuts. In this way it has made itself electable for entrepreneurs and Godfearing citizens. Many will vote for the mainstream PP, counting on it to civilise the rough-necked Vox politicians. Others will vote directly for Vox precisely because they say what they think. The current polls put the PP ahead at about 35 per cent, Vox at about 15 per cent - enough on the face of it to gain a parliamentary majority since the Socialists are still reeling from regional election losses. The curiosity is this: although Vox is the most determined to expel economic migrants, it is not the central feature. Spain used to be a country of outward emigration; now 16 per cent of its population are migrants. That's less than Germany's 18 per cent and 14 per cent in the Netherlands, but still well above the EU average of 12 per cent. However, Vox, although it demands stronger borders and tougher action on people smugglers, has not (yet) blown the Trumpian trumpet. That's because most Spanish voters don't consider migration an existential issue. Many migrants have come over the years from Latin America and adapted well; they contribute to the country's wealth. And there is a clear if not always easy transition from irregular migration to legal residence. There are, in short, bigger problems than an invasion of small boats. One defining feature of the rise of the European hard right is the sense that the national heartlands are being depopulated (annual births in Spain fell from 408,000 in 2016 to 336,800 in 2021). In between expanding cities there are great dry vacant plains of closing schools and shrinking communities. Labour shortages follow - and so does a more flexible attitude to inward migration. Spaniards say migration is more of an opportunity than a problem; Greeks say the opposite. The resentment of the left-behinds that supposedly powered Brexit is not inevitable, nor need it be a permanent feature of British politics. Germany's hard right Alternative für Deutschland has certainly flourished by playing that card, saying that federal government has to level up more actively the forgotten stretches of the defunct East German state. It has argued that settling migrants and refugees there merely angers the locals and radicalises politics. That's not the reason, though, that the AfD is doing so well - polling at 20 per cent, above the ruling Social Democrats on 18 per cent. Rather, surveys show that the fear factors driving ultra-nationalist support in Germany are topped by inflation, irritation with the Greens imposing expensive net zero targets on households and, only then, just about jointly, the settlement of refugees and the risk of war with Russia. The right-wing revival has this in common across Europe: it is fuelled by the politics of command, whether it be refugee quotas (Poland is furious at the (EURO)20,000 fine being charged for every migrant it refuses to take as part of an EU quota, at a time when it has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees) or the imposition of climate-change targets that involve expensive redesign of German homes. In Stockholm, the radical Sweden Democrats, which prop up a minority centre-right government, want to repatriate powers from the EU - for example, securing an opt-out in justice and home affairs to let Sweden impose stiffer border controls. For post-Brexit Britain these seem like arguments from yesteryear but the language being used on European hustings is far tougher than in the Faragist era. The last thing we need at the moment is the import of angry politics from across the Channel (or the Atlantic). When Meloni hailed the advent of a new patriotism she was issuing a rallying call for populists across Europe. That should have alerted Britain to the problems brewing across the Channel and warned us too not to return to the old Brexit battlefields at home. Migrants are not the enemy: small boats are part of a criminal venture but they are not an invasion. There are bigger problems than an invasion of small boats",Broadsheet,0

A security pact between the allies will be expanded to include co-operation on the high-speed weapons as well as the development of technology to shoot them down. The three nations will also develop electronic warfare and cyber-capabilities as part of the broader Aukus pact. Hypersonic missiles, which can carry nuclear warheads, travel above Mach 5, five times faster than the speed of sound. They cannot be shot down by any missile defence systems developed so far by the West. Russia claimed to have deployed its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in strikes on Ukraine last month, the first time analysts have said they had been used on the battlefield. President Biden described it as ""a consequential weapon"" that was ""almost impossible to stop"". The US has tested its own hypersonic weapons and is collaborating with Australia. But Britain is in the early stages of developing the technology and analysts predict it could take five to ten years to have such a capability. The move highlights concern in the West that it could be falling behind Russia and China, which has tested its own hypersonic weapon. It underscores alarm that Moscow has the power to carry out attacks without being stopped. In other developments: ? Russia will be hit with new US, G7 and European Union sanctions today. The EU will ban imports of Russian coal, but not gas and oil. ? Boris Johnson issued a direct appeal to the Russian people to reject the war, saying that it was a ""stain"" on the country's honour. President Zelensky told the United Nations security council that Russia was committing the worst war crimes since the Second World War and its troops were killing civilians for pleasure. A row has broken out between the Foreign Office and the Home Office over the backlog of UK visas for Ukrainian refugees. The next pivotal battle in the war could be in the eastern city of Slovyansk, analysts believe. They say that Russian forces intend to cut off Ukrainian forces in the east if they take the city. Johnson spoke to Biden and to Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, yesterday to confirm the hypersonic deal. Military sources said the plan was for Britain to develop its own hypersonic missiles, with the scheme being ""accelerated"" with the help of the Americans and Australians. The source said it was a ""classic example"" of how Australia and the US would ""provide wisdom"" to the Britons, as the UK shares information on other capabilities in return. ""We are on the back foot and we don't want to be left behind,"" the source said. ""We are not starting from ground zero but we need to catch up."" Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, head of the armed forces, said of hypersonic weapons last year: ""We haven't [got them] and we must have."" Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the prime minister's national security adviser, said that in light of the invasion of Ukraine, it was ""more important now than ever"" that allies worked together to defend democracy and freedom around the world. A British official said: ""What we've agreed is that hypersonic weapons are going to be an important capability in potential conflicts of the future. Our ability to deter their use and to counter their use will be important parts of maintaining stability across the world."" Research and development will look at the two main types of hypersonic weapons ? glide vehicles and cruise missiles. Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that Britain could have hypersonic weapons in five to ten years, depending on how much classified technology the US was willing to release. Mathieu BoulÈgue, of the Chatham House think tank, said hypersonic weapons were a ""game changer"", adding: ""They can actually navigate to avoid an anti-missile system ... They can evade, avoid and move around by using fluidity of the air. It's extremely novel. It's almost science fiction, but it does exist."" Russia was the first country to introduce a hypersonic intercontinental boost-glide system into service. In 2019 Putin said that the nuclear-capable Avangard hypersonic missile could penetrate future missile defence systems. The missiles have a ""glide system"" that enables great manoeuvrability. ""Not a single country possesses hypersonic weapons, let alone continental-range hypersonic weapons"", the Russian president said at the time. China has since tested its own version of the weapons, as has the US, which did so quietly last month.

4021,urc_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,25/3/2022,758 words,Paul Forsyth,Night stirred by fight bigger than any on the pitch,"When these two nations scrambled to arrange a friendly, it made sense on a number of different levels. It was a chance for Scotland to regain the momentum halted by a four-month break from international football. It was a chance for Poland to prepare for their World Cup play-off final next Tuesday. More than anything, it was a chance for both to acknowledge the plight of their absent friends. Ukraine were supposed to be at Hampden Park last night for their play-off semi-final against Scotland, but Russia's invasion of their country put paid to that. Instead, two teams and their supporters did their bit for victims of the conflict, and what an effort it was: heart-warming, uplifting and a welcome reminder that football can be a force for good. What happened here will not rebuild Mariupol or persuade Vladimir Putin to think again, but it was a moving show of support for those whose lives have been ruined. Not only did it raise awareness, it raised more than a few quid for Unicef's humanitarian effort. With £10 being donated for every ticket sold, a crowd of 39,090 meant that a pretty tidy sum would go towards clean water, food and health supplies in the war-torn country. Add to that the pitchside appeal to viewers at home for a donation by text, and the projected figure was getting on for half a million pounds. Not bad for a sport that gets a bad rap at times, with its hooligans and its over-paid prima donnas. There was none of that here, just a crowd and a game that produced a far better spectacle than any international friendly has a right to expect. Inspired by a cause that was bigger than any on the pitch, the two teams did Ukraine proud with a stirring game and an atmosphere to match. The blue and yellow of Ukraine's flag peppered the crowd. The cover of the match programme was dominated by the same colours. Before the game, the lights went down and a display in the centre circle paid tribute to the country that is refusing to accept defeat. During it, adverts for Unicef circled the pitch on its perimeter advertising. And all the while a terrific Polish support of nearly 5,000 added colour and noise to the occasion. At halftime, a Unicef representative invited supporters to acknowledge the ""incredible humanity"" Poland had shown in opening its doors to so many Ukrainian refugees. The Tartan Army responded with warm applause. In these troubled times, it felt almost insensitive to be poring over details of the match, especially one in which so little was at stake. What did it matter that Scotland were denied their seventh consecutive win with almost the last kick of the ball? Or that the penalty from which Krzysztof Piatek scored was dubious to say the least? People are losing their lives in eastern Europe. Cities are being wiped from the face of the earth. The basic freedoms that were taken for granted just a few short weeks ago are no more. But isn't that the whole point? Nights like these - the kind of simple, trivial distractions that make life worth living - are exactly what they are fighting for in Ukraine. The ultimate sporting gesture to a besieged country that yearns for normality is to respect that wish by preparing as much as possible to beat them. It is the least Steve Clarke, pictured, and his players can do as they await news of when, or if, the play-off semi-final will be contested. If this is any guide, Scotland will be no easy touch. A vibrant display suggested that they have lost none of the confidence gathered towards the end of last year and they are not about to either. While Poland were perhaps more interested in next week's play-off final - Robert Lewandowski stayed on the bench - they were subdued by a side that has so much going for it. Despite his lack of game time for Everton, Nathan Patterson showed that he is still Scotland's future at right back with a rousing, front-foot performance, especially in the first half. John McGinn made their goal, Kieran Tierney scored it and the absence of their captain, Andy Robertson, did not hold them back. There was even a late debut for Aaron Hickey, the latest exciting young talent in this national side. The Scots will be ready for Ukraine, if the game ever takes place. Let's hope it does. If Ukraine are to reach Qatar 2022, they want it to be because they have earned it. If it is not to happen, they want it to be because they were beaten on the pitch and not because they were denied an opportunity. As a country, as a people, as a football team, the right to determine their own fate should not be too much to ask.",Broadsheet,0

Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, unveiled a package of sanctions in the Commons and said that Sberbank, Russia's largest state-controlled lender, would be banned from clearing payments in sterling. Sberbank and VTB, Russia's second largest bank, which was sanctioned last week, account for more than half of the country's banking assets. Truss said that the moves were designed to stop three million Russian companies accessing foreign investment from the UK. ""Global giants like Gazprom will no longer be able to issue debt or equity in London,"" she said. ""[We want] a situation where they can't access their funds, their trade can't flow, their ships can't dock and their planes can't land."" Truss said that before the full measures come into effect, three further banks - VEB, Sovcombank and Otkrytie - would have all their UK assets frozen immediately. The third-largest Russian lender, Gazprombank, a conduit for gas exports, has avoided sanctions. Truss said that the Foreign Office had increased the size of its sanctions unit and was working through a ""hit list"" of further oligarchs to sanction, ""focusing on their houses, their yachts and every aspect of their lives"". The government is expected to publish a list of high-tech exports that will be banned from being sold to Russia as part of a package of measures agreed with the EU and US. Truss and Johnson warned, however, that imposing such stringent sanctions would not be a ""pain-free exercise"" for companies exposed to Russian markets and consumers facing higher gas and petrol prices. The prime minister told his cabinet: ""There is pain for us in inflicting pain on him. We must be prepared to be open and honest with the public. ""It's as nothing compared to the pain of the Ukrainian people."" Johnson said that President Putin had ""grossly miscalculated"" and made a ""huge strategic error"" by assuming that Ukraine could be easily overwhelmed. The Russian leader was caught in a ""colossal mistake believing that the guns of his tanks would be garlanded with roses"", Johnson said. He added that the UK had no problem with the Russian people, but rather with Putin directly. The prime minister indicated that the government would make further concessions to allow Ukrainian refugees to enter the UK. Truss repeated the message in the Commons as she promised help for companies that might lose export markets. ""The UK and our allies will have to undergo some economic hardship as a result of our sanctions,"" she said. ""But our hardships are nothing compared to those endured by the people of Ukraine. ""This is a struggle for Ukraine's freedom and self determination. But it is also a struggle for freedom and democracy everywhere. In Britain and around the world we're prepared to suffer economic sacrifices to support you, however long it takes."" The foreign secretary later posted on Twitter: ""We have taken decisive action. We will degrade the Russian economy and isolate Russia on the world stage. Putin must lose."" The comments came as economic analysts said that the average price of unleaded petrol had risen yesterday to 151.25p, a new record. This time last year it was 123.38p. A litre of diesel climbed to 154.72p, up from 126.47p a year ago. Simon Williams, the RAC spokesman, said: ""This makes a full tank of petrol for a 55-litre family car £83 and diesel £85. The average price of both fuels has shot up by more than 1.5p since Thursday. ""Prices at the pump will continue to go up as retailers buy in new stock at much higher prices. This week will be an important one in terms of the oil price as it's likely to reveal the speed of the inevitable upward trend or the extent of the volatility in the market.""

Fares will rise by 3.8 per cent in a move that campaigners say is ""stoking the fire of the cost of living crisis"". The move will pile hundreds of pounds on to some passengers' annual travel costs. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gave a briefing on the significant impact that the West's sanctions had already had on Russia's economy, causing interest rates to double and leading to the collapse of the rouble.

4090,urc_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,26/1/2023,1522 words,NA,Adrian Shooter; Influential railway executive who made such a success of privatisation that he was honoured with a 9ft bust at Marylebone station,"Few railwaymen are commemorated with a statue at a mainline station in London. The 9ft bust of Adrian Shooter, unveiled beside platform one at Marylebone in August last year, is a tribute not only to one of the few British Rail managers to make a success of privatisation, but to his vision in transforming one of London's smallest stations, once threatened with closure, into the gateway to a dynamic rail franchise. Chiltern Railways, which Shooter founded and managed for 15 years, has led the way in expanding its network, upgrading its trains and stations and building routes to Oxford and Birmingham that offer real competition, and at a cheaper price, to bigger rail franchises. Under Shooter's leadership, Chiltern redoubled more than 30 miles of track cut back by the nationalised British Rail management, opened two new stations and a depot in Wembley, ordered modern and comfortable new trains, and introduced driving simulators to train drivers. There was a setback in 2005, when a tunnel being built at Gerrards Cross to support a new branch of Tesco collapsed on the line, luckily without casualties. And plans to extend the franchise to Wrexham and Shropshire did not survive the veto on trains stopping in Wolverhampton and central Birmingham. But with passenger numbers nevertheless doubling, Chiltern was forced to open two platforms at Marylebone to cope. It was the strongest growth record of any rail company in Europe. By the time Shooter stepped down in 2011 he left a profitable franchise: it had been bought by Deutsche Bahn in 2008, making him chairman of DB Regio UK (later Arriva Rail). He also pioneered the re-use of old railway stock, setting up Vivarail in 2012, a company that planned to convert 228 redundant London Underground vehicles into modern passenger trains powered by battery. These were proposed for use on branch lines or for short distances as they have been for many years on the Isle of Wight. Vivarail, in partnership with the US-based Railroad Development Corp, was a pioneering attempt to develop technology for environmentally sustainable battery transport. During the Cop26 United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021, short demonstration trips were arranged from the city, with Shooter in the driver's seat, and a D-train, as it was known, also crossed the Forth Bridge. Vivarail failed to attract enough investment, however, and announced it would go into administration in November last year. Undoubtedly Shooter had a hand in almost all railway development for the past 30 years. He was chairman of the Association of Train Operating Companies, which ran the privatised operations on Britain's network, between 2001 and 2011. He was also chairman of Churnet Valley Railway, a heritage line, in 2013 and was vice-president of Railfuture, together with Andrew Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary and Chris Green, the former British Rail head of InterCity and Network SouthEast. But railways were not only Shooter's profession: they were also a private passion. He joined the Ffestiniog Railway Society as a 14-year-old schoolboy and as a student with other volunteers helped to build the narrow-gauge Welsh line's diversion around a new reservoir. Fascinated by the old narrow-gauge Indian railways of the British Raj, he became president of a society supporting the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. He owned a Class B Darjeeling steam locomotive 778, which he used to maintain himself and drive on a light railway that he built in the grounds of his residence in north Oxfordshire. The son of Professor Reginald Shooter, a microbiologist, and Jean Wallace, a doctor, Adrian Shooter was born in London in 1948 and was educated at Epsom College, where he started a Road Transport Society. As a schoolboy in the last days of steam, he organised a special excursion from London to Derby and Crewe. However, his hopes of a university place to read engineering at Leeds were dashed when he failed his maths A-level. Instead, he joined a firm in Uttoxeter as an apprentice, gaining an HND in mechanical engineering at North Staffordshire Polytechnic. In 1970 he was taken on by British Railways as a management trainee, and by the age of 25 had already become a maintenance engineer at Bletchley, heading a large team. He rose steadily in BR, becoming a depot manager at Heaton, near Newcastle, moving then to Carlisle as area maintenance engineer, working on expansion projects in Bournemouth and Selhurst, near Croydon, and eventually becoming area manager at St Pancras - a job that gave him responsibility for the whole of the London Midland Region's rail territory. Always hands-on, he once rushed to Halfords to stock up on de-icing sprays when an especially cold snap resulted in the doors sticking on a fleet of trains running out of St Pancras. He was involved in the establishment of Red Star Parcels, but this did not go so well, as the Royal Mail contract made a substantial loss. It was sold to a management buyout in 1993. The main break in his career came with his appointment to Chiltern, then part of BR, at a time when the Major government was preparing plans to privatise the industry. Shooter - with his potent combination of engineering skills, commercial nous and dogged determination - was quick to organise a management buyout, putting together the M40 Trains consortium with financial backing from John Laing and 3i. He argued for a much longer franchise than most of the new privatised operating companies were given, getting a 20-year run for Chiltern in 2000, which made it worthwhile to invest heavily in the line. As investment improved the line, it grew from a sleepy railway largely serving affluent Buckinghamshire commuters to an alternative intercity route to the Midlands. For much of his career he was responsible for railway safety and environmental technology in Britain. In 1993 he established an exchange programme with Japanese railway companies, training more than 200 people and working on the adoption of Japanese automatic train stopping systems in the UK and their widespread use in Britain. In recognition of his work he received a number of doctorates from British universities, and was appointed CBE in 2010. Shooter was active as a lecturer, lobbyist and as a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the Chartered Institute of Transport. An amiable man, he had a range of hobbies, especially vintage rallying. This became a passion for him and his wife Barbara. ""It was where we had the best times together,"" she said. They owned at least eight vintage cars, and each year, from 2008 onwards, would go rallying abroad. In all, they drove through more than 70 countries, along remote and often challenging roads. On one rally they drove through central Tibet, on others through India and Myanmar, Japan, New Zealand, Namibia and most of Indo-China. ""We probably have seen most of the world that way,"" mused Barbara. They also undertook a rally from Georgia in the US to the North Cape in Alaska. The rallies and Shooter's career were brought to a sad and sudden halt when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2021. He continued to lecture, and in April last year he and Barbara even took two Ukrainian refugees into their home, but the disease soon began to take its toll on his body. Indeed, he already had difficulty moving when he attended the unveiling of his statue in Marylebone station and was asked to name a train after himself, with the keynote speech given by Lord McLoughlin, the former transport secretary. The bust was crowdfunded by rail industry leaders. Shooter said he accepted the honour ""only on the condition that it recognises the amazing efforts of the hundreds of railwaymen and women who I have worked with"". He added: ""All I ever did was create the vision, hire the very best people and then help them to do their best."" Shooter married twice, first to Diana Crombie, and then, after divorce, to Barbara, née Harding, in 2006. He had two children from his first marriage: Alastair, who works for DHL, and Victoria, who works in government communications. Barbara and his children survive him. He arranged to travel to Switzerland to end his life at the time of his choosing, and issued a poignant statement for release by his wife after his death. It said: ""By the time you read this, I shall have gone peacefully to sleep at a clinic in Switzerland. This is very much what I wanted to do. As I write this, my MND symptoms are getting rapidly worse, with the result that I cannot exist without constant care and attention to the most basic requirements. If I had not done this, I would have been condemned to months or quite possibly years of being confined to bed, unable to do anything for myself including talking."" For such a sociable and active man, that would surely have been unbearable. Adrian Shooter CBE, railway executive, was born on November 22, 1948.

Inside the care home everyone wants to live in; Could a pioneering housing project in Denmark where nonagenarians mix with young families and twenty somethings be the answer to Britain's social care crisis? Rachel Sylvester reports PORTRAIT Tom Jackson,"I n the entrance hall at the House of Generations an electric mobility scooter is lined up next to a push-along children's scooter. An elderly man shuffles by with a walking frame while a little boy whizzes past on a tricycle. There are board games in the dining room, a climbing frame in the garden and weekly music-and-movement sessions for young and old. This innovative housing project on the waterfront in Aarhus, Denmark's second biggest city, is pioneering a new form of intergenerational living that could offer a solution to the crisis in social care while also boosting the supply of affordable housing and delivering high quality pre-school education. The House of Generations is the care home of the future, where the elderly play an active part in the community rather than being shut away behind closed doors. At the same time it provides cheap accommodation for students, low-cost homes for young families and reliable childcare for working parents. It is simultaneously fixing three of the trickiest social policy conundrums facing many western countries and, since the start of the Ukraine war, some of the flats have been given over to refugees fleeing the conflict too. The aim, explains Kristian Dall, the manager, is to create a neighbourhood where people can live happily for their whole lives. ""It is a modern version of a traditional village where everybody knows each other,"" he says. As all countries struggle to deal with ageing populations and increasingly atomised societies, policymakers have been coming from around the world to visit the Danish experiment and see what they can learn. Around 300 people live in the House of Generations, which opened in the autumn of 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 crisis. It took a while to fill up because mixing between ages was discouraged during the pandemic, but now more people can see the advantages. There are 100 retirement homes, where residents have daily visits from a care worker, and 100 nursing homes, which come with more intensive medical support. Scattered between the apartments for the elderly are 40 family homes, 40 youth flats and 24 apartments for disabled people. Each corridor has a demographic mix. Some flats have shared kitchen and bathroom facilities S A/ SWECO and others are self-contained. GWAD, EL- There is a nursery with 150 places as well as a craft room, a carpentry workshop, a music studio and a gym. A kayak hangs from one wall and the table in the corridor is scattered with children's paintings. ABD AHMED JACKSON, Older residents babysit for young families and students help solve the pensioners' technology problems. One elderly man is planning to get five chickens to keep on TOM the roof terrace, which has a garden. ""The children can help look after them,"" says Dall. Once a week groups of children from the nursery move to the nursing home sections around the House and do their activities there so that the oldest residents can enjoy the company of the youngest. Soeren Nissen, 65, makes sure not to miss these weekly visits, trundling to the sessions on his mobility scooter. ""I like it so much. We sing together. My flat is above the kindergarten so I can hear them all day. My grandchildren love to come here."" He has a box of Lego in his flat for young visitors. ""When people ask me do I like living here, I always say, 'No, I love it,'"" he says. ""We speak together, eat together. I'm in the nursing home department so we don't make our own food. It's breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, tea, cakes, the whole day. I have an alarm so I can call the nurses if I need to."" He has a heart condition but he is not giving up on life just yet. ""I've got a girlfriend,"" he says with a twinkle in his eye. ""She's 92 but age doesn't matter in this house."" Down in the nursery on the ground floor, teacher Anne Bents, 24, insists her young pupils benefit just as much as the older residents. ""They learn how to socialise and to show some empathy. It gives them a different perspective, an understanding that you have to take care not only around smaller children, but also that older people can be fragile too. It helps the younger ones mature and I think for the older ones it gives some life joy back."" There is no requirement for younger people to join shared activities, but they are encouraged to volunteer, helping those in wheelchairs down to the hall for a concert or going for a walk with someone who might be lonely. Per Lidell, 68, says the residents are currently trying to raise money to buy some double bikes so an elderly or disabled person can sit next to an able-bodied rider. ""Of course we will need somebody who is strong enough to push the pedals, so you need the young people to participate. Then we have a new feature, which is the Friday afternoon bar. All the generations are there. There's always something going on."" That includes concerts, movie nights and an annual music festival. It must be hard to find a film that everyone wants to watch but Lidell says it is an eclectic mix. ""Last time it was an old Danish movie, but I'm recommending a horror film next."" Lidell shows me around his flat in the ""home care"" section of the house. In his youth he was a sailor and the walls are lined with pictures of boats. Now he has Parkinson's disease and walks with a frame. ""It was a strategic decision to move here,"" he says. ""The Parkinson's was getting worse, so I thought to myself, it's better to find a place where you are close to the nurses but you still have interaction with young people."" The House of Generations grew out of a need for more social care provision in Aarhus, but the mix of ages living at the property means it can tap into multiple local authority budgets. ""The whole House has four owners,"" says Dall. ""There are three different departments in the municipality, for schoolchildren, the elderly and disabled people. Then we have a private housing association involved too."" Like Britain, Denmark has a growing number of older people. The government has made it a priority for elderly citizens to stay in their own home for as long as possible. Local authorities are required by law to visit everyone at home in the years they turn 75 and 80 to assess their need. Those who are living alone at 70 are also included. These preventive home visits are designed to reduce the number of people ending up unnecessarily in hospital or in residential care. The municipalities have a legal duty to provide social care for patients being discharged from hospital. If they cannot do so then they have to pay the hospital for the cost of the extra nights on the ward. This has created a strong incentive to innovate. The focus is on empowering rather than infantilising the elderly. At the House of Generations there is a much greater degree of flexibility than in a conventional care home - people can increase or decrease the support they receive as they age. Independence is encouraged but back-up is on hand if it is suddenly required. Elderly residents pay for their accommodation and food, with care costs funded by the state. The most intensive nursing home apartments cost the individual around £1,000 a month in rent, comparable to the weekly cost of a place in the UK. This is topped up by another £3,800 from the public purse. The student rate is just over £500 a month and the average rent in the family apartments is £1,100. The cost is similar to other properties in the city, but the shared facilities are much better than in most municipal apartment blocks. Arranged over eight buildings on the docks at Aarhus harbour, the House of Generations has been featured in architectural magazines. The communal areas are bright, airy and modern. There is a sweeping pale wooden staircase leading up from an atrium and sculptures positioned around the house. The property has been designed to encourage people to meet. The letterboxes are all in one central hall and there is a shared laundry as well as communal gardens. ""The architects call it 'insisting' architecture,"" says Dall. ""The stairs don't just go up and down; you have to move around. The common rooms are placed all over the house in order for the residents to get to know each other. You have to interact."" I meet Brigette Binger, 42, as she is collecting her two youngest children from the nursery. Hannibal is 4 and Henry is 1. She says the biggest attraction for families like hers is convenience. ""We can just take the escalator down to the kindergarten. The playground is just outside."" She thinks the children get a huge emotional benefit from mixing with older people. ""They love it. They learn to chill and have fun. It's not forced. This is definitely something that could be copied around the world. I only see benefits from it."" The Ukrainian refugees have fitted right in. Tetyana Petroniuk, a musician, arrived last June and is now working as a cleaner as well as volunteering as a guitar teacher for residents. Her daughter Maria, 13, runs a dance class. They are both learning Danish. ""We like it here so much,"" Maria says. ""It's a really cool place."" There are already multiple generations of the same family living there. Morten Krogsholm, a 32-year-old freelance video maker, moved in last August with his partner, Carla. His sister-in-law was already living here with her children. He visited for his nephew's 13th birthday party and immediately applied for a place. He has become the unofficial handyman, offering to build Ikea furniture for the elderly residents. ""Some people call me the social janitor,"" he says but he insists it is not all one way. ""I've benefited a lot. It's nice to be part of some kind of community."" This may sound like Scandi idealism to cynical Brits, but the social care crisis in this country means that fresh thinking is needed. There are 2.6 million older people in England unable to get the support they need and 165,000 social care vacancies as demoralised staff quit for better paid supermarket jobs. The record waiting lists in the NHS are driven in part by the 13,000 people stuck in hospital who are medically fit to be discharged. Many are waiting for social care. There is also a desperate shortage of affordable housing, for the young. Parents struggle to pay spiralling childcare costs. The House of Generations is killing three birds with one stone. The idea of intergenerational care has already been piloted successfully in this country. The Nightingale House care home in Clapham, southwest London, has a nursery on its premises. Children take part in singing, gardening and cooking with the elderly residents. In its latest inspection report, the Care Quality Commission said that older people using the service found that the interactions with the young ""uplifted them, brought endless joy to their lives and took away the focus of an ageing mindset"". The House of Generations has simply taken it to another level, integrating housing, welfare, education and social care in a way that has economic and emotional benefits for all. Back in Aarhus, the knitting group has gathered in an upstairs kitchen. A dozen elderly women are sitting around a table, overlooking a playground where children are playing. It is 2pm and the wine is flowing. A few needles are clacking but the focus seems to be more on chatting than knitting. The women are discussing a coach tour to the north of Denmark later in the year. Soeren Nissen's eyes light up as he introduces me to his girlfriend. Johanna Hoejgaard smiles like a teenager as she confirms their regular dinner dates. ""I feel like a duchess,"" she says. ""My daughters say I've gained an additional ten years by moving here. Now my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all want to move in too."" n Rachel Sylvester is chairwoman of the Times Health Commission Older residents babysit for young families while students solve their tech problems Graphic   From left: Per Lidell, 68, Brigette Binger, 42, with two of her children, Henry, 1, and Hannibal, 4, and Soeren Nissen, 65, and his girlfriend, Johanna Hoejgaard, 92, all residents of the House of Generations in AarhusThe exterior of the House of GenerationsSoeren and Johanna",Broadsheet,0
4105,urc_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,2/7/2022,3325 words,NA,ANNEKA RICE TO THE RESCUE! (THIRTY YEARS LATER); In the Nineties she dashed across primetime TV in a jumpsuit solving the nation's problems - now Anneka Rice is back. She tells Andrew Billen how a troubled childhood prepared her for anything and why she stepped away at the height of her fame,"Why should British television now be choosing to bring back Challenge Anneka, that giant of Nineties Saturday night family viewing predicated on the young Anneka Rice galvanising citizens into making life better for their fellow human beings? My theory is that, like 30 years ago, this is again the fin-desiÈcle of Tory austerity and we are pining once more for deeds of collective generosity. Amid death and now poverty, we have clapped through Covid Thursdays, vax-volunteered and baked for the Jubilee. Television's subsequent hits The X Factor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? changed individual lives. Challenge Anneka transformed communities. Perhaps we are up for that again. Anneka Rice has her own hunch, however. ""I think it's that the people who are now making television programmes remember it,"" she tells me in the London photo studio where, in sparkly jumpsuits, she has just finished faking derring-do aboard an untethered rope ladder and a killer motorbike. ""They were kids then. Now they've got the power. The commissioners at all these channels grew up on Challenge."" It is as good a theory as any other. Between 1989 and 1995, Rice claimed the nation's hearts, especially men's hearts, and set them racing to her aid. Every week a call to accomplish a fresh mission impossible would be answered. Prisoners from Wormwood Scrubs helped set up a pony centre for equestrians with special needs. Mencap owes its building in Leeds to Challenge Anneka. A Birmingham schoolteacher called Monica McDaid was among the volunteers who responded in 1990 to her plea to turn a hellish Romanian orphanage into a place of humanity and love. McDaid is out there still and two of the orphans she and Rice met on their first visit to Siret have grown up, married and this year given up their beds to Ukrainian refugees. And these are merely the challenges Rice mentions in our interview. There were some 60, and she can tell you what has become of each of them. Tomorrow [July 3] she will be at a 30th anniversary party for the Albrighton Trust in Wolverhampton where her volunteers built a moat that allows anglers of all ages and disabilities to fish. On her phone, she shows me a video of a recent visit there. I watch David, a young and disabled volunteer, hug her and haltingly explain that Rice is his hero. She responds, ""David, no, you are my hero."" Let's call it quits and call them both heroes. During its original six-year run Rice always sheepishly referred to the show as ""the challenge programme"", but it was her charisma that lured the volunteers to the tasks and her enthusiasm that made them see them through. I want to avoid being either sexist or rude, but it wasn't really about her looks. It was about her personality. ""I think it was. I can't believe Challenge was about my looks because, honestly, half the time I had a hard hat on, I was splattered with rain, mud. It wasn't a glamour thing."" It was about her spirit. ""That's a lovely thing to say. Thank you. I'm very flattered by that but I think it's about everyone's spirit. It's about the goodness of the human spirit. And it's always been there."" I mention the jubilee street parties. ""But, you know, someone on your street will have had the clipboard, organising that. There will always be one person and then everyone goes, 'Yes! We want to run away and join the circus with the mad lady.' "" Building jubilee trifles is one thing, but facing the horror of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's orphanages quite another. Before we meet, I watch the 1990 programme again. When I am not averting my eyes, what I see emanating from Rice, as these damaged children invade her space, is not horror but love. I would have flinched, made my excuses. She looks surprised. ""When I go into a room, I've always headed for the most vulnerable person there. I just have."" Where was this empathy born? Well, 63-year-old Anne Rice (she changed her name for the usual Equity reasons) was born in Cowbridge, south Wales. She grew up in Surrey, the daughter of a father in the building trade who was always working and a mother who, politely put, declined to let motherhood define her. Having chosen to study at Goldsmiths College, when Anneka was 15, her mother announced she was not getting on with Rice's father and was considering moving to Scotland. ""I grew up with a lot of jeopardy in my childhood, a lot of insecurity,"" she says. What, I gather, really hurt was her parents' benign neglect. To grab their attention she began shoplifting. ""I honestly never shoplifted anything for myself. I just took things for the frisson that I might be caught. I hoped a policeman would take me home in a police car and my parents would have to acknowledge that I existed. Once I was caught and it was thrilling. It was Jean Machine in Croydon. And there was a crowd outside the shop windows watching. I remember thinking, 'This is very exciting,' really quite enjoying the moment, and the policeman coming and taking down my particulars and I thought I was quite clever because instead of my name and my address, I gave the name of the horrible bully in my class who was causing a lot of distress to me and a lot of others. I thought she might as well have the criminal record. But I was very disappointed because they just said, 'Well, we'll let you off.' "" So they didn't take her home? ""No, because what I'd stolen was men's trousers, size 42, and it was patently not anything I wanted."" So she never got her parents' attention? ""Never got the attention."" She insists she came to admire her mother for wanting to do her own thing and wants to be clear that her parents, both now dead, made excellent grandparents. Still, all her life she looked for alternative families. An amateur artist, she once did a project on families for Grayson Perry's Art Club programme. ""I painted this huge long frieze, over 5ft long, and the family I started painting was all my childhood dolls and heroines in children's books, because they were really key to me. People like Jo March [in Little Women], Katy Carr and Cousin Helen [in What Katy Did] - all these characters were so important to me. I've still got all my old books, all my dolls. They were my family when I was smaller."" One consequence of the chaos of her actual family was that when her sister was born, when Rice was 11, she took on much of her rearing. ""I would take my sister to nursery, and then do double chemistry at school. That makes you a very organised person."" Did she resent it? ""No, not at all. I adored my little baby sister."" In fact, she had chanced upon a coping strategy. She began to live by a line from Winnie the Pooh: ""Piglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful that he forgot to be frightened any more."" At her small private school in Kent there was more chaos. It was like St Trinian's, she says: there was arson about (literally), and also teenage sex. ""I was definitely at school always the go-to person. You know, if someone needed an abortion or something I'd be the person who'd crowdfund for it."" She's not joking, is she? ""No. My life has been mad."" (Her pregnant friend was called Katy and Anneka's first successfully completed fundraising challenge raised £80.) Moving to Croydon High School, she attained three A levels, good but not good enough to follow her peers to Oxbridge. Instead, without asking her parents' advice, she wrote to the BBC. Aged 17 she won a traineeship at the World Service. It sounds as if she emerged very strong from her childhood. She says, the reverse. ""I came out riddled with insecurities, ran away to the BBC and found my community, found my gang, my family."" It was a big family that extended far beyond BBC Bush House. She would pick up a phone and go, ""Hello Delhi, this is London,"" and Mark Tully, the BBC's man in India, would answer. Significantly, she had an inspiring woman boss, Monica Sims, later the first female controller of Radio 4. ""She was very, very supportive. In fact, she was pretty determined I should be on the other side of the camera. She sent me off to the natural history unit to be tried out for Animal Magic or some similar show. I was not really very interested in this and the producer wrote saying - I've still got this letter - 'Anne is obviously very intelligent, but she'll never work in front of the camera because of the gap in her teeth.' "" What gap, I ask, fruitlessly examining her mouth. ""I said to Monica, 'I don't care if I've got a gap in my teeth. I've no intention of being in front of a camera anyway.' "" Then, aged 19, she did something crazy. She took off for Hong Kong. The BBC was mystified; her parents, she thinks, neither interested nor bothered. She landed a job as a copy editor on a TV station. One day the newsreader was taken ill and reasoning, correctly as it turned out, that reading the news had to be easier than writing it, she volunteered. As ever, in her spare hours, she wanted to be Useful and worked in refugee camps for Vietnamese boat people. ""What can you do? You go along and you sing with the kids or you try to help the mums there."" After three years she returned to Britain, her presenter's credentials established and her volunteerism reinforced. The recently launched Channel 4 recruited her as the ""sky-runner"" on its Treasure Hunt. (The show's 40th anniversary is this year, and the symmetry with the rebirth of her TV career appeals to her.) Filmed as live, the programme required Rice to find a hidden prize typically secreted in a historic monument. Transported by helicopter from clue to clue, she would be urged on in the studio by Kenneth Kendall, a gentlemanly retired BBC newsreader who could hear but not see her. ""Hurry, hurry, Anneka,"" he would say. I recall a young, longhaired woman in a jumpsuit rushing about doing an elderly man's bidding. She thinks it was ahead of its time. ""It had a woman at the centre of control, calling the shots. It was a very strong image, wasn't it?"" Absolutely. Striding into these National Trust castles without a ticket. ""But you know, at that point women were not seen in that light, as someone in control and strong."" They weren't even seen moving very much. ""No, they were behind a newsreader's desk or draped over a car at a motor show in bikinis or over a prize on Sale of the Century. That was it."" I admit that growing up in the same era as her I thought there was nothing odd about it. ""Well,"" she says, ""I always thought there was something odd about it."" In 1986 she was named Rear of the Year, a moniker invented by publicists to sell jeans. The accolade, which she cheerfully but bemusedly accepted - she considered she had very little rear - does suggest that a proportion of Treasure Hunt's audience was watching for more than a history lesson. I wonder whether she thinks being an attractive woman helped or hindered her career. ""I don't even see that. It would be disingenuous to say that I'm not aware of people like you asking that question but all I can say is growing up it didn't even occur to me. All through the World Service, I always felt very judged on what I was doing."" Treasure Hunt's rough and tumble appealed to her sense of jeopardy. It also landed her in A&E. ""Because I had this headset on, I couldn't ever hear ambient noise, and I ran onto a racecourse at Hickstead and a horse knocked me flying. I just picked myself up and carried on."" When she left the show in 1988, it was to launch this new programme she had devised with the Treasure Hunt producer Malcolm Heyworth. Challenge Anneka would combine its technical innovation with good deeds. It too brought spells in hospital, this time from forgetting to drink during filming and developing kidney stones. ""Because the buck stops with me, I'm just always there with a clipboard, not having a drink, basically."" Rice jokes that the wall planner and the clipboard were invented for her. Although she consults neither during our interview, I certainly sometimes feel planned and clipped. We are talking on the understanding there are ""red lines"" my questions must not cross (as with superinjunctions, what lies beyond those lines may also not be revealed - but perhaps you can guess). Later she writes asking me to mention in the piece the Albrighton Trust's anniversary (done). She allows me to come to a recording in east London of her forthcoming Radio 4 show, Anneka Has Issues, but on the condition I do not quote her act since it would be out of context (um, all right). She additionally suggests that at this comedy club I ""ditch the suit"" (out of sheer defiance I refuse, and even wear a tie). Continues on page 36 Although she regularly interviews on Radio 4's Loose Ends, and gives, I think, a brilliant interview herself, the process makes her anxious, presumably because she cannot control the outcome. This is more an observation than a criticism. At the comedy club recording there are repeated issues with a clip that refuses to play but she meets them with a grace that a true control freak would surely be unable to summon. In any case, as she says, nothing gets done without an organiser with a clipboard, and Rice wielded hers to greater effect than perhaps anyone on television. What is more, she did so while bringing up three boys, the first of whom must have still been in nappies when she made that initial trip to Romania. I ask if she felt guilty. ""I knew my baby was going to be fine while I was in Romania. I just made all that work, but I felt very guilty leaving the kids in Romania,"" she replies. In 1995, not long after splitting up with her husband, the theatre producer Nick Allott, she quit television. At first her children, small and portable, had joined her on location: ""We set up a sort of playroom in a truck and they grew up thinking they were part of a building team. They thought I was some kind of lorry driver and Dave the Soundman was an uncle."" But once the boys were at school full-time it became harder so she put her career on hold. Was she also fed up with being famous? ""I wasn't very good with the fame thing,"" she admits. ""I'd get in a car and they [the paparazzi] would be out on bikes while I tried to take the kids to school. I was very famous in the Nineties because I was on telly on something or other most nights of the week and there was not the dilution of lots of different channels and Netflix. Everybody knew you, which was lovely for Challenge because it meant that everyone wanted to help but it was a tricky way to bring up children."" For a while she kept a retreat in the Cotswolds, just so she and the boys could be spared press intrusion. One day a reporter knocked on her door. Distressed, she pleaded with him to keep her secret. Because he worked for a decent local paper he agreed. There was other stuff going on. In a recent charity podcast, On the Marie Curie Couch, she talked about her grief after a close friend died following what was supposed to be a routine operation. She said she had ""never really moved on"" from this period in her early thirties, which was around the time, she added, that her marriage was breaking up. ""It's just an inherent sadness I feel the whole time. association ""I think I was 32,"" she tells me. ""I lost a few friends around that time. It was really weird. I lost three very, very good friends who were absolutely pivotal to my life because they knew me very well and they knew my strange press background and they were my hinterland."" And she never lost that underlying sadness? ""Oh no, no, no, that's not true. I'm probably quite a complicated person because of my weird childhood. There's just always an undercurrent of empathy for other people."" On another podcast, she was challenged for having posted on Instagram an amazing foreign sunset, adding beneath something like, ""Don't worry, the rest of my life is shit."" ""It's not at all,"" she says, but, ""One thing that's awful about Instagram is people talk about wonderful everything. I hope I never do that. My worst thing is when people go, 'I'm so blessed.' That drives me mad."" Does she feel blessed? ""I'm not even answering that question,"" she protests. ""It's all the layers that make you what you are. I don't want the shiny outward layer. Everyone can do one of those very adequately. It's the layers that we've all got, the knocks and the threadbare bits and all the bits that collectively make us human."" She tried psychotherapy, but it was not for someone who found mental strength in other people rather than introspection. ""I tried Jungian therapy, which is when you write down your dreams. And apart from the fact that I impaled myself on my pen because you have to keep your pen next to your pillow, my subconscious felt like a torture chamber. Even my therapist used to be slightly concerned. I'd end up as the one giving her the tissues and saying, 'Are you all right?'"" What were her nightmares? ""In my main dream I was always in a small room with high walls and my children were trapped on the other side and the walls were closing in on me. I remember that very clearly. I don't want to know why that's a dream I'm having. I'd rather not know what my psyche is thinking."" Soon though, we shall see the shiny, wildly optimistic surface of Rice once more. Really, she insists, the Challenge programme has never been away. She owns the rights to the format and somewhere in the world, she reckons, a version has been playing throughout the past three decades. And, of course, her unfilmed visits to those old projects have never stopped. Not that her helping out ends there. She is a Samaritans volunteer. Although her main home is now on the Isle of Wight, she still frequently meets a group of ""old ladies"" in Barnes, southwest London, through a local association called FiSH, which stands for Friendship, Independence, Support and Help. She has not exactly been absent from the media during the Challenge hiatus. She is a frequent panel game panellist, had a brave but doomed few weeks on Strictly Come Dancing in 2019, and for years presented regularly on Radio 2. On stage she once performed Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues. Challenge, however, is Ur-Anneka, not least because it is where, in Jackie Weaver terms, she has the authority. This morning she chooses not to engage with the debate about the relative absence of older women from our screens, but she does feel strongly that women's ""brands"" are eroded by age in a way men's are not. Announcing Challenge Anneka's return, she told the Today programme she felt no different from how she felt 30 years ago. ""I really don't. I don't."" She looks just the same. ""Oh, don't. Look at those photos [we have just taken]. I was horrified. But the thing is I don't really feel any different."" After I turn off my recorder, I mention the theory developed by our own Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson in their book, What I Wish I'd Known When I Was Young, that adults who make big differences have frequently emerged from dysfunctional childhoods. Rice can explain that. If no one is noticing what you are doing as a child you end up not ""giving a shit"" what people think of you for trying to change things. I ask her to repeat that for the microphone. She cleans it up: ""I think if you've had a fractured childhood and you don't feel a bed of security, there is a devil-may-care attitude to the way you live your life. You assume no one will care what happens to you anyway, so you might as well go out and forge things in the bigger community of the world."" My Anneka challenge right now is to alight on a closing thought that sums her up. Typically, it turns out she has done the job for me. Yes, on one level she does not give the proverbial. On another, caring is all Anneka Rice cares about. Anneka Has Issues begins at 6.30pm on July 20 on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds. Challenge Anneka will be coming to Channel 5 soon 'i was the go-to person at sChool. if someone needed an abortion i'd Crowdfund it' 'my therapist used to be slightly concerned. i'd end up as the one giving her tissues' Graphic   Anneka Rice, 63, wears jumpsuit, ?315, nadinemerabi.com; ring, ?5,800, www.robinsonpelham.com.
