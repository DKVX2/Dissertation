Palanca in south-east Moldova has a population of 2,000 but is one of the main border crossings for those fleeing the war. Its mayor, Dumitru Cozlovschi, said he was proud of the way his people responded to the sudden influx of evacuees. He said: ""I was not surprised. I knew that Moldovans are kind and helpful in times of need. But I was not sure how many families could actually host somebody."" In the immediate aftermath of Vladimir Putin's onslaught, the free bus system that now ferries people to Romania or larger Moldovan cities had yet to be set up. Some refugees - mostly women and children - crossed the border with no idea what their next step would be. Mr Cozlovschi began calling residents to ask whether they would take people in. Half of the remote village's 250 homes have volunteered. And since the war started 1,000 refugees have been registered as staying in Palanca for at least one or two weeks. Mr Cozlovschi said the true figure is likely to be higher. Around 200 adult refugees and 80 children are still living in Palanca. Among them is Diana Avetisian, 20, who fled Odesa with her boyfriend and his family. They are staying at Casa Veche guesthouse, one of three in the village supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). She said: ""We heard the sound of bombing and decided to pack our stuff and get out."" Diana's boyfriend Roman Riabykh, 25, crossed the border just an hour before men aged 18 to 60 were banned from leaving Ukraine. They were with his mum Marina Vinogridova, 44, and brother Hleb, nine. Diana said she was grateful to be able to stay close to the border and her parents, who remain in Odesa. She added: ""It's amazing. We didn't expect Moldovan people to treat us so well.

Enter your details on the official website, homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk Who can apply? Anyone can volunteer to be a host, but initial sponsors are likely to have connections with specific refugees. How many refugees can I host? That depends on how much space you have. You will be asked how many spare rooms are in your property. What happens next? From later this week, Ukrainian refugees will be able to apply for a UK visa through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. How long can they stay in Britain? A visa allows them to stay for up to three years with the right to work, access the NHS and claim most benefits. Councils will be given a grant of £10,500 per refugee to provide support with extra for the costs of schooling. What must hosts do? They will be expected to accommodate the evacuees for a minimum of six months. Each participating household will be given a £350-a-month thank you' from the Government. Could their benefits or taxes be affected? No. The £350 a month is tax-free. Mr Gove said taking a refugee into your home will not affect a host's benefits or their council tax status, for example claims for single occupancy discount. What safety checks are in place? British hosts will have to undergo only very light-touch' criminal records checks, while the refugees will be vetted against British and international security databases. © Daily Mail","Tabloid",1,"2022-03",1,"Aid"

Scores of Ukrainian evacuees expressed their frustration at British red tape yesterday, including some sent to a Home Office centre in Lviv in the war-torn country that had shut down days earlier. It was announced last night that 100 British military personnel in civilian dress are going to Poland to help organise the visa application centre (VAC) in Warsaw. It came as former prime minister David Cameron suggested the UK's programme should be more generous. One option could be allowing Ukrainians into Britain just by showing their passports, he told LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr, adding: Let's find a way to get it done.' The Daily Mail understands the Home Secretary is planning to unveil significant moves to streamline the refugee scheme and open it to all Ukrainians with family in Britain, although she will stop short of dropping visa requirements altogether. New measures will mean Ukrainians already here for work or on other short-term visas will be able to apply for a free three-year visa that will let them to bring relatives here, Home Office sources said. Until now the refugee scheme has been limited to relatives of Ukrainians with permanent rights to be in the UK. In further moves planned by ministers, refugees who have visited Britain in the past five years will be able to re-use biometrics from earlier visa applications. This will aim to reduce bottlenecks at VACs across the continent where refugees must attend appointments to have fingerprints and facial scans taken. The number of refugee visas granted so far reached 957 yesterday as the Education Secretary predicted Britain will end up taking in around 200,000. Nadhim Zahawi, whose family fled Saddam Hussein's Iraq, told The Spectator the Government had struck the right balance because it's right to have some checks as to who we're settling here'. The planned changes to the visa scheme come amid fierce criticism of Britain's existing set-up. A senior Tory source said: Priti Patel's stock is falling fast. People want us to be generous, the Prime Minister is saying he wants to be generous, but reality on the ground is making a mockery of that. The Home Office has to stop looking at this from the point of view of trying to control numbers. The point of controlling our borders is we can choose to be generous when circumstances demand.' Another Whitehall insider said: Priti has not got a grip on this. What we are seeing is the classic Home Office approach of trying to bureaucratise everything and squeeze the numbers, which is the opposite of what the PM is asking for - it's not surprising he's getting frustrated with her.' An ally of Miss Patel acknowledged it was taking time to get the process running smoothly but said it was not fair to blame it all on her'. The source voiced irritation with Michael Gove's Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which has yet to produce details of the new sponsorship route' for refugees. Priti is getting all the flak for refugees, but there is nothing she can do about the sponsorship route until Gove has decided what it is,' the source said. Downing Street insisted yesterday that Boris Johnson still has full faith' in the Home Secretary. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko also criticised bureaucratic hassles' yesterday, telling the Commons home affairs committee that, for example, biometric checks should be dropped for child evacuees. A pop up' VAC will open in Lille, France, today but will only deal with applicants referred by Border Force officers at Calais, where hundreds of Ukrainian refugees have already turned up. Other applicants are being urged to go to other centres across Europe. But a British-Ukrainian sales manager Vitalii Morgun, 36, who drove to the Hungarian border with Ukraine to collect family who had fled, said that when they reached the Brussels VAC he was shocked to find just two officials on duty. It's a joke… it's hopeless,' he said. And a British citizen, Joe from Hampshire, who flew to Poland to help get his mother and niece to the UK, said the Home Office told him to apply for visas in Lviv - even though the centre has shut. He told The Daily Telegraph: Basically the Home Office staff don't have the same information as the people do on the ground.' Enver Solomon, of the Refugee Council charity, told MPs the Government was placing paperwork over people'. Comment - Page 20   WE DROVE 1,600 MILES... THEN UK TURNED US AWAY A UKRAINIAN mother and daughter who drove 1,600miles from Kyiv were turned away in Calais by UK border staff who shrugged' as they pleaded to be let through as refugees. Alena Semenova, 22, and Tetyana Tsybanyuk, 40, had bought a ticket on an Irish Ferries sailing to Dover and had passed the French border, but were stopped by seemingly indifferent British officials who detained them like criminals' because they did not have visas. Miss Semenova, a former medical student trying to reach her godparents in Glasbury, Powys, said: We did not understand what was happening, why we were detained as criminals. But the border guard officer shrugged her shoulders and said that they would not let us through without a visa.' They then had to drive 180 miles to Paris where they are hoping to gain visas. But this will only happen if the Government eases restrictions for Ukrainians without relatives in Britain. Her godfather, Graham Blackledge, a chiropodist whose wife Alla is also from Kyiv, said: Let them come over, house them, feed them, look after them. And then if you want to start processing them, but in the first instance help. And to accuse those seeking sanctuary in Britain of perhaps being Russian spies trying to infiltrate the UK, you should be ashamed of yourself.' At the Polish processing centre, Natalia Honcharyk, a 28-year-old marketing executive from Kyiv, said: It's not like we are going on holiday. We only want to get to Britain to seek safety there.' She and her 37-year-old sister, Viktoriia Kudlysheva, a civil servant, hope to stay with a cousin in Bristol. We are unsure if our application will be accepted here because we had originally booked an appointment in Lviv,' Viktoriia said.   THE TORTUOUS PROCESS FOR GAINING ENTRY Ukrainian refugees hoping to come to the UK must go through the following painstaking process under the Government's Family Visa Scheme: Create an online account on the Home Office website and fill in a detailed application form. Upload proof their qualifying family member has permanent residence status in Britain, such as a copy of the Home Office vignette in their family member's passport. Upload proof they had been living in Ukraine before January 1 this year. Provide evidence they are related to the qualifying family member in Britain, such as birth certificates or marriage certificates. If documents cannot be provided, applicants must explain why you are unable to do so'. Translate all above documents into English and upload them to the website. Book and attend an in-person appointment at a Home Office visa application centre in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova or France so officials can take biometrics - fingerprints and a facial scan. The booking system frequently crashes and there are reports the earliest slots available are in two weeks' time. Although normal visa requirements for a tuberculosis vaccination certificate have been waived, some applicants have mistakenly been asked to provide them. Wait while the application is decided by caseworkers in the UK and security checks are carried out. © Daily Mail","Tabloid",1,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Margaerita Plotnick was with her mother and teenage cousin when she was approached at a refugee reception centre by the stranger who offered to take her to the US. It was only when the suspicious 25-year-old waitress secretly checked US entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees that she discovered the stranger was lying. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday after travelling to Ireland, Margaerita said: 'I had a lucky escape. I could have been a victim of this predator.' Margaerita was approached at the Medyka crossing after 33 days of Russian bombardment and a shortage of food and water forced her to leave her home in Kharkiv. When she and her family members arrived at the Polish border, they were taken by bus to a sprawling industrial site on the outskirts of Przemysl, which has been converted into a reception centre for refugees. They were excited to be offered accommodation in the Irish city of Limerick after registering. 'We thought we were safe,' she said. But Margaerita was approached by 'George', a 44-year-old Russianspeaker with a US passport who told her he ran an import and export business in America. 'He was wearing a yellow jacket like the other volunteers and he had an official wristband which meant he had been vetted to provide transportation,' said Margaerita. 'He told me he was from the UN.' She said George's initially affable charm changed when she declined his offer. 'We refused but he wouldn't stop asking,' she said. Margaerita alerted a volunteer at a centre help desk, who challenged the stranger. 'George' was escorted out by security and has been banned from all humanitarian centres in Poland.

After widespread criticism of bureaucracy surrounding the UK's response, Lord Harrington said the Government's emergency routes will soon bring in 15,000 evacuees a week. The minister also confirmed that so far only hundreds of Ukrainians have arrived in Britain under the Homes for Ukraine programme. Some visa applicants fleeing the Russian invasion have been waiting weeks for a response. 'I want to get this process down to a reasonable amount of time,' said Lord Harrington. 'I am happy to say publicly that my target is 48 hours from when they download the appli- cation form to when they are given permission to travel.' Last week he told MPs that 'two or three days' would be a 'reasonable' ambition, but did not offer an official target at that stage. Lord Harrington told The Sunday Times how he has applied to be a sponsor himself, offering a London flat he owns with his fiancee, former Tory MP Jessica Lee. A government-backed scheme to match Ukrainian refugees with British families who have offered to open up their homes was finally launched on Friday. A charity oversees the pairing of evacuees with 'suitable' hosts, three weeks after Britons were first asked to volunteer their help. It means UK residents who have not managed to link up with Ukrainians by informal means - such as social media - can now apply to an officiallyendorsed programme.

The official website was overwhelmed just minutes after its launch - with 1,500 signing up inside an hour. And by 9.30pm last night more than 43,800 individuals and organisations had logged their support on the Homes for Ukraine site. In a further sign of British generosity, donations to the Daily Mail's appeal for Ukraine crisis victims reached an astonishing £7.2million yesterday. The Homes for Ukraine website crashed repeatedly at first but a government spokesman said experts were looking at the issue and were confident it would settle down quickly. We are seeing a high level of traffic to the website thanks to the enormous generosity of the British public,' the spokesman added last night. Communities Secretary Michael Gove launched the new refugee programme by praising the unfailingly compassionate' British people who have voiced their desperation to help Ukrainians fleeing Vladimir Putin's forces. In other developments: * UK defence sources said Putin's invaders could sustain full fighting capacity in Ukraine for only a further ten to 14 days'; * Russian forces let civilians escape the besieged port of Mariupol for the first time - but blocked an aid convoy; * A pregnant woman wounded when Russia attacked a maternity hospital in the city last week died along with her unborn baby; * Russia stepped up its assault on the suburbs of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, with airstrikes on an apartment block leaving one dead and six injured; * A senior Russian official, National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov, admitted the military campaign was struggling to achieve its aims due to Ukrainian resistance; * Moscow confirmed the first death of a spy from its feared military intelligence agency, the GRU, adding to a lengthening list of senior commanders killed; * In a bizarre online message, tech billionaire Elon Musk challenged Putin, a judo black belt, to man-to-man single combat'; * Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab visited the International Criminal Court in The Hague and said Britain was prepared to host convicted Russian war criminals; * Riot police were called in after squatters occupied a London mansion linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska; * Fellow sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich fled Tel Aviv hours after landing from Moscow as Israel warned it would not serve as a route to bypass sanctions'. The Homes for Ukraine programme will allow members of the public to give refugees rent-free rooms in their home for a minimum of six months. In return the Government will pay hosts £350 a month as a tax-free thank you'. Mr Gove also announced that hosts will require only light-touch' vetting, including a criminal records check. He told the Commons: The British people have already opened their hearts in so many ways, I'm hopeful that many will also be ready to open their homes and to help those fleeing persecution find peace, healing and the prospect of a brighter future. The scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home. There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can benefit from this scheme. The scheme will be open to all Ukrainian nationals and residents. They will be able to live and work in the United Kingdom for up to three years. They will have full and unrestricted access to benefits, health care, employment and other support.' Homes for Ukraine will initially allow hosts to sponsor known connections' for a visa to come to the UK. Initially, most refugees are likely to be housed in areas of the country where there are already a significant number of people of Ukrainian ancestry, Mr Gove said. But he added the scheme would rapidly expand to allow charities and faith and community groups to link Britons to the refugees. He admitted the scheme was not perfect' but had been designed to minimise bureaucracy and make the process as straightforward as possible. We don't believe we need to have full Disclosure and Barring Service checks. It is very often the case that very light-touch criminal checks will be sufficient,' Mr Gove told the Commons. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps yesterday confirmed that he would apply to host Ukrainian evacuees in his home. At the weekend Mr Gove also said he intended to take part. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it would be difficult for him to offer the time' to host refugees. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was unlikely to take any Ukrainian refugees into No 10 due to security concerns. Asked about Mr Johnson, who lives in the flat above No 11 Downing Street with his wife Carrie and two of his children, the PM's spokesman said: There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10.' Former health secretary Matt Hancock said he would be very happy to take in a refugee. I've been working with a Ukrainian family who have family relations in my constituency,' he told BBC Radio Suffolk. I'd be very happy to have a Ukrainian family in my home. I'm lucky to be able to do that, and I look forward to participating, whether in this scheme or helping a Ukrainian family through my constituency links.' d.barrett@dailymail.co.uk   © Daily Mail","Tabloid",1,"2022-03",1,"Aid"

Aides to the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William are understood to be examining a range of 'practical measures', including the possibility of jobs and training courses, as well as providing accommodation. Charles is said to be looking at finding spaces on his Dumfries House estate in Ayrshire as well as sites across his Duchy of Cornwall holdings, which include a number of holiday homes. The Queen's Balmoral estate on Royal Deeside and Sandringham in Norfolk, which are both private and not funded by the taxpayer, could also provide space in holiday-rental cottages and offer temporary tourism-related and hospitality jobs. A source told The Mail on Sunday: 'All the households are united in this - the Queen, Charles and William - with all three agreed that they should find a practical way to help Ukrainian refugees. 'It means looking at accommodation options in England, including the Duchy of Cornwall, where Charles has a lot of holiday homes, and Scotland, where he has Dumfries House and the Queen has Balmoral estate.' The Queen, Charles and his wife Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have all donated to a coalition of 15 British charities working on the Disasters Emergency Committee Ukraine appeal. Charles and William have also spoken out in support of Ukrainians resisting Russian aggression, but it is understood they are keen to do more as Britons prepare to welcome refugees under the Government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. An insider at Dumfries House said the Prince's Foundation, a charity that manages the 2,000-acre estate, was actively looking at how it could help Ukrainians with work, courses and accommodation. The estate's education centre regularly offers training courses in skills from horticulture and sustainable farm practices to engineering. A Royal spokesman last night said: 'The Royal Household is looking at a number of ways to offer practical help and support.' The royal family in Belgium last week said it would host three families of Ukrainian refugees. Last year, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde housed some of those who lost their homes in flooding. Scottish Land & Estates (SLE), a body that represents country estates north of the border, last week said it had received pledges to provide help from more than 40 landowners. It is understood that SLE approached Balmoral, the Queen's private 50,000-acre estate, which will open to the public next month and is currently advertising for waiting and housekeeping staff as well as 'visitor enterprise assistants' with accommodation provided. William and Kate have also offered to use their Royal Foundation to provide support for Ukrainians with mental health problems after the horrors they have witnessed. Dee Ward, Vice Chair at SLE, said: 'As estates are rural businesses, many are in the fortunate position of being able to offer not just accommodation but also employment opportunities. 'There will be many Ukrainian people with experience and talent in farming, food production and hospitality that can be of real value to our rural communities. We are under no illusion how difficult it will be for Ukrainians coming here, but we want to work with the Scottish and UK governments to provide opportunities for individuals and families wherever we can.'

There is also the possibility that Ukrainian refugees will have to contribute towards monthly bills in pledged accommodation and social welfare supports may be time limited. The Government is said to be worried that the State is reaching its limit in housing Ukrainian refugees as many more than expected arrive here. There are also concerns that many hotel contracts will run out at the end of the year putting even more strain on the system. More than 11,000 people are in the direct provision system - with a small number for longer than seven years.

Gardai confirmed that a technical exam will be carried out at the scene of an old convent in Lanesboro, Co Longford, where a fire took place on Tuesday. In a statement, the Department of Integration confirmed that the property had been offered for use as Ukrainian refugee accommodation and had been undergoing renovation. Joe Flaherty, Fianna Fail TD for Longford-Westmeath, told the Irish Mirror the owners have now withdrawn their offer. He said that it had been offered for two years, adding: ""It was at the owners' instigation that the contract was terminated. ""I would be deeply troubled by the fire. I can appreciate that anything like this causes a certain amount of concern in a local community. ""I think What happened in Lanesboro has been, probably, fuelled by what's happening in other parts of the country. ""Four hundred metres away from this location there is an old nursing home and 80 odd Ukrainians have been living there for more than six months now with no issue and [they have] accumulated relatively well into the local community.

""It could have been a tragedy, there are commercial businesses alongside it, there are residential houses on the other side. It could have been an absolute disaster."" Mr Flaherty said that the fire happened against a ""backdrop"" of very little communication from the Department of Integration about the property. He said that he has asked for clarification on several sites across Longford linked to asylum or refugee accommodation and has not had a response.

The refugee students aged 15 to 21, like the lions, were saved from Russian warmonger Vladimir Putin's rockets. Listening to the beasts at Yorkshire Wildlife Park, Yelizoete Terletsko, 18, said: ""I was really upset they had to leave our home in Ukraine, the same as me. But I'm really grateful that people helped them like they did me and we are all in a safe place now."" Later she squealed in delight as a giraffe grabbed a branch from her and said: ""They're so strong."" Yelizoete recalled her sister phoning her to say the war had started. The school for the blind in the northern city of Kharkiv was one of the first buildings to be bombed. The students, many of whom are orphans, were evacuated to Poland a day before it was virtually destroyed. Yelizoete said: ""I thought 'how can there be war in the 21st century? How can that happen? When the bombing began I was worried I wouldn't survive. ""Because we're blind we can hear differently. You can hear more and you feel the noises in your body. Rats ""It was a horrible experience and I hope it all finishes soon because I never want to hear the bombs again."" Initially, the 70-year-old headmaster decided everyone should hide in the school's basement, with staff securing the school's windows with mattresses to protect against rocket attacks. The students were traumatised by both the rats in the basement, and the rocket attacks outside. Deputy head teacher Marzena Bialas said: ""They're really excited about the lions in Yorkshire. They didn't know they had been shipped over to the UK. When we told them about it they googled the Mirror. They also phoned their old head teacher to tell him they were visiting lions from Ukraine."" The head teacher from the Polish school, Violetta Trzcina, said the 14 students had now been with them for two years. She said: ""We can't thank everyone enough for this trip as it is helping not only kids but blind adults to forget about the tragic situation in Ukraine."" The students have been supported by the Duchess of York, who helped to arrange the wildlife visit and the Thomas Pocklington Trust and the RNIB who funded their trip to the UK. Sarah, Duchess of York told the Mirror she had met the students a number of times and it was ""wonderful"" they'd been able to visit Yorkshire. She said: ""I hope the visit brings smiles to their faces - for me the smile of a child has always been the most important thing. ""They have been through unimagi- n a b l e trauma, separated from their families, broken apart by the dreadful Russian invasion. It is just the most appalling situation. ""I first met the group in Poland at the onset of the war, where my charity has worked for many years. I was humbled to hear their story of survival and determination, and we have remained in touch ever since. It is an honour for me to call them my friends."" The group were also taken behind the scenes at the Park, near Doncaster, and listened to some of the ""most vocal mammals on the planet"", the sea lions. Then they had a private audience in the lion enclosure where Aysa and her three cubs, Santa, Emi and Teddi, are settling in. The big cats roared as the youngsters were told about their journey by the ranger. The small pride arrived last week thanks to help from the park's Wildlife Foundation who funded the trip. Pregnant Aysa was first moved from a private zoo in Donetsk, Ukraine, to the country's capital Kyiv. She gave birth to the cubs there, and the family went to Poznan in Poland, where they were safe but unable to see the sky for nine months. After crossing six countries and travelling more than 2,000 miles they finally arrived at their safe haven in Auckley last Thursday. Within days, they had settled so much, the rangers felt able to remove the steel panel between their mum's pen and theirs so they are now separated by see-through mesh. The rangers say all have been head rubbing and ""showing really positive signs"", with Emi lying next to her mum by the mesh all day long. As we watch, Emi won't leave the mesh, and appears to be trying to touch her mum with her paw resting in the space between the pens. HORRIBLE The rangers are planning to let them have access into an area which overlooks their huge eight acre enclosure, where they will live eventually. As they roared at the visitors, Bohdan Ustiianskyi, 18, told us: ""I feel emotional that I can be here. I never dreamed I would travel so much. ""It was a big surprise to find out about the lions from Ukraine, it's similar to our story."" He told how he woke to hear shouting about the war starting and a tank parked outside their school. They did not know if it was Ukrainian or Russian. He said: ""It was horrible. It was an old building and the walls were shaking, the bombing was so close to us in the centre of Kharkiv. ""We stayed in the basement only going upstairs to brush our teeth. I was scared. We didn't understand what was going on because we could not see it.

The Government has now announced its backing for schemes all over the country. The response has been huge, even before the formal announcement. My own small experience confirms the enthusiasm. On BBC Any Questions? on Friday night, I mentioned that, in our rural Sussex parish, the parochial church councils were starting to coordinate a local contribution. Since then, my wife - in her role as churchwarden - and I have had numerous inquiries. Yesterday, I spoke to our dynamic, new and young rector (you don't find so many of them in the English countryside), the Rev Thomas Pelham. He confirmed the situation. With the encouragement of the bishops of the Chichester diocese, parishes are signing up with a national charity called the Sanctuary Foundation. The type of help to be offered is intended to cover a broad range. At the lower end of commitment, it would mean things like picking people up from airports. It would also run to helping with food, offering friendship etc. At the high end, it would involve accommodation. The charity accepts direct, individual offers of help as well as group offers such as that from our parish. Looking at the Sanctuary Foundation's website, I am impressed that it is honest enough to include a testimonial from a volunteer who warns how tricky it can be if you take a refugee into your home. The example cited is refugees who came from professional backgrounds and did not fit the traditional image of a starving peasant grateful for a crust. They were sophisticated people looking for a good job. Their hosts found it difficult to match their hopes. The message of such warnings is that it is wonderful so many people want to help, but any offer must be built to last - the human equivalent of the slogan that a pet is for life, not just for Christmas. Offer it only if you understand what it involves. . The logic of putting refugees in real homes not grim hostels also suggests letting them get real jobs, not forcing them to live on handouts. So it is out of kilter that the Home Office is currently trying to increase the wage in the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme to the equivalent of £25,500 a year just when Ukrainians are arriving. It is too much for employers, who are already committed to upping their rate to £9.50 an hour from next month. Put it higher still and the jobs dry up. . I have seen some complaint that more people are coming forward for Ukrainians than did for Middle Eastern refugees. This shows prejudice against non-Europeans, it is alleged. This is probably unfair. Our sense of responsibility for those in such a plight in our own continent is natural. We rightly feel some collective guilt for not acting earlier and not hitting hard enough at Putin. There is also a difference in the nature of those arriving. Many Middle Eastern and African refugees in recent years have been young men without families. This has made it likelier they will include extremists and criminals. Religion is, unfortunately, relevant. The ferment in Islam does mean that jihadists infiltrate the movement of peoples. In the Ukrainian case, most refugees are women and children. Their men stay behind to www.fight.No doubt we must watch out for organised criminal gangs and a few Russian undercover agents, but I don't think we need worry that the Orthodox Church of Ukraine or the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church contain militants who mean harm to Britain. . Yet again, tomorrow, the House of Lords is to debate ""assisted dying"". (The more accurate phrase is ""assisted suicide"": this is not about the existing help to make death less painful.) The form this time is a backbench amendment to the Health and Care Bill telling the Government to draft an assisted dying Bill. This is unconstitutional because it undermines the Government's right to decide what legislation it introduces. Besides, assisted suicide is a question for the criminal law, not a Bill about healthcare. There is an irony here. The Health and Care Bill is the first to make palliative care a core purpose of the National Health Service, a welcome development. The assisted dying amendment would go against the spirit of this change. Three quarters of doctors involved in palliative medicine resist any involvement in assisted dying procedures. They know that palliative care addresses, much more humanely and professionally, the agony and indignity which can accompany the approach of death. . Like hundreds of thousands, our family wishes to fly the Ukrainian flag. A large one already flutters bravely in the public gardens, named after the present Queen's Coronation, in our village. The problem, however, is sourcing. There are plenty of such flags to be had, but most seem to be made in China, which in effect supports the Russian invasion. A false flag, you might almost say. I am glad to report my wife found one made in Taiwan, and it has just arrived; but surely there is an opening here for an enterprising British flag producer, perhaps in aid of the refugees. read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion","Broadsheet",1,"2022-03",1,"Aid"

He was sacked after management concluded his ""egregious"" failings in the role had caused damage to the company's reputation. An employment tribunal heard that last November Mr Miller was sent an email by a local councillor that detailed a community meeting which 12 Ukrainians staying at one of the resort's hotels - the Strathspey Hotel - had attended. ""The forwarded email set out that the refugees had told harrowing stories of living conditions in the Strathspey Hotel and provided photographs and video to back up concerns,"" the tribunal heard.

Eleven days after the email was sent, Mr Miller faced a disciplinary hearing. Among the accusations he faced was a claim that he had failed to ""properly oversee arrangements at Strathspey Hotel for a group of Ukrainian refugees placed with us"" and that he had responded without talking to Macdonald Hotel managers. His boss, Natalya Macholla, upheld four allegations and dismissed him without notice last December, the hearing was told. He appealed unsuccessfully against the management's findings and then sued the company for unfair dismissal, but his case was thrown out after the tribunal concluded that he was guilty of ""non-observance"" of his duties. However, his case was thrown out after the tribunal concluded that as the most senior person on site he was accountable for what had gone wrong.

By Friday morning, the medical student was directing a chaotic throng of arrivals inside Berlin's main station, as Germany's ""welcome culture"" returned to the foreground. The WhatsApp group now has almost 8,000 volunteers and is central to efforts to provide refugees with temporary accommodation, food and clothes. ""I've been working 10 hours every day this week, and I've got to work shifts at the clinic at night,"" said the 27-year-old with Somali roots in an upbeat tone. ""But we are learning what the people who come here need."" Her mobile phone buzzes every few seconds with new messages, some of them from Ukraine, others from more Berliners who want to help. Behind her back, another volunteer coordinator shouts into a megaphone: ""If you speak Russian or Ukrainian, stay. If you don't, please come back tonight."" Scenes at Berlin's central station mirror those from the summer of 2015, when large parts of German civic society rallied to aid asylum seekers arriving from Syria. In terms of sheer numbers, however, the challenge is starker: at the height of the influx of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, authorities in Berlin had to coordinate shelter for about 700 people and struggled, temporarily repurposing sports halls. This Thursday alone, 6,500 refugees arrived in the city by train, according to Berlin's senator for social affairs. In each of the previous two days more than 1,000 people have arrived. Operator Deutsche Bahn, which has been handing out free travel tickets to refugees from Ukraine, says it has doubled its number of direct trains to the Polish border. ""We have to prepare for the fact that the largest movement of refugees since the end of the second world war is headed for Europe,"" said senator Katja Kipping. ""What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg."" The hope in Germany's administrative apparatus is that relaxed visa rules will avoid bottleneck situations: since 2017, Ukrainians with biometric passports have been able to travel to the Schengen zone and stay for 90 days out of every 180 without needing a visa. Sixteen-year-old Viktor Levchenko arrived at Berlin central station on Friday morning, with his mother and cousin, having left Kyiv 48 hours before. Carrying a backpack each and a paper bag with basic supplies such as flour, toilet rolls and soap given to them by volunteers, they waited on the cold ground floor of the station for a Berlin-based Ukrainian friend to pick them up and host them for a few days. ""We are working out what to do,"" Levchenko said. ""For now, we must stay in Germany. But afterwards, we must go back."" After arriving in Berlin, they called his aunt and uncle who had stayed behind in Kyiv to serve in the military. As they were speaking over the phone, they could hear air-raid sirens in the background. Even before Vladimir Putin's army started its incursion on to Ukrainian soil last week, asylum applications in Germany had risen to a four-year high in 2021, following a drop during the first year of the pandemic. As shelters in the capital were close to full capacity at the start of the year, the senate proposed renting empty hotels and hostels on an ad hoc basis. On Friday, Kipping said the city was planning to erect a tent outside the central station that would provide temporary resting places and sanitary facilities to those arriving from Ukraine before they were transported by shuttle buses to shelters in Berlin or nearby cities like Leipzig. But until now, the brunt of the aid effort has been facilitated by volunteers, such as Mirjam König, who was waiting by the side of arrival point at Hauptbahnhof with her toddler son on her arm. A cardboard sign rested on the buggy next to her, saying: ""One room for woman with 1/2 children."" König said she had posted her offer of a room on a volunteering website three days earlier but did not get a response. ""Maybe it's more practical this way,"" she said, while bouncing her son in her arms. ""I wanted to exhaust all my options."" ""If something like this happened to me, I would hope there will be people offering me their help too.

The half-sisters had spent the first years of their lives together in the southern Ukrainian village of Nikolaev, leaning on each other as they grew up with only an absentee mother to care for them. Family problems left them separated soon after; five-year-old Angelika was sent to live with an aunt and Tatyana, six, with a grandmother before ending up in state care. They begged to be kept together, recalled Tatyana Kluge García, 25. ""But economically it was impossible, Angelika's aunt couldn't afford to take us both in."" At the age of eight, Tatyana was adopted by a family in the Spanish city of Girona, near Barcelona, trading her arduous beginning for a new family, country and slate of languages. Even as her command of Ukrainian faded, her sister remained constantly in her thoughts. ""I always said that I would go to Ukraine and find her,"" said Tatyana. As a teenager she scoured social media for any trace of her sister, even downloading the Russian social network VK at one point. More than 2,000 miles away in Ukraine, Angelika was doing the same. When she stumbled across a Facebook profile in 2019 that showed a beaming young woman in Spain, she was certain she had found Tatyana. ""I just knew it was my sister."" Within weeks the two were chatting constantly online, pushing past language and cultural barriers. ""It was like a girlfriend that you're getting to know but really it's your sister and you want to share your life with her,"" said Tatyana. Excitedly they made plans to meet up in Spain, only to have the possibility derailed by the pandemic. In February, as Russian troops amassed on the border of Ukraine, Tatyana made a frantic call to Angelika. ""I told her that here they're saying that there's going to be a war,"" she said. Angelika sought to temper her sister's fears. ""I was hoping all of this would blow over and everything would be fine,"" she said. ""But it just got worse and worse."" She and her fiance left their home in Nova Odesa, heading to a nearby village where her cousin had converted his basement into a makeshift shelter. As the sound of bombings cracked in the distance, they would dart into the basement. ""Tatyana was texting me every day, saying pack up, we're all waiting for you, we're worried,"" she said. Angelika canvassed those around her, but her loved ones were determined to stay. ""It was a very difficult decision because I didn't want to leave my family,"" she said. ""I was also very worried about how I was going to get there on my own - it was a long way."" In the end it was a message from Tatyana's mother, reinforcing that she would be safe in Spain, that convinced Angelika. She set off for the Polish border in a vehicle with other Ukrainians looking to leave, steeling herself for the worst. ""I was terrified we would be detained or that there would be an air alert,"" said Angelika. Her anxiety was laced with nervousness for what lay ahead: ""The whole way I was thinking about what it would be like to see my sister and whether she would accept me,"" she said. From her home in Girona, Tatyana tracked Angelika's every step. She bought her a plane ticket from Warsaw, battling spotty mobile coverage and language barriers to make sure her sister made it on to the flight. ""I was going crazy,"" said Tatyana. ""She had never been on a plane, she didn't know how to check in or check her baggage."" The days of anxiety melted away as soon as she spotted her sister. ""I had always wondered what that moment would be like,"" said Tatyana. ""You think: 'Maybe I'll be in shock, maybe I won't know what to say, maybe I'll cry.' But in the end I just couldn't believe it was happening."" In the month since Angelika's arrival in Spain, the sisters have carved out a comfortable coexistence in Tatyana's apartment, using hand gestures, a handful of shared vocabulary and a lot of Google Translate to communicate. The ease of their interactions belies their decades apart; Angelika, who hates carrying a handbag, stuffs her phone and charger into her older sister's purse whenever they leave the house, while the two trade quiet nods of affirmation as they delve into the details of their past. ""There are days that go by and I'm looking at her and I still can't believe it,"" said Tatyana. ""I just think: 'You're here.'"" Echoing the uncertainty facing many of the 135,000 Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Spain in recent months, neither sister knows what comes next: whether Angelika will eventually return to her fiance, job and family in Ukraine, or seek to bring them to Spain and start over. ""Since we were little we've been dreaming of seeing each other again, but we would never have imagined that it would be because of a war,"" said Tatyana. For Angelika, being back with her sister was a ""wonderful, unbelievable feeling"". The joy, however, was rivalled by the angst of leaving her loved ones in a country at war.  ""I just can't stop thinking about it.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-05",1,"Migration"

Since the end of February, at least 480 Ukrainian families with children and 180 single adults have applied to councils for help with homelessness. Despite the government insisting that the Homes for Ukraine and family visa schemes would ensure that refugees had housing, both are leaving people struggling when arrangements break down. The data exposes the cracks already appearing in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, with 145 placements having ended in homelessness by 3 June. Of these, 90 ended because the arrangement broke down and a further 55 never got off the ground properly because the accommodation was unavailable or unsuitable on arrival. Lauren Scott, executive director of Refugees at Home, said: “We are frustrated and saddened but not surprised to see placements start to break down. Expecting vulnerable, traumatised refugees to rely on the goodwill of strangers they have met on Facebook was always a risk. “We urgently need a joined-up national fallback plan to help families whose placements go wrong. Across the country there is no consistent approach to rematching guests with new hosts, no standard way for Ukrainians to change their visa sponsors, and no single mechanism for moving funding from one host to another.” Many local authorities are treating Ukrainian families as homeless rather than attempting to rematch them with new hosts, leaving them in hostels and hotels, just as happened with Afghan refugees. Of the 145 failed Homes for Ukraine placements, only 20 were rematched with a new host. Scott said: “It is a nightmare situation – the very one that we had hoped to avoid.” Anna, 37, fled Kyiv with her husband and their three-year-old son when war broke out. They came to Britain at the end of March after matching with a family of four who lived in a large house in Northampton. After initially being welcoming, their hosts became less enthusiastic within a few weeks. “We didn’t understand what was happening because they changed their mood very quickly,” Anna said. Anna and her family were moved into an annexe. The host said he wanted a key to it and they agreed as long as he warned them before going in, but shortly afterwards he called the council to say he wanted to terminate his sponsorship. “They didn’t explain anything to us,” Anna said. “They were not ready to share their house. They tried to get rid of us as soon as possible.” Her family were put up in a Travelodge for several days by the council, sharing one room with no cooking facilities. They had no idea where to go. “We were desperate and felt we didn’t have any other options than to go back to Ukraine,” Anna said. Finally, after trawling the internet, they found Refugees at Home, who helped place them with another family. They are still scarred from the experience. “We lost our home in Ukraine, and when we came here we thought that we were safe, but actually we weren’t and we lost our home a second time.” The family visa scheme, which has been running the longest, accounted for 455 homeless applications. In many cases, families desperate to get their relatives out of Ukraine applied for visas but never had room for them to stay. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said: “It is worrying to see that desperate Ukrainian families who have fled war, endured trauma and heartbreak, arriving here, entrusting their safety in our hands, to have been left to fall into homelessness. “Ukrainian families arriving here need a warm welcome, safe housing and benefits, emotional support, and connection. We’re concerned that Ukrainians arriving on family visas are running into problems as not all relatives will have the space or the resources to support their family members – which is why there needs to be the same level of funding available to them and local councils as is provided under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.” Lisa Nandy MP, shadow levelling up and housing secretary, said: “It is utterly shameful that families that have fled Putin’s brutal war have found themselves homeless here in the UK. “The British people showed amazing generosity in stepping up in their thousands to provide the care and sanctuary that these people – many of them families with young children – needed and deserved in such awful circumstances. “But the government has failed miserably to play its part. Ministers were warned about the risk of refugees becoming homeless on the day they launched the sponsorship scheme, but they were more interested in grandstanding in television studios than doing their jobs to protect vulnerable people. “The government must urgently set out a plan to support councils to find safe homes for these families.” Cllr David Renard, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: “Currently, councils receive no data on, or funding for, people who are coming under the family visa scheme. Some of those families present as homeless once they have arrived, but we are asking that they should be able to be rematched with a sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. “Urgent work is needed on how councils can work with government and the community, faith and voluntary sector so those offering their homes can be quickly matched with a family in need.” A government spokesperson said: “More than 77,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK since Putin’s invasion and all arrivals have access to benefits and public services, as well as the right to work or study, from the day they arrive. “The overwhelming majority of people are settling in well, but in the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. Councils also have access to a rematching service to find a new sponsor in cases under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-06",0,"Conditions"

Applicants to host Ukrainian refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have expressed concern that some refugees are being forced to remain in the conflict zone while UK visas are processed. A Conservative councillor resigned from the party at the weekend after being shocked at the red tape surrounding the UK's Ukraine visa system, which she said reflected the government's ""hostile"" and ""xenophobic"" approach to refugees. Samantha Flower has applied to sponsor a 17-year-old Ukrainian boy to live with her family in Buxton, Derbyshire, but said she had been met by delays and bureaucracy. The child has been forced to remain in Ukraine while the paperwork is processed. ""If he doesn't make it out alive, it's because the red tape prevented it,"" she said. Her unease was reflected by the statement from the heads of the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam who warned that the visa system was ""causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians"". ""Those who want to come to the UK are having to navigate a complex web of bureaucratic paperwork to get visas, leaving them facing protracted delays without any information about the status of their application,"" the charity heads wrote in a letter published on Monday in the Times. ""The government must urgently review the use of visas and waive them as an immediate short-term measure, as has been done by the EU, and look to introduce a simplified emergency humanitarian visa process."" Flower, a councillor on High Peak borough council, has signed up to the UK's Home for Ukraine scheme , where strangers act as hosts, but has not yet been approved. Only 1,000 of the 25,000 completed applications have been approved so far. The boy and his stepmother and father, both lawyers, fled their home in Kyiv when Russia invaded. They arranged for the teenager to travel to the UK after contacting Flower online, where the councillor had offered her home. However, the boy has only a domestic Ukrainian passport and not the international passport required by the UK as part of its visa process. The boy's family have had to stay in Ukraine and wait for the correct paperwork - a process they have been told could take weeks. ""They're having to wait for the passport to be completed,"" said Flower. ""They had a shell land near their home five or six days ago. They don't know from one day to the other what's going to happen."" She said the government's complex visa system for Ukrainians reflected its ""hostile"" approach to all refugees, adding: ""We're tipping towards being quite far right and it's not the party that I joined."" More than 3.9 million refugees have left Ukraine in the past month, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, more than 2.2 million of whom have ended up in Poland. The Home Office has granted 21,600 visas to Ukrainians who are hoping to join relatives in Britain under the Ukraine Family scheme. The Department for Levelling Up, which is handling the parallel Homes for Ukraine scheme, for people who do not have family in the UK, has not yet released any figures about the number of visas granted. However, refugee hosting charities say the numbers of people coming through this scheme are so far ""tiny"". Lauren Scott, director of hosting charity Refugees at Home, said: ""We have been told anecdotally that the delay is largely down to the onerous visa application process, which is frustrating for our hosts and must be soul-destroying for guests. It is creating a huge bottleneck. So far we only know of three sponsorship visas granted to potential guests, and that's all to one family."" An opinion poll released on Sunday by Savanta ComRes indicated that 54% of people in the UK support a no-visa policy, and would like to allow an unlimited number of Ukrainians who are fleeing the Russian invasion to come to the UK. Despite concerns over the slowness of the process for granting visas to Ukrainian refugees, organisations working to resettle Afghan refugees who were airlifted from Kabul last August have asked the Homes for Ukraine scheme to be extended to allow households also to host Afghan families. In a letter to Michael Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, 50 signatories - including the head of the Refugee Council and former Conservative ministers Robert Buckland, Damian Green, Johnny Mercer and Caroline Nokes - called on the government to permit some of the 12,000 Afghans who are still being accommodated in hotels to be hosted in residential homes.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Even so, it was the male Russian officer ordering her to take off her blouse for an inspection that she found the worst indignity of the ordeal fleeing her home in Mariupol, Ukraine. “Bruises on the shoulders could mean you’re a sniper,” Olena explains from a cafe in Tbilisi, Georgia. She was horrified. “I told him, I’m turning 60 years old this August. How could I be a sniper?” The officer didn’t seem to care. “I’m not wearing my glasses anyway,” he told her. “Take your top off now.” Stories like Olena’s from a filtration camp in Nikolske, a town in the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic (DNR), are common among the growing number of Ukrainian refugees now in Georgia. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainians have entered Georgia, many arriving from Russia through Georgia’s northern Kazbegi mountain border. Unable to flee Russian-occupied cities such as Mariupol and Kherson westward into Ukrainian-held territory, many Ukrainians are left with a terrible dilemma: stay in your besieged city, or flee to the country that has destroyed your home. To enter Russia, many Ukrainians are forced through so-called filtration, a process during which they are photographed, interrogated, their fingerprints taken, and the contents of their phones scrutinised. Men are ordered to strip to their underwear, their bodies searched for tattoos that could reveal a link to Ukrainian nationalist groups. Everyone is questioned on whether they or anyone they know has served in the Ukrainian army. During Olena’s interrogation, she recalled how a guard questioning a man at the next table found a keyring bearing the image of the Ukrainian coat of arms. Four guards then beat the man savagely with batons and kicks to the head before throwing him outside in sub-zero temperatures without a coat or hat. Filtration camps have been set up across towns and villages mostly concentrated in the DNR, including Novoazovsk, Mangush, Bezimenne and Nikolske. Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol by bus often arrive at the filtration camps unknowingly, having been told they would be taken to Ukrainian-held cities instead. After arrival, they are usually not allowed to leave the town. Filtration usually ends in one of two ways: either you “pass” the interrogation and are handed a small, stamped piece of paper with the date of your filtration and the signature of the supervising officer, or you will be detained for further questioning. The “camps” occupy schools, cultural centres, sports halls and other public buildings. Conditions are often abject and the camps are poorly organised. People like Olena, who was travelling with her 65-year-old sister Tamara and Tamara’s 70-year-old husband and like others interviewed would not give her full name, slept first on the floor, then on a cardboard box. For the first few days there was one meal a day offered by the canteen. Then the Russians closed the canteen altogether and told them to find their own food. For Maksym and Iulia, from Mariupol, filtration was also a lengthy ordeal, though they were lucky to have been offered a house to stay in nearby that belonged to one of Maksym’s classmates. They spent almost a month waiting to be filtered in Mangush. “Our number in the queue was 347,” Maksym says. “You go in and ask what the number is today, and you realise the number only went down by two or three. Why was it so slow? The process itself takes around 30 minutes.” It was only after Maksym told a military pharmacist that they were running low on insulin for Iulia’s diabetes that their wait was expedited and they were filtered that afternoon. Waiting in a corridor, they saw a man in Ukrainian army fatigues being questioned on his knees, his hands tied behind his back. Others report a shorter wait time, with some Ukrainians spending only a day or two at the camps before filtration and onward travel to Russia. One 29-year-old couple, Igor and Valentina from Mariupol, report being filtered within six hours of arriving in Nikolske. “The fact my wife was nine months pregnant at the time and we had to get to a hospital as soon as possible probably helped speed things along,” Igor says. You have to tell them you want to stay and make a life in Russia, then they’ll leave you alone  Maksym  Ukrainians who subsequently escaped to Georgia have avoided the reportedly widespread forced deportations to Russian cities. One woman, Zhanna, told of how her family slipped out of a back door of a filtration centre unnoticed after overhearing an officer say that she, her husband and their young son would be deported to a Russian island near Japan. With only migration cards, not filtration papers, Zhanna and her family travelled by bus from Novoazovsk to Russia’s Taganrog. From Taganrog, they travelled by train to Vladikavkaz, and crossed into Georgia in a minivan through the border at Kazbegi. Others say that informing officers of concrete plans to go to a specific Russian city was enough for them to be allowed to make their own way to Russia, and then onwards to Georgia. “You have to tell them you want to stay and make a life in Russia, then they’ll leave you alone,” Maksym says. Most of the buses taking filtered Ukrainians from the DNR to Russia terminate at Taganrog. There, most buy bus or train tickets to Rostov-on-Don, from where they can organise onward transport. Those who come to Georgia travel south to Vladikavkaz before crossing over into Georgia through the mountain border. Even once they reach the Russian border, their exit is not guaranteed. Men are routinely taken out of the queue and interrogated, their phones examined. One man, Petya, reported being forced to pay the Russian border guards a bribe in exchange for an exit stamp. Many of the Ukrainians now in Tbilisi are biding their time until they can return home to Ukraine. “My goddaughter is still in Mariupol and sent me photos with crosses stuck into the ground everywhere. The graves are even in our courtyards,” Olena says. “I want to go home, but that means somewhere in Ukraine not occupied by Russians.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-06",0,"Conditions"

After criticism of the government's strategy and the bureaucratic delays facing Ukrainians with family ties to the UK, the British public will be asked to house refugees who have no family ties who would be eligible to work, access state benefits and public services. Government sources confirmed to the Guardian a report in the Daily Telegraph that as part of the widening of the sponsorship scheme, individuals, charities, businesses and community groups will be able to register to offer accommodation and employment via a hotline and webpage. Those offering a place to stay will be vetted and have to agree to house a refugee for a minimum period. A senior source in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities told the Guardian it was still considering the length of time for which people from Ukraine will be able to reside in the UK under the scheme. Details of the new ""sponsored"" humanitarian refugee route are expected to be revealed on Sunday with a full announcement on Monday by Michael Gove, the communities secretary. The refugees are expected to be recruited by the Home Office and will require visas in addition to biometric and security checks. It comes after Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced that the UK is to ease its rigid entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees , enabling those with passports to apply for entry online and to have to give biometric details only after they arrive in the UK. Many have gone to Calais to discover that they could not apply for visas there and were sent to other cities, while a number of UK consular offices had limited numbers of appointments. On Thursday, Patel told the Commons that from Tuesday, such appointments would no longer be needed for Ukrainian nationals with passports. They could apply remotely and would be told when they could travel. The home secretary said: ""In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are, and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain. ""This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports."" The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, welcomed the change, but castigated Patel for the system thus far, calling the treatment ""a total, total disgrace, bringing shame on to our country"".

A month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine 10 million people are believed to have left their homes, of whom 3.6 million are thought to have left for neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The Home Office has granted 18,600 visas to Ukrainian relatives of UK citizens, but there is rising frustration among those who have applied for visas under the government's two schemes - a family process and sponsorship programme - many of whom describe long delays without any way of knowing the status of their applications. Some refugees are stuck because their passports are believed to be locked up in a UK visa processing centre in Kyiv, which has now been closed due to the fighting. Others are worried because they are running out of money to pay hotel bills while they wait. Some families have been split because visas have been granted at different times. British national Nadiia Mackowiak, a London-based interpreter, is puzzled that visas have been granted to her father, sister and five-year-old niece, while her mother, Nadiia Pavlenko, is still waiting, 18 days after applying. ""My parents had to leave Kyiv after a missile hit their home; they saw their block burning and falling down. My mother is in very bad way, and is desperate to be with us here,"" she said. Her sister and niece have traveled to the UK, but her father and her mother, who ran a nursery in Kyiv until earlier this year, are still in Poland, staying with strangers who have given them a room. Her mother has twice been issued with UK visas previously. ""It's hard to understand what the problem is; it's too much bureaucracy. These people have fled a war."" Sandip Basu, a volunteer legal adviser with the Ukraine Advice Project, said he had advised one family of refugees who fled Ukraine in late February and applied for UK visas Budapest, but were forced to return to Ukraine while they waited two weeks for the visas to be processed ""It was clearly a dangerous measure but they could not afford to remain in Budapest,"" he said. Since 6 March, Michelle Potts has been in a rented one-bedroom flat in Bucharest with her 72-year-old mother-in-law Olga Selivanova, who uses a wheelchair, and her 12-year-old twin godchildren, who have left their village on the outskirts of Kyiv. ""We were told it would take five days to process their applications on 9 March, but we're still waiting. The children don't understand why it's taking so long. The UK visa system isn't fit for purpose at the best of times; it's certainly not fit for emergencies."" Tatiana Dembicka, 73, a retired university administrator from Kyiv, has been waiting since 4 March for her application to join her son, Eugene, a British citizen in the UK. Her case was raised with the home secretary and with the minister for refugees Lord Harrington by her son's MP Lucy Frazer, and she was told that a decision had been made on Tuesday, however her family was still waiting on Thursday for an emailing explaining what the decision was. ""I can't see why there is such a delay between a decision and notification,"" her son-in-law Karl Dembicki said. ""We feel embarrassed by the government's lack of empathy."" Several people described technical and practical difficulties with the Homes for Ukraine application form. One man said the woman he was hoping to sponsor was living in an underground shelter in Kyiv, and unable to return to her flat to collect documents required for the form. ""It is nerve-racking. The situation in Kyiv is not great. Due to the lack of the required document, we're not sure what the outcome of the visa application will be, but we're hoping for the best,"" he said. Clare Birkbeck, who is studying for a masters, said she was one of a group of about 10 families in Saffron Walden, Suffolk, trying to host refugees; she hopes to host Katryn Zakharchuk 35 and her son Alexander Zakharchuk 15. ""It's a black hole of stress. Katryn and her son are sleeping on the floor of a room in Krakow, belonging to a very kind Polish man, with six people, unable to access funds from their Ukrainian bank. We've had no further communication since submitting the form; you just have to wait. They are desperate and I'm unable to help because of the shambolic system."" Lucy Ward, a writer, said she had spent over seven hours grappling with forms to sponsor two mothers and two children over the weekend. ""There are a lot of baffled people; I speak Russian and I'm used to filling in visa forms, but I still found it confusing,"" she said, adding that there was a lot of pressure on hosts to make it work. ""It's so devolved. It's like a Victorian charity or a knit-your-own refugee scheme. I know it's been done quickly, but there has to be a better way."" The refugees are currently staying in a school sports hall in Poland. ""We've been told nothing about how long it might take,"" she said. Robina Qureshi, director of the refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said her charity was assisting 415 who were trying to be matched with UK sponsors. ""No one is getting visas from the families we are helping. Many families are living in war zones in Ukraine and won't leave until they know they can travel to the UK. The UK's visa approach to refugees is putting them at additional risk; under the refugee convention they don't need a visa,"" she said. The local government associations said it was still waiting to be given guidance on exactly how and when safety checks on sponsors' homes should be done.

Baker Matteo Cunsolo is making and selling ""peace bread"" in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag, with proceeds going to a charitable fund helping refugees who cross into Italy or who are remaining in Ukraine.  In addition, Cunsolo and area bakers have made 600 kilograms (1,325 pounds) of cookies to give out to young refugees. He plans to bring the sweets, along with a truck full of locally donated diapers, food, medicine and clothes, to the Ukrainian-Polish border next week. ""After running away from the bombs, perhaps travelling across forests by night in the cold, I think a cookie is like a little cuddle that can help bring a smile on a child's face,"" he said, standing in front of his industrial-sized oven at La Panetteria in Parabiago, near Milan.  Cunsolo said he got the idea to bake after watching a TV report about the reception Ukrainians were receiving at the Polish border: They were given something warm to drink and a piece of bread. ""When I heard the word bread I thought - 'OK I am a baker, what can I do to help?'"" He uses natural food coloring to make the bread: saffron to color the dough yellow, and an infusion made from the leaves of the blue butterfly pea flower, or clitoria ternatea, to get the blue. Once baked, he uses a butter-based spray and a ""PEACE"" stencil to decorate each loaf. ""It's a really important initiative,"" said customer Maria Pascolin as she shopped at the bakery.

And he announced plans to streamline the process of sanctioning individuals with links to Vladimir Putin , by removing the legal requirement for government lawyers to show that measures are ""appropriate"" before implementing them. But the changes fall well short of demands from Labour, who had called for a maximum 28-day delay before registers must be updated to identify the true owner of a property rather than a shell company. Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the government's tardiness in dealing with Russian ""dirty money"" in London has left the UK trailing behind the US and EU in imposing sanctions on Putin's cronies in response to the invasion of Ukraine.  Mr Johnson's decision to amend the Economic Crimes Bill before it comes before the Commons on Monday amounts to an admission that Britain's sanctions regime has been less able to respond swiftly than its American and European allies, who have already sanctioned hundreds of individuals. Legislation passed in the wake of Brexit to allow the UK to operate its own regime independent from the EU included measures requiring a watertight legal case to be established for each individual targeted - something which officials admit could take months. Removing the ""appropriateness"" test will allow the designation of groups, permitting the UK to align its sanctions lists with those imposed by Washington and Brussels. Those named could have travel bans imposed as well as asset freezes which prevent them from selling, renting, visiting or even repairing UK properties with a total estimated value of well over £1bn. Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab has even suggested the homes could be seized to house Ukrainian refugees. London has so far sanctioned only 15 oligarchs, including Alisher Usmanov, who has had financial links with Arsenal and Everton football clubs. Critics have warned that delays will allow billionaires who fear being put on the UK blacklist time to sell off assets and move their money abroad. Putin associate Roman Abramovich has announced plans to sell Chelsea FC, though there has been no official indication that he is being considered for sanctions. Meanwhile, ministers said that keeping a six-month grace period for property registration would help crack down on money while giving people with legitimate reasons to hold property in overseas entities time to comply. Mr Johnson said: ""The UK has led the way with the toughest package of sanctions against Putin's regime and we're bolstering this with new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster. ""We will ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil and close the net on corruption. They will have nowhere to hide."" But Mr Lammy responded: ""It is totally unacceptable that Putin-linked oligarchs who should have already faced sanctions are being allowed to move their money around because of government incompetence.   ""Ministers should have introduced the laws needed to work in lock-step with our allies and partners months ago, not be left sanctioning hundreds fewer individuals and entities than the EU and the US. ""We welcome the government's U-turn under pressure from Labour to tighten the law so we can move on more oligarchs tied to Putin's regime, but we must also move faster, acting against these individuals in âdays not months.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",0,"Policy"

The issues have been reported with the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows Britons to sponsor and host those fleeing the warzone in eastern Europe.  Disagreements between refugees and host families -including over costs and different lifestyles -have resulted in Ukrainians being turfed out, according toThe Guardian.  Others reportedly include conflicts caused by communication problems, a lack of proper house rules and personality clashes.  ""Our community is seeing these cases frequently and our perception is that they're increasing,"" Iryna Terlecky from the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain told The Guardian.  One case reported by the newspaper included a host that was strictly vegetarian and did not want meat in the house, which caused tension resulting in the host wanting the refugee family to leave as soon as possible. Councils have previously warned relationship breakdowns with hosts were leaving Ukrainians in the UK without a place to stay.  The Local Government Association found at least three dozen Ukrainian households had registered as homeless in the UK within the first two weeks of the Homes for Ukraine scheme opening. Reports of Ukrainians being kicked out of homes have sparked calls for a rematching system for those who have arrived on the Homes for Ukraine scheme but need to find a new host family.  A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these claims -more than 46,100 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well."" They added: ""There are stringent safeguarding measures in place for the Homes for Ukraine scheme and according to council data reports, very few of these sponsorships are breaking down.  ""Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor.""

Cabinet minister Michael Gove said he hoped ""tens of thousands"" would be able to use the route set to be opened up this week, as he announced that local authority areas would get £10,000 per Ukrainian refugee sponsored in their area. The minister for levelling up said he hoped individuals and community groups would be able to ""match"" with refugees using social media, adding that charities would help in the process. But opposition parties said the scheme - which will also provide £350 per month to Britons who provide homes to Ukrainian refugees - placed too much of the burden on the public and community groups. Labour cautioned that ""too many questions remain unanswered"" about the new scheme - and ridiculed its reliance on social media. Shadow levelling up minister Lisa Nandy told LBC: ""We're asking people to ask to take to social media at a time they're fleeing a war zone. This is a serious crisis - it's not an online dating situation."" Labour leader Sir KeirStarmerclaimed the government's handling of refugees fleeing Ukraine was ""far tooslow, fartoomean"" and had been ""an embarrassment for the United Kingdom"". Questioning the lack of detail in the sponsorship plan, Sir Keir told Sky News: ""What would comfort me more frankly is if I heard from Michael Gove that there were plans in place for the support that's actually going to be needed on arrival."" The Refugee Council said ministers were still putting too many ""bureaucratic hurdles"" in the way of those in danger. Chief executive Enver Solomon said the new scheme ""falls short"" of what is needed and would ""inevitably be restricted to those who are known to people in the UK"". Louise Calvey of Refugee Action said the government were ""tinkering at the margins"" and had not set out a ""well resourced"" programme that deals with the scale of the refugee crisis now enveloping Europe. Mr Gove told Sky News the public could register interest in housing a refugee on a newly launched website, and said he expects the first refugees making use of the route to come to the UK ""in a week's time"". Asked how sponsors and refugees were supposed the find each other, the minister told Sky News'Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the government believed they could try to form links on Instagram or Twitter. ""We know charities, and we are working with them, who are working to identify people on the ground, and helping to identify people here to create the matching process,"" he added. Sponsors will be expected to guarantee a minimum stay of six months - but will be encouraged to keep up the offer for as long as they can. Both those offering accommodation and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. Sponsored refugees will be granted 36 months leave to remain in the UK, and will be entitled to work, benefits and public services. Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said councils ""will be central in helping families settle into their communities"". He called on Mr Gove's department to work closely with local leaders so the scheme ""can move at pace and scale"". First minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said yesterday that Scotland ""stands ready"" to take 3,000 Ukrainian refugees immediately as a ""super sponsor"". But Ms Sturgeon said she was worried the UK sponsorship scheme would be too ""slow and cumbersome"", and may not be sustainable for the length of time that people may need to stay in the UK. When Asked on BBC'sSunday Morningprogramme if Mr Gove would take someone in, he said: ""I'm exploring what I can do, I know that there are others who have. Without going into my personal circumstances, there are a couple of things I need to sort out - but yes."" Mr Gove said yesterday that ""more than 3,000 visas"" have now been issued to those fleeing the war with family in the UK, as the government came in for more criticism over its failure to follow the EU approach and waive visa requirements. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was time for Boris Johnson to sack home secretary PritiPatelover her department's handling of the Ukrainian refugee crisis. ""Her inaction does not befit the British people, with all our compassion and generosity,"" he told his party's spring conference. ""It couldn't be clearer that PritiPatelis not up to the job. The buck stops with the prime minister. So Boris Johnson must sack her, now."" Ireland's premier Micheal Martin said his country's humanitarian response trumps security checks on arriving Ukrainians. ""Our primary impulse is to assist those fleeing war,"" he told the BBC.

According to the United Nations, more than 3 million Ukrainians - including half the country's children - have left since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade one month ago. Mr Biden is expected to make the announcement on Thursday from Brussels, Belgium, where he has traveled to attend an extraordinary Nato summit and meet with the European Council to discuss the West's response to the ongoing crisis. A decision to accept such a large number of refugees would be one of the largest influxes of refugees into the US in recent years, and would come after criticism that Mr Biden and the United States have not done enough to absorb the massive flow of persons who've been displaced by Russian forces over the last four weeks.  On 12 March, Polish president Andrzej Duda called on the US to ""speed up"" the processing of Ukrainian refugees who have relatives already living in the US during a joint appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris.  According to US census data, more than 350,000 Ukrainian immigrants currently reside in the United States. At the time, Mr Duda said the crisis would ""end up in a refugee disaster"" if the US did not act swiftly. But despite promises from Mr Biden to welcome refugees with open arms, his administration has not taken the sorts of public steps that would signal openness to a large flow of displaced persons.  Instead, Biden Administration officials have stressed that the US response to the crisis thus far has been to support efforts by Poland and other neighbouring countries to accept refugees who cross from Ukraine via land borders.

Researchers from the ONE Campaign said the Russian invasion has destroyed the government's rationale for cutting aid spending from the level of 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent of gross national income in 2020. The non-profit group has called on chancellor Rishi Sunak to bring forward the planned restoration of the 0.7 per cent figure, warning that failure to do so will mean life-saving programmes will be withdrawn from some of the world's poorest nations. The Ukrainian war means that the UK will no longer be able to meet its strategic priorities and international obligations within the reduced budget, it added.  Some £220m of UK aid money has been diverted so far to meet immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the disruption to Ukrainian wheat exports, which make up 10 per cent of global supply, has sent food prices soaring around the world, including in developing countries. ONE UK director Romilly Greenhill said it was ""absolutely the case"" that refugees fleeing Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine need to be supported as much as people facing famine in east Africa do. But she said ""by keeping our aid budget unnecessarily reduced, the UK is not in a position to do both; it's forcing itself into a situation where it has to choose between people in crisis,"" adding that ""we're seeing a convergence of crises that mean you can't just pick and choose which problem to deal with in a vacuum"". The aid cut - equivalent to £4.5bn a year - was described as a ""temporary"" measure. Mr Sunak has said he hopes to restore spending to its previous level in 2024-25, but Ms Greenhill said this timetable needs to be accelerated. A report by ONE found that a series of humanitarian disasters, including the Ukraine refugee crisis and the controversial decision to include Covid vaccines in the aid budget, had made the argument for the cut increasingly ""out of date"". The group's report comes days before Mr Sunak's mini-budget statement on Wednesday and ahead of the expected publication of the Foreign Office's international development strategy. ""We're in a different place to when the aid budget was first cut,"" said Ms Greenhill. ""Since the chancellor announced the cut in 2020, circumstances have changed, and the justification that was used then no longer holds. ""The government cannot deliver on its own agenda at the current budget, and with more and more spend being added, UK aid is being stretched to breaking point. It's pushing existing anti-poverty work out."" ONE's analysis, carried out before the invasion of Ukraine, found that the decision to cut UK aid meant 4 million fewer girls will have access to a decent education and that 1 million women and children under five will be at risk of malnutrition. It also found that aid to low-income countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen had been slashed, while some middle-income countries like China and Brazil saw a rise in funds received. UK overseas development aid to Ethiopia fell by 55 per cent from £240.5m in 2020-21 to £107.5m in 2021-22, while China's funding rose from £2.2m to £13.7m in the same period, the report found. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has a long history of helping other countries in need and we are one of the largest aid spenders globally. ""We are leading the world in protecting people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and have already provided £220 million in aid, including for life-saving medical supplies, shelter and hygiene kits.""

Matt Westfall, 52, raised more than £11,000 to get six black cabs, one car, and one van across to Poland to deliver humanitarian aid to refugee camps set up near the Ukrainian border, and transport refugees trying to reach cities across Europe. Mr Westfall, who has been a taxi driver in London for 11 years, arrived home on Wednesday and said ""there are no words"" to describe the four-day trip. ""I've not got a big enough vocabulary to tell you how I felt,"" the 52-year-old from Buckhurst Hill, Essex told the PA news agency. ""Pain, heartbreak, relief... It changed me forever. ""I can't comprehend what they've been through, all I can do is try and smile and do what I can for them... There's no words."" Mr Westfall decided to launch a GoFundMe for the cause when he saw a video online of a Ukrainian father saying goodbye to his family as he left them to enlist in the military. With the help of more than £6,700 donated by strangers on the fundraising site and contributions from the London Taxi Drivers' Association and Eclipse Rent-A-Taxi, Mr Westfall set off on Sunday with a group of taxi drivers he had recruited for the task. The group drove 13 hours to Warsaw , Poland where they delivered aid such as sanitary products, baby food, nappies, and toilet roll, and picked up two families per vehicle to drive back across the continent. ""I had a mum and daughter in my cab, they were going to Munich... Three families were going to Hamburg where they have family and friends,"" Mr Westfall explained.

""She has family in Munich and that's where she is now, so I think they're going to be starting a new life in Germany."" Mr Westfall also spoke about the moment that will ""live with (him) forever"" when transporting the woman and her young daughter. ""This little dot, she didn't want to talk... She looked very grey and pasty and tired,"" he said. ""Her mum said, 'I'm quite worried really, she's not eaten, not drunk anything.' ""So my mate got down on his knee and said: 'I know what all kids like... McDonalds'."" ""Her little eyes just lit up like switching on a light and it was just amazing...

Moscow made the emergency order last month to move 95,739 people of the Russian Federation, Ukraine , Donetsk, and Lugansk away from the war zones to be resettled as far as 5,500 miles away from their homes, the Kremlin decree seen by The i stated. It comes amid several reports that Russian forces have allegedly forcibly disappeared, held captive or interrogated people in Ukrainian towns since Mr Putin's invasion of the country on 24 February.  The decree stated that ""taking into account the current situation"" in Ukraine, the Russian federation ""approves the distribution"" of citizens to the ""constituent entities of the Russian Federation"" and asked authorities to ""ensure the reception"" of 95,739 people. It included provisions to send 11,398 people to Siberia, 7,218 to the Far East and 7,023 to the North Caucasus, including other regions such as the heavily-militarised republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan. Citing separate documents, the report added that people in the port city of Mariupol were being asked to sign papers that claimed Ukrainian troops shelled their city. The signatories were reportedly told they cannot return to Ukraine because they will face ""persecution"". The number of Ukrainians that have been internally displaced has reachedover 7.1 million since the invasion of the country, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Sima Bahous, director of UN Women, said the ""mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags"". Demanding an end to the war, she said: ""We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability."" Meanwhile, an eight-mile convoy of Russian troops seen in satellite imagery heading towards Ukraine's Donbas region is the latest evidence to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's claim that Russia is preparing for renewed attacks. Mr Zelensky said Russia's war on Ukraine could be entering a ""new stage of terror"" citing threats from the use of chemical weapons in the besieged city of Mariupol. The Ukrainian parliament also said that it received reports of Russian forces firing ""nitric acid"" in the Donetsk region. It follows inputs from British intelligence on Monday that warned of the potential use of phosphorous by Russian forces in Mariupol. The US Defence Department has said they are monitoring the unconfirmed reports of the use of chemical munitions.

In the interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson said the migrants have already been served ""notices of intent,"" marking the start of the process.

The charity Hope and Aid Direct was set up in the 1990s in response to the Balkans conflict but nothing has prepared them for the outpouring of help, both needed and offered, it has received since the war broke out in the Ukraine. Trustee Roger Wilson has travelled to Eastern Europe to help with the aid operation as more than a million refugees have fled Ukraine and travelled into neighbouring countries. Our phones, inboxes, WhatsApp groups and all other forms of communications have gone totally mad Charity trustee Roger Wilson Mr Wilson said the charity was focusing its aid efforts on Romania , Slovakia , and Moldova. ""Our phones, inboxes, WhatsApp groups and all other forms of communications have gone totally mad,"" he said. ""But the transportation of aid is complex, you can't just load a van and go."" He said that to send aid to help Ukrainian refugees the charity had to be sponsored by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the country receiving the aid. They, in turn, need to have the correct warehousing and facilities to receive the aid and move it on to those that need it most. Mr Wilson, from Sussex, said he travelled to the region to monitor the situation and understand where their support could best be utilised. ""In Poland, there is a sense of organised chaos,"" he said. ""People are arriving, food, medical supplies and the right type of aid is available - and there are systems in place for the onward journeys to major cities in the country. ""Unfortunately, the story is not the same for other border countries, such as Romania, Slovakia and Moldova."" In Slovakia, while the borders are very similar, people are arriving mostly on foot, he said. It is busier than the Polish border with many smaller volunteer organisations on the ground and less coordination. ""It felt different and less hospitable,"" Mr Wilson said. ""Amongst the many with a genuine desire to provide support, there are some offering 'help' in exchange for, I am not sure for what, but you certainly get the feeling that the bowl of soup is far from free."" Mr Wilson said the Essex-based charity had good contacts with several NGOs across Slovakia, Romania and Moldova. ""I travelled to the region to meet up with some long term contacts we have in the region,"" he said. ""I am confident that we now have reliable NGOs that we can work with in Romania immediately and Moldova and Slovakia for future trips. We are ready to go.""

Polling by YouGov shows that in March, three-quarters of people supported resettling Ukrainians in the UK and 42 per cent thought the figure should be in the tens of thousands ""at least"". But the figures have now dropped to 71 per cent of people supporting resettlement, with 29 per cent wanting to see tens of thousands of refugees welcomed. There is no resettlement scheme for Ukrainian refugees, with the government instead offering three-year visas - that do not amount to a grant of asylum - to people who have relatives in the UK or are sponsored by volunteers. So far, there have been 175,100 applications to the scheme, 148,300 of which have been granted, and 91,000 Ukraine visa holders have arrived in the UK. Ministers set up a bespoke Afghan resettlement process following the Taliban takeover last year, but YouGov's polling shows that only half the public support it. The scheme, which started in January, has been applied to some of the 15,000 people who were already in the UK after being evacuated from Afghanistan. Although the figures have fallen, the research indicates that British people are more supportive of Ukrainian refugees than those from other nations. YouGov said its research suggested that the ""British public feel less generous and more morally conflicted about refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and Somalia, compared to Ukraine, with Conservative voters particularly likely to take a harder stance on refugees from these countries"". When asked the same question for each nationality, 71 per cent of people said they would support resettling Ukrainian refugees, half said they would support resettling Afghan refugees, 48 per cent said they would support resettling Syrians and 40 per cent would support the same for Somalian refugees. The figures are particularly stark for Conservative voters. While almost three-quarters welcomed Ukrainian refugees, only 37 per cent said the same for Afghans, under a third for Syrians and a fifth for Somalis. Tory supporters were also more likely to see Afghan, Syrian and Somali refugees as ""a threat"" than Labour supporters or the public at large, although just 5 per cent thought the same for Ukrainians. Conservatives were also less likely to believe the UK has a ""moral obligation"" to offer asylum. The Reset Communities and Refugees charity said it was still receiving a ""high level of interest"" from people offering to accommodate Ukrainians in their homes. But chief executive Kate Brown added: ""We know levels of interest change according to the news agenda and cost of living pressures, and that compassion fatigue can also set in. ""Even so, we are continuing to see high levels of interest from people in hosting Ukrainian people in their own homes, having trained more than 3,000 sponsors under our Homes for Ukraine matching service. At the same time, we have had record numbers of applications from volunteer community sponsorship groups coming together to welcome refugees from a range of countries."" Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: ""The only thing that should matter in our refugee protection policy is a person's need for protection. There is no wrong type of refugee. ""We believe that the public has huge compassion for those seeking safety. However, it is the government that has sought to stoke up divisions by pitting one group of refugees against another, setting up bespoke resettlement schemes for some while creating an ugly deportation plan to Rwanda for others. ""What we need is a refugee protection system that is built on compassion for all those that need it.""

The International Tourism and Events student at Glasgow Caledonian University said: ""In war, it's always the innocent civilians that suffer. I feel as if I have to do something to help."" The student, who lives in the west end of Glasgow, has delivered more than 30 second-hand ambulances to war zones in Burma, Syria , Iraq, and Yemen.  His journey to Ukraine includes a ferry crossing from Newcastle to the Netherlands , where he will then drive through Germany and then to the border in Poland. Once in mainland Europe during the 1,500-mile trip, he plans to fill the vehicle with much-needed aid. ""One ambulance can only help a few hundred people but there are tens of thousands in need,"" the third-year student said. ""It is heart-breaking to see what is happening over there. The ambulance can be used to transport disabled people, older people, or can be filled up with medical supplies."" Once in Ukraine it is hoped the ambulance will be used within the war-torn country to distribute supplies and transport civilians out of immediate danger.

Now, more than a month later, they remain stranded on Oahu without access to their house, money, family or friends. They've found support through the local canoe paddling community, which set them up with a place to stay and raised money online to help get them settled. They do not know if they will ever be able return to their home. Vasyl and Marina Prishchak and their three daughters, ages 5, 10 and 16, arrived in Hawaii in the middle of February and had an idyllic, three-week beach vacation planned before Russia invaded Ukraine.  ""This vacation changed our life,"" said Vasyl Prishchak, who along with his wife owns a cosmetics company with stores in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. ""We don't know how we return to Ukraine and what we will do, we will begin from zero, from scratch."" They are unsure if their house near a military base in Kyiv is still standing and say they are financially imperiled because their family business has been forced to close.  The family had been to Hawaii several times before to visit with longtime friends Borys and Beata Markin. Vasyl and Borys have been friends for about 30 years and are both avid ocean paddlers.  The community has helped the family with everything from schooling and immigration questions to financial help and a place to stay. Until last week they were staying at a loaned home in Kailua, a beach town on the windward side of Oahu, but family friend Beata Markin said they've now secured a small cottage in Kaneohe where the owner is allowing them to stay free of charge for as long as they need.  ""They have nowhere to go,"" said Markin, who was born in Hungary and has lived with her Ukrainian husband in Hawaii for eight years. ""I think it's our responsibility to make sure they are OK here.""  An online fundraiser organized by canoe club members has so far raised more than $32,000 for the family. ""Sadly, we can't help all the Ukrainians, but we can help this family,"" wrote Charlotte Johnson, an Oahu resident who helped set up the fundraiser. ""The banking system in Ukraine is a shambles, and they cannot access any of their accounts. None of us can even imagine going on a vacation only to find the life left no longer exists."" Globally, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were overseas when Russia invaded. In addition, the United Nations says more than 3.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, the biggest movement of people in Europe since World War II. While U.S. officials could not immediately say exactly how many Ukrainians were in the U.S. on tourism or business visas when the war began, the Department of Homeland Security expects an estimated 75,000 Ukrainians to be eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status, which will allow them to stay in the country for 18 months.  Though the Prishchak family hopes to eventually return home, they are applying to stay under the program, which was created in 1990 to allow people to remain in the U.S. because of civil strife or natural disasters in their home countries. Permission is extended until Homeland Security deems conditions are stable enough for people to return. The U.S. is also expanding efforts to help Ukrainian refugees elsewhere. While in Brussels to meet with European allies last week, President Joe Biden said the U.S. would admit up to 100,000 more Ukrainian refugees and provide $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to countries affected by Russia's invasion. Prishchak's oldest daughter, 16-year-old Mariia, said her excitement about vacationing in Hawaii was quickly replaced by fear for loved ones.  In the first week, they took a lot of photos, she said, but ""one day we disappeared from all social media because it is no time to post these photos when people suffer."" Mariia said she had always dreamed about going to school in the U.S., but not under such terrible circumstances. She checks in with friends and family every morning and night to make sure they are safe.  ""Every day, I hope that next day everything will be finished,"" she said. ""And it's awful. I'm confused and I can't do anything else except for thinking about the situation."" Her father said it's difficult being in the safety of a tropical paradise while other men his age are back home fighting and not allowed to leave the country.  ""It's a really terrible feeling that eats away at you from inside when you understand that all your close relatives are now in a very complicated situation,"" the elder Prishchak said in Russian. ""And there's no way you can help them stop this absolute insanity. It's a feeling that simply eats you up inside, you could say. A horrible sensation, an inner guilt that I'm here and not there.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Aid"

But what is it like sharing your home with someone who has fled war? Rachel and Nigel Poulton have been welcoming refugees into their North Yorkshire home for five and a half years, and are hoping to house a Ukrainian family soon.  Rachel's advice to anyone considering taking a refugee into their home is simple: ""A warm welcome goes a long way.""  She continues: ""We just try and give them a warm, calm welcome. We don't ask questions and I always tell them that I'm glad that they are here."" The Poultons are already housing a number of unaccompanied child refugees at the moment, but have a spare room that they are hoping to offer to a Ukrainian family.  Ms Poulton said: ""We have a large family room that we built onto the side of our house, originally to look after ageing parents. It's got an en suite, and space for children and a cot, and we're hoping to use it soon."" They have signed up to welcome a Ukrainian family through the charity Sanctuary Foundation, and through the government scheme.  ""I feel like I'm learning the whole time,"" said Ms Poulton, ""and I'm sure we do make mistakes. But people shouldn't feel like they need all the answers. If there is compassion that comes from the heart, people can sense that. If you are genuine it shows."" Rachel Poulton and her husband, who works as CEO of a children's charity, have taken in unaccompanied child refugees from Eritrea, Syria, Afghanistan and a number of other countries over the past few years.  They work with the local council and social workers to make sure that their new lodgers get settled into the community before they move on. ""I always tell them that I want them to feel safe,"" Ms Poulton said. ""If it was one of our kids in their situation - in a foreign country, with no money, who couldn't speak the language, and who had gone through desperately hard circumstances - I would want someone to open their doors and be kind to them."" She often writes a welcome card for her guests when they arrive. ""Those little things can mean more than we realise,"" Ms Poulton said.  ""There was one time when a young man was moving on, having been with us for a couple of years. He was quite a tough, cool guy, and I was helping him pack, and he put the little card in.  ""I was so surprised he still had it. He said that it had been really important to him when he first came, so he had kept it."" The best bit about sheltering refugees is being there when good things happen in their lives, she said.  ""Last night we went out to celebrate the birthday of one of the refugees who used to live here, and it was such a joyful evening,"" Rachel added. ""It's also a joy to see people learn to drive, achieve at school, and learn new skills like the piano and swimming."" Her two young children, who are still at home, have also learnt to get along well with their new housemates.  But as well as the positives, the people Rachel and Nigel take in have experienced a lot of trauma before they stay with them. ""They have dealt with so much on their journeys to the UK, in the countries that they come from, and also in the ongoing news they see through their mobiles.  ""This will be true of Ukrainians too. They will experience ongoing trauma when they look at the footage and keep up with the bad news."" She is worried that many Ukrainians fleeing the war will see Britain as too difficult to get to, too slow at processing documentation, and too far away.  She also has concerns about how they will be transported from Ukraine or the Polish border to the homes in Britain that are keen to accept them.  Levelling up secretary Michael Gove told MPs that Ukrainians with no family links would be allowed to come to the UK under the new scheme, and that there would be ""no limit"" to the number who can benefit.  They will have to have a ""sponsor"" in the UK who is willing to provide them with a home for a minimum of 6 months.  ""If you don't know anyone who you wish to sponsor, you may wish to get in touch with charities, faith groups, or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals,"" the government guidance said.  Some 1.4 million children have now fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, meaning nearly one child a second has become a refugee, the UN said on Tuesday.

The scheme is a ""smokescreen"" and distraction from what really needs to happen, which is remove the visa requirement for Ukrainians like other European countries have done, said Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing. More than 122,000 Britons have registered their interest in taking in Ukrainians, and those who have found someone to sponsor will be able to apply from Friday. The scheme aims to match refugees with individuals, charities and other organisations who can provide accommodation for at least six months, enabling Ukrainians without family ties in the UK to enter the country. But Ms Qureshi said the Government had put NGOs in an ""invidious"" position and foistered the scheme on them without prior consultation. She only expects a ""trickle"" of refugees to arrive through the scheme because they will have to find people to become sponsors while abroad before they can apply, and then make their own way to the UK. She said it could take ""months and months of processing"" to safely match people to appropriate homes. She told the PA news agency: ""The people that need to come here, their life depends on being able to get into this country using the current route, and that's what's worrying us more than more than anything. ""Are some of the people going to be alive by the time the process has been gone through? ""They should be letting people in now, but the Government is doing to refugees what they've done to the Syrians and to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, and what they're doing is to reduce to an absolute minimum the number of refugees making their way to the UK in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since World War Two."" Positive Action in Housing runs Room for Refugees, the UK's longest running refugee hosting programme which has been in place since 2002. Ms Qureshi said the charity is receiving around 40 calls and up to 150 emails an hour from Brits wanting to offer accommodation to Ukrainian refugees. Almost 70 Ukrainian refugee families have registered with the charity, including 60 children and several heavily pregnant women currently in Ukraine, France, Poland, Belgium and Germany. The team will be working through the night to match them with vetted people who have registered as potential sponsors, and to support them while they apply for visas from Friday. Ms Qureshi also questioned how many people who have expressed an interest via the Government's website will have to withdraw because they later realise they do not have ""the physical or mental room"". She said: ""We do not have half a hosting program in place. ""All they've got is expressions of interest - they have not identified individuals to match them up.... this is an illusion of people helping because they're distracting from the fact that they haven't lifted visa restrictions."" It comes as the Government was urged to set up an emergency airlift for Ukrainian refugees on the Polish border. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK Government should provide free flights to the UK, as well as coaches to take people from border crossing points to the airport. Writing to Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, he also called for welcome centres to be opened for refugees arriving in Britain. The public has been praised for its ""hugely generous response"" after the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal reached £200 million - two weeks after launching. This equates to around £3 for every person in the UK, the DEC said. We are concerned the scheme could be too slow and complex to help some of the most vulnerable Andy Hewett, of the Refugee Council The Refugee Council said it has several concerns about the scheme, specifically around red tape, safeguarding and resourcing. Andy Hewett, head of advocacy, said it is concerned the scheme could be ""too slow and complex"" to help the most vulnerable, and said it favours those who already have a contact in the UK, who may not necessarily be the most at risk. James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said councils will need to be given as much data as possible on who a visa has been issued to, such as their age, medical and educational needs, family make-up, and more clarity on the safeguarding and accommodation checks they will need. He acknowledged councils will not be able to do everything they would like to do ""up front"" but said ""taking people from a very, very, very dangerous situation to a relatively safe space is something that we need to do as quickly as possible"". He told PA: ""I think this will be a two-stage process: there will be an initial check, let's get people away from the bombs as fast as possible, because clearly a bomb landing on your head is a very dangerous situation. ""And then once we've got them here, we've got a roof over their head and we've moved on from the immediate danger, then I think there will be a second or third process or a phase where we will go back, we will check what the situation's like with these people in this accommodation.""

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also indicate that people who have come to Britain after fleeing Putin’s invasion have struggled to access healthcare.  The survey of 3,412 individuals on both the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme found that 37 per cent reported they have enough money to support themselves and their dependents for the next three months – indicating that nearly two-thirds do not. Around four in five (83 per cent) working-age respondents reported they were currently working, or that they were very likely or likely to look for work in the UK in the next month. The findings also show that a third of respondents were receiving regular healthcare treatment before leaving Ukraine, but only 22 per cent of them said this treatment had continued since arriving in the UK. Around one in five respondents (21 per cent) reported receiving regular prescriptions for medication or drugs while in Ukraine, but only 37 per cent said they have been able to access regular prescriptions and drugs since arriving in the UK. It comes after it emerged last month that 660 households who have come to Britain via these routes have been forced to register as homeless. The data, published by the Department for Levelling up, Communities and Housing, revealed that of the homeless households, 480 were families with at least one child, while 180 were single households. Government figures show 109,700 refugees have so far come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, while 45,900 have arrived under the family scheme. The ONS survey also revealed that around four in ten respondents (38 per cent) said they intend to stay in the UK for three years or more, while 29 per cent said they intended to stay for up to three years and 30 per cent did not know. It shows that the overwhelming majority who have arrived are women with children, and nearly half can speak or read English.

Some are offering up their homes to host refugees, while others are organising collections of goods to send to people in Ukraine or neighbouring countries.  These are very generous solutions, but I'd like to explain why donating cash to charities is better; and why some charities will then pass on those cash donations as cash, rather than buying goods. We understand why people like to donate goods in an emergency, but we can't send food, clothes, blankets or medical equipment from the UK even if they're in perfect condition. Customs regulations and transport costs make the process of exporting items very complicated, time-consuming and expensive. The expense is usually more than the goods are worth. We also don't have the capacity to sort the goods here or to distribute them once there. It's usually much easier to buy items in the countries where they are needed. It's also usually cheaper and helps local markets and economies, helping countries to get back on their feet.  Think of the carbon footprint of driving goods 1,500 miles, when they could just as easily be bought in a shop in Poland, Moldova or Romania.  So, this explains why donating cash is better than donating goods. But what will we do with your donations once we have them? Well, sometimes, we won't even buy goods in-country or in neighbouring countries. Sometimes we will just give cash to people in need of help. Imagine fleeing your home under heavy bombardment. If you're lucky, there will be a break in shelling, and you'll have a car. You will pack it up with as much as you can and you will cross the border into a safe, neighbouring country. If you're not so lucky, you'll have travelled by foot, carrying with you as much as you can in a small case. Either way, you won't have much with you. You'll be leaving so much behind. When you reach the safety of a neighbouring country, you'll be exhausted and in despair. You'll be desperate to maintain contact with your friends and family back home or in other neighbouring countries. But you'll no longer be earning money. You may not be able to access your savings from the bank. You may not have any savings. You'll need food and drink and warmth; you may need credit for your phone so you can keep in touch with your loved ones. So, it is highly likely that you will need and want cash.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices newsletter by clicking here Charities can hand over cash to people in need of help so they can make choices on how best to spend the money. It's a dignified way of giving people support. It lets people know we trust them. It gives people freedom and power when they have none. And it helps local economies. In most situations, there is strong evidence that money - not goods - is the most efficient and effective way to distribute emergency aid. Giving cash transfers is not wasteful, does not create dependency and is empowering and effective. There are some concerns that cash could be diverted, but there are ways to prevent waste, in particular by paying directly to beneficiaries and being very clear about who is getting what. Quality control is vital too. Some people have donated infant formula and, while that is well-intentioned, that can be dangerous. People on the move often do not have a clean reliable place to mix the formula or clean the feeding equipment. They might not be able to mix it with clean water. They might also not be able to dilute the artificial milk in the right way if the label is not in their language. When infant formula is donated during emergencies, we tend to see a direct correlation between these donations and babies falling sick - or even dying.  So please, give cash not goods. And please also welcome it when charities say they are setting up cash transfer programmes.   Donations can be made at www.dec.org.uk or by calling 0370 60 60 900.

But the refugee camps were overflowing, so he made his way further west, towards Germany and eventually France. There, he made some friends and decided that, because he knew some broken English, he would make his way into Britain. He had heard good things about the country in the media and was hopeful he would be welcomed. But as he was making his way across the English Channel, in a boat full of other refugees, they were stopped. Now the government wants to deport him to Rwanda for processing. As one of the first deportation flights to Rwanda gets under way, he may be on it.  Surely, most right thinking people would be outraged by the prospect of us deporting a desperate and deserving asylum seeker such as Andriy to Rwanda? After all, his land is being bombarded and destroyed, and he just travelled across a continent for safety, only to find out he was being shipped off to a country run by a cruel dictator.  Now, imagine if we did the same to a Syrian refugee. Their country is in the exact same situation : being bombed by Vladimir Putin to help the dictator Bashar al-Assad maintain control. Entire towns have been blown into smithereens exactly like Mariupol. Millions of Syrians simply have nowhere to live. The neighbouring countries are already overflowing with refugees, so some have gone further away to find shelter. And yet, while Boris Johnson was adamant that no Ukrainian refugee would end up going to Rwanda, his home secretary is currently trying to deport Syrians to Rwanda. I made up the story of Andriy Kovalenko – there’s no such case as far as I know – to illustrate a point: while Syrians and Ukrainians are largely in the same situation, there is a huge difference in how our government is treating them. For one, British people are being actively encouraged to take Ukrainian refugees into their homes to house them in Britain –we’re even being paid to do so.  Some might argue that we have more obligation towards fellow Europeans than to those escaping conflict in the Middle East or further away like South Asia. I wouldn’t necessarily call that racist – I think it’s ok to say we have added obligation towards our neighbours. But the same argument was made against Jews escaping Nazi Germany (which is why we only allowed in the children ) and the same argument was made against Asians escaping persecution from Idi Amin in Uganda. And yet, German Jews and Ugandan Asians – along with people from Hong Kong and Vietnam and many other refugees from across the world – have made Britain their home and contributed immensely towards British life and prosperity. We should treat people according to their need, not their proximity. We should treat Syrians and Ukrainians equally – only that would be fair. If the scheme to deport refugees to Rwanda makes you uncomfortable, it should do. The cruelty is the point. Priti Patel and Johnson don’t care how much it costs, they think it sends a strong message and will act as a deterrent. But the same was said about Theresa May’s “hostile environment” policies and they didn’t deter anyone either. The British government’s starkly different approach towards Ukrainian and Syrian refugees should make us think twice. Do we want to be known for our generosity and fairness, or a country that doesn’t think twice about locking up refugees in a detention camp in a dictatorship?  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here I don’t believe the public supports this government’s cruelty. But they have been sold a lie that this is the only “tough decision” possible to stop trafficking and the channel deaths. That has already proven to be false.  If this government was intent on stopping trafficking, it would go after the traffickers, not the desperate refugees. If there are too many refugees being housed in hotels, it’s because the home office has been shown to be incapable of processing people quickly and letting them earn their own living. Instead they are left in limbo, forced to rely on the state when they would prefer to be self-sufficient. The Andriy Kovalenko I mentioned earlier may have been fictitious, but the story of his journey is shared by thousands of refugees. And it’s undoubtedly a story of refugees being treated differently because of their origin. That’s a story that should shame this government and its supporters.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-06",1,"Migration"

Hours earlier the Home Secretary ruled out a visa waiver for those fleeing the conflict with Russia over security concerns. Speaking with ITV's Peston on Monday night, she reiterated statements made earlier in the day about the priority of safeguarding ""our public and our people"" from ""Putin's Russia"". She added that ""further changes"" would be announced in the ""next few days"" to help the people of Ukraine, but the current situation was ""very fluid and dynamic"". Ms Patel went on: ""This is absolutely a phased approach around humanitarian support for the people of Ukraine. So this isn't just about what we do on visas and our policy, this is much wider than that. ""So over the last weeks we've been focused on getting British nationals out of Ukraine, we've changed all sorts of things in terms of visas and prioritisation of cases. That's the first aspect to this. ""Our policies are evolving - this is changing, this is a very fluid and dynamic situation. And in fact there will be further changes and announcements that we'll be making in the next few days as well."" The Home Secretary, who has come under intense political pressure from MPs across the Commons to do more to allow Ukrainian refugees to reach the UK, insisted she was taking action to open safe routes. Ms Patel also faced criticism from refugee charities for falling short of the package of measures put forward by all 27 EU member countries. According to UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi 520,000 refugees from Ukraine have so far fled to neighbouring countries and the number keeps rising. The UN is planning for up to four million refugees in the coming weeks if the conflict doesn't end, he said. ""We know that we are not even scratching the surface to meet the needs of Ukrainians,"" he told an emergency Security Council meeting. Earlier on Monday Ms Patel told MPs in the Commons she was following the ""strongest security advice"" as she rejected the call to scrap the need for visas. ""Over the weekend I have seen members of this House calling for full visa waivers for all Ukrainians,"" Ms Patel said. ""Security and biometric checks are a fundamental part of our visa approval process worldwide and will continue, as they did for the evacuation of people from Afghanistan. ""That is vital to keep British citizens safe and to ensure that we are helping those in genuine need, particularly as Russian troops are now infiltrating Ukraine and merging into Ukrainian forces. ""Intelligence reports also state the presence of extremist groups and organisations who threaten the region but also our domestic homeland. ""We know all too well what Putin's Russia is willing to do, even on our soil, as we saw through the Salisbury attack."" The Home Secretary said the first phase of the ""bespoke humanitarian route"" being created for Ukrainians to enter the UK would allow around 100,000 people to come to ""seek sanctuary"". The Government has already announced measures allowing people who are settled in the UK to be able to bring their Ukrainian immediate family members to join them.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Ukrainians living in Northern Ireland also gave emotional testimony at the demonstration. After the event, protesters marched through the city to gather for a vigil outside City Hall. Mr Duncan and Fr Magill stood side by side to address the rally. ""We stand together here in unity with the people of Ukraine,"" said Mr Duncan. ""What we see happening and unfolding in front of our TV sets I can't come up with a word for it, there isn't a strong enough word that I can think of for the horror that's happening in Ukraine.""

Kateryna Kozlova, from the Ukrainian city of Kherson, told the crowds of the anxiety trying to reach relatives on the phone. ""It's the worst feeling ever when you do not know whether your family is still alive,"" she said.

A class action lawsuit is being prepared over ""inordinate and unreasonable delays"" in processing hundreds of visa applications made in March. Figures shared with the PA News Agency last week, compiled by would-be hosts, show there were at least 800 Ukrainian refugees still waiting for visas after applying within the first two weeks of the scheme opening. The groups behind the action, Vigil 4 Visas and Taking Action Over the Homes for Ukraine Visa Delays, say the delays have put people in Ukraine and border countries at risk, and heaped ""considerable pressure and strain"" on UK hosts. Lawyers for the groups are planning to send a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office this week. Katherine Klinger, who has helped organise vigils outside the Home Office over the past week, told PA: ""Perhaps the most striking thing I've noticed is the utter despair, shame and sense of responsibility so many hosts report. ""Hosts are in tears sometimes when they report to us what has happened in the past six weeks - dozens of emails, phone calls, letters, trips to the Home Office, MPs' involvement etc - it's very humbling."" The groups are due to launch an online Crowdfunder on Tuesday morning to raise up to £15,000 to help pay for the legal costs. The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes. Government spokesperson The legal letter will highlight ten cases of Ukrainians who are still waiting for their visas after applying during the days after the Homes for Ukraine scheme first opened on March 18. These include the case of a Ukrainian mother and her daughter, aged under 10, who applied for their visas around five weeks ago. The mother received her visa on April 18 but the little girl is still waiting. PA has reported on multiple similar cases where family members, usually with young children, are waiting for longer than their relatives for permission to travel. The legal action is being prepared by Amanda Jones, an immigration and public law barrister, and follows a previous successful individual challenge, the group said. They said the judicial review would be brought on the grounds that the Home Office has a policy of delaying the March applications, and deciding later applications instead; or that the system is so chaotic and unstable that it is unreasonable. A Government spokesperson said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. Over 86,000 visas have been issued so Ukrainians can live and work in the UK. ""The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-05",1,"Migration"

She Highlighted the case of Kateryna Razumenko, who reportedly fled her home and is now in Poland while trying to reunite with family in the UK. Ms van der Zysaid: ""This is a fast-moving situation and I am sure that both the Government and civil servants are working around the clock to ensure that the United Kingdom plays its role in accepting and supporting refugees.

Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has said the process of matching Britons with people fleeing the conflict will take place from Friday, while he expects the first refugees to use the new route will make their way to the UK by the end of the week. Mr Gove said more than 3,000 visas have so far been issued to Ukrainians seeking help in the UK, with the Cabinet minister estimating ""tens of thousands"" more will be provided.  - What is the scheme?  The Homes for Ukraine programme will allow individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to bring people escaping the war to safety - even if they have no ties to the UK. Anyone with a room or home available can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family, though those offering will be vetted and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks.  - How long can refugees stay with a family or individual?  Members of the public will be able to nominate a Ukrainian family to stay with them for at least six months. Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years' leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services.  - What security checks will be carried out?  The exact detail is not known, but Mr Gove has said steps will be taken to ensure people who might be ""intent on exploitation"" are prevented from ""abusing"" the new scheme. The Cabinet minister told Sky News: ""We absolutely do need to make sure, first of all, that the people in Ukraine are who they say they are, so there need to be some security checks there. ""There's been understandable concern about the scheme being exploited possibly by criminal elements. So, that's the first thing. ""Then the second thing is we do need to make sure that people here ... are in a position to provide that support, which is why there will need to be security checks as well to make sure that those - and I think it would only ever be a tiny minority, but still - those who might be intent on exploitation can be prevented from abusing the system."" A spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said the charity did not want to see ""unnecessary barriers"" built into the process, but ""it is vital child protection is built into every stage of the Government's and local authorities' response to this crisis"".  - Is there any compensation for hosting?  Britons offering accommodation to Ukrainian refugees will receive a ""thank you"" payment of £350 per month. Mr Gove has also said local authority areas will be entitled to more than £10,000 per Ukrainian refugee using the fresh route to the UK. ""Additional payments"" will be available to support school-age children who need to be accommodated within the education system, he said.  NEW: We're making changes to the Ukraine Family Scheme to make it quicker & simpler.This will mean from Tuesday Ukrainians with passports don't need to visit a Visa Application Centre to provide biometrics before coming here.Security checks will continue on all cases. pic.twitter.com/cpJjgmSwXo - Home Office (@ukhomeoffice) March 10, 2022  - How do you apply?  The Government is due to launch its website gathering expressions of interest from potential hosts on Monday.  - What has been the response?  Mr Gove has said he would personally take in a Ukrainian refugee and Academy Award-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch said from the Baftas red carpet on Sunday that he hopes to take part in the scheme. But there has been criticism too, with the Refugee Council noting unlike the UK all EU countries have waived visa requirements for Ukrainians in the short term. Council chief executive Enver Solomon told The Guardian the UK scheme was ""effectively a managed migration route, which is not suitable to use to respond to a humanitarian crisis"". Mr Solomon also said the programme should only be one part of Britain's response to the crisis. ""But if it's going to work, it needs to be delivered with all the right resource and all the necessary entitlements for Ukrainians - so they're able to get all the healthcare they need, access housing benefit - because the reality is, the sponsor arrangement will be a short-term measure,"" he said. ""This conflict doesn't look like it's going to end quickly. There needs to be a clear pathway to longer-term accommodations."" There have been also concerns about the tight timeframe the Government has provided, with the NSPCC in its statement calling it an ""ambitious turnaround"". The charity said it was ""essential that the Government works closely with local authorities, the fostering community, charities and other key local partners to ensure this sponsorship scheme is ultimately safe; has appropriate levels of support for traumatised Ukrainian children who have fled bloodshed, and on-going assistance available for their sponsors"".","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Aodha","Refugees may have to stay at Dublin airport as Citywest reaches capacity","Refugees arriving in Ireland may have to stay at Dublin Airport overnight as the Citywest welcome hub has reached capacity. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Department of Children, Equality and Integration said there had been a “significant” increase in the number of people seeking accommodation in recent weeks. This has resulted in the transit centre at Citywest reaching capacity and a decision being taken to put a pause on new arrivals until numbers reduce. Between then and now, the Department said that those arriving at the airport “may have to wait there if arriving overnight”, and that supports will be provided to them by an NGO. If room becomes available at Citywest, families and those with vulnerabilities will be prioritised where possible, the Department said. For asylum seekers or those claiming temporary protection, the Department said if accommodation is not immediately available, they will be communicated with and supports will be offered to them through NGOs where possible. Those who have alternative accommodation options are asked to avail of these, “including pledged accommodation”, the Department said. The Ukrainian Embassy was also briefed on the development by officials from the Department. The Government warned back in July that it was facing a “severe shortage” of accommodation for arriving Ukrainians, which resulted in a number of asylum seekers having to stay in a Dublin Airport terminal overnight. Ukrainian refugees were temporarily living in tents at the Gormanstown military camp in Co Meath as other accommodation was sourced. Since then, most of the thousands of units of student accommodation that were used to house some international protection applicants are now unavailable as the housing need continues to grow. Departments were asked to list possible buildings in their possession that could be repurposed to house Ukrainians and other refugees and asylum seekers. The government is also considering whether to charge refugees who have been granted full status and who are working full time rent, if they are still staying in Direct Provision centres. Ireland is now accommodating more than 58,000 people: around 42,000 Ukrainian nationals and 16,000 international protection applicants. This figures compares with 7,250 at the same time last year. The Department said that “access to suitable accommodation is severely constrained”. “Current projections indicate a shortfall of 15,000 beds by December as the number of Ukrainians and IP applicants arriving is expected to remain at elevated levels. “To date, the Department has contracted approximately 25% of hotel beds in Ireland, alongside hostels, guest houses, pledged accommodation, sports stadiums, scout facilities, tented accommodation and modular units. “It continues to work to explore all suitable offers as it has done since March 2022.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-10",0,"Conditions"

Whether it’s a big leg up or a smaller helping hand we all need support sometimes. It’s part of being human -as social creatures we lift each other up when we need it. Most people would be happy to help a friend, neighbour, colleague or even a stranger if they needed it -but a lot of people are too afraid to ask. In fact, according to online research from YouGov into the cost of living, even if people are struggling financially, 77 percent would be very unlikely to ask for help. We think that needs to change. There is power in asking for help and there is joy in giving it. At GoFundMe we see thousands of people sign up to help others everyday. In February, as Russia invaded Ukraine, fundraisers sprang up offering support to those who needed it the most. During the first week of the war a donation was made every minute towards the people of Ukraine. Every single one of those donations came from someone who wanted to help. From the word go, the Association of Ukrainian’s in Great Britain started a fundraiser to get humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees. They managed to raise more than £2,600,000 so far -making it the biggest campaign ever seen on GoFundMe in the UK. That’s a record breaking amount of help. We’ve seen help from individuals who were so affected by coverage they were seeing on the news they were moved to help. Laura and Ken packed up their motorhome Molly with essential supplies and sweets and drove to the Ukrainian border to help refugees who had just fled. By asking people to sponsor their trip they raised more than £6,000 to donate to British Ukrainian Aid.  David Fricker and his friends have travelled to Ukraine to deliver thousands of teddy bears for displaced children -complete with translated messages of love from kids in the UK. His main goal is to make children feel safe when they cross the border. Closer to home, as the UK experiences a major cost of living crisis, the most vulnerable in our society are choosing between heating, eating or paying their bills. In April, after Ofgen lifted the energy cap, bills rose by a massive 54 percent and they are expected to go up again come autumn. Lancashire plumber James Anderson has been helping those in need since last year with his community initiative Depher, fixing boilers for free and paying off heating bills. And when the crisis hit this year, he teamed up again with GoFundMe to launch an emergency appeal to help those struggling with the rising costs. One woman helped by the initiative described how she was left ‘actually in tears’ when she found out she would be able to put her heating on. As times get tougher help, happiness and community is needed more than ever. That’s what society is all about -stepping up and helping those when help is needed. That’s why GoFundMe is supporting the Independent’s Happy List, which shines a light on the people who’ve changed the world for the better by offering a helping hand. Each of the people or groups chosen have done something which is worth celebrating.

More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, according to the U.N. refugee agency, the vast majority seeking refuge in Poland which has taken in more than 1.7 refugees in the last 19 days. In the Polish border town of Przemysl, some of those who are fleeing, mostly women and children, are exhausted and express a simple wish that the war and violence would stop. ""All day crying from the pain of having to part with loved ones, with my husband, my parents,"" said Alexandra Beltuygova, 33, who fled from Dnipro, a city between the embattled metropolises of Kyiv and Mariupol.  ""I understand that we may not see them. I wish this war would end,"" she said. At a refugee center in Suceava in northern Romania, 28-year-old Lesia Ostrovska watched over her 1-year-old son as her daughter, who is 8, played nearby with other children displaced by the war. ""I left my husband, my father, my mother, my grandparents,"" said Ostrovska, who is from Chernivtsi in western Ukraine. ""It's hard with kids, in the bus, here in this situation ... We hope that the war is finished soon and we can go back home."" As the fighting, now in its third week, continues to exact a grievous human toll in Ukraine with Russian troops bombarding many of the country's most populous cities, the number of those crossing into countries on the eastern edge of the EU has begun to slowly wane in recent days.  In Hungary , where around 255,000 refugees have entered so far, only 9,000 people crossed the border with Ukraine on Sunday compared to more than twice that on March 1, according to police.  In Slovakia, where more than 200,000 people have fled, fewer than 9,000 crossed the border on Sunday, down from more than 12,000 four days earlier. And in Poland on Sunday, about 82,000 refugees were admitted, down from an earlier daily peak of around 129,000.  Still, those who managed to flee the violence continued to arrive in countries on Ukraine's western border. In Przemysl, some recounted being witnesses to military attacks on civilians, something Russia continues to deny.  ""I saw destroyed houses and fighting. I saw a lot of tanks when I was driving from Kyiv. I know that a house near us was completely destroyed this morning,"" said Inessa Armashova, 40, a resident of the Ukrainian capital. ""Many people fled. But many cannot leave, sick children or sick elderly people."" The continued push by Russian forces toward Kyiv comes a day after Russia escalated its offensive by launching airstrikes close to the Polish border, raising fears in the West that the fight was edging closer to the EU and members of the NATO military alliance.  Those strikes, which involved waves of deadly Russian missiles hitting a military training base less than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killed at least 35 people and appeared to be the westernmost target struck during Russia's 19-day invasion of Ukraine. Residents of the Polish village of Wielkie Oczy, just two kilometers (over a mile) from the border, were jolted awake in the middle of the night by the sounds of the blasts.  ""My son went out to the balcony and the neighbors were already awoken and the dogs in the whole village started to bark,"" said Franciek Sawicki, 77, who heard the missile attack. ""We could see the glow above the forest. It was very noisy and I could hear a loud explosion. And at that moment I knew it was an attack near the border."" The proximity of the attack to Poland dashed the sense of safety in western Ukraine, which until now had mostly remained free of Russian attacks, and raised the possibility that the NATO alliance could be drawn into the fight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a ""black day,"" and again urged NATO leaders to establish a no-fly zone over the country, a plea that the West has said could escalate the war to a nuclear confrontation. But Anjela, 55, a Ukrainian refugee from Poltava who wouldn't give her last name, said after arriving in Poland that only a NATO intervention could bring an end to the violence in Ukraine. ""I don't know when I will see my husband. I don't know when my children will return home,"" she said. ""I beg you, it depends only on you, close the sky, everything else we will do ourselves."" ___ Justin Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary.

The recent invasion in Ukraine is expected to drive up the price of gas if supplies from Russia are impeded or stopped altogether, with fears household bills could see a further increase. But Sir Ed has urged the Prime Minister to increase the sanctions on associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin , and use the cash to fund a package of measures to help Britons mitigate any rises. I think whether it's Putin's cronies or Russian energy firms, I think they should foot the bill of any gas price hike following Russia's invasion of Ukraine Sir Ed Davey Speaking to journalists during a visit to Scotland on Friday, Sir Ed said there were ""far more"" people with links to Mr Putin who could be on the receiving end of sanctions. ""One thing I think we should look at is we go after their assets, freezing them and beginning the process of seizing the assets of Putin's cronies who have money and property in the UK and using that as a sort of oligarch tax and using some of that money for insulating the UK from the gas price spike that we're seeing,"" he said. ""I think whether it's Putin's cronies or Russian energy firms, I think they should foot the bill of any gas price hike following Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" Money seized should go to doubling winter fuel payments and expanding the warm home discount to include up to 7.5 million people in the UK, Sir Ed said. He also pushed the Government to ""do more"" from a humanitarian standpoint, saying that the UK should be prepared to take Ukrainian refugees. ""I think the UK should be leading an internationally co-ordinated humanitarian response where the UK is welcoming and prepared to house far more refugees from Ukraine,"" the Lib Dem leader said. ""Activists, journalists and others who will be targeted by the Putin regime are desperate to leave Ukraine and I think we need to be part of a co-ordinated effort to host those refugees - and I just think we're not anywhere near where we need to be."" Sir Ed has repeatedly called on the Prime Minister to resign over allegations of parties in and around Downing Street during lockdown which are now subject to a police investigation. He said on Friday that the crisis in Ukraine should not stop Boris Johnson resigning if he is found to have broken the law. ""Yes, of course he should go,"" Sir Ed said. ""I absolutely think that Tory MPs need to stand up and be counted, they're the ones that can make sure that happens and it is a question for Tory MPs to focus on."" When asked if a resignation could impact the response of the Government to the crisis in Ukraine, he said he had not been ""impressed"" by the Prime Minister's response to the issue or to the cost-of-living crisis, adding: ""Frankly, I don't see a problem. ""The UK could manage these problems probably even better with cabinet government, that's my experience.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-02",1,"Policy"

The Golden Retriever had pitched up seemingly out of nowhere that morning, passing through no-man's land to lay his weary head on a piece of covered tarmac just past the Csengersima checkpoint on the Hungarian-Rumanian border.  A woman from the Hungarian Red Cross bent down to offer him food, water and a kind word, but he was too weak to respond, so they called a local animal shelter to pick him up. Six hours later, he was still there.  It was a pitiful sight but also one that flew in the face of the extraordinary care we had seen the Ukrainian refugees show for the pets they had brought with them to escape theRussian bombs.  We had witnessed this during the second week of the invasion at several crossings on the Polish-Ukrainian border and again, in the last week at the Hungarian border - and many told us of the pain they felt about larger pets, mostly dogs, they had been forced to leave behind.  We watched as refugees who had queued for hours on foot carrying young children and their worldly possessions still found the wherewithal to physically carry their pet, often lugging them in pet carriers along with weighty supplies of pet food.  Frequently the ones carrying the pets were young children. Nobody knows exactly how many of the 4 million refugees who fled the country have taken pets, but pet travel specialists PBS Pet Travel estimate that more than 1.25 million pets have crossed the border.  One of the untold stories of this war is surely that of how taking care of a beloved pet at a time of personal and collective trauma can be a helpful, even healing, thing to do.  At Kroscienko on the Polish-Ukrainian border, where refugees endured sub-zero temperatures, we saw Olena Boiko, 39, emerge from her 20-hour journey from Kyiv with her Chihuahua, Dolores, peeking out of her coat.  At the same crossing we saw Vatazhok, 87, on crutches and her friend, Zhanna Zabrodska, 85, in a wheelchair, muster the energy to carry their respective cats, Syoma and Masha.  ""Come feel Masha shivering with cold through my rucksack,"" said Zhanna, tears streaming down her face for her struggling feline companion. The gritty octogenarians had travelled two days from embattled Kharkiv in the north after hiding in a freezing basement for 11 days and in fleeing to save themselves had thought to save their cats too.  There was also sadness for pets left behind. When Sasha Bubnovska, 28, crossed into Poland with her daughters Sofia, 6, and Mia, 2, and pug, Bella, after a four-day journey fleeing Irpin and leaving her husband at the border, her relief to be safe was palpable, but her thoughts were for her black Labrador, Clode, too big to fit in their car.  She showed me photos of Clode looking mournful as they left him lying on his own in front of the sofa. Sasha said: ""It is hard to look at these photos.""  They left house keys with a neighbour and asked him to put out food and water for Clode, but Sasha did not know the neighbour well and with Kharkiv under bombardment, she couldn't be sure if Clode was still alive. ""I am not sure I will see him again,"" she said. ""We brought Bella but Clode was part of our family. I feel I betrayed him.""  At a nearby refugee reception centre in Lodyna just over the Polish border, a young girl arrived with her mother after a long journey from eastern Ukraine and the first thing she did after being given a camp-bed was to feed and cuddle the rats in her pet carrier.  They immediately became a focal point and a way of connecting to other refugee children in the shelter. Elsewhere we saw several hamsters and even mice.  At the cavernous Bok Stadium in Budapest, a national sports centre being used as a filtration point for thousands of refugees arriving at Budapest train station, one of the charities was Animal Aid.   The Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here .  They had set up a stand offering free pet food, professional advice and veterinary information.  A spokesman said: ""Ninety-nine per cent of the pets people have brought are dogs and cats, but we are seeing the odd rat.""  He held up a pet carrier with a very busy white rat that somebody had found abandoned and handed in just minutes before.  ""It's in good shape,"" he said. ""The cage is clean and well looked after. We don't know if it was left behind on purpose or accidentally.""  Other refugees were letting their canine pets stretch their legs and as they strutted across the blue floor of the sports centre alongside their owners, they looked as happy and well looked after as contestants for a Crufts international dog show at Alexandra Palace.  Initially the EU had imposed no limits on the number of pets refugees could take with them, and border officers allowed them to cross without papers, but according to anecdotal reports from aid volunteers, limits have now been imposed, not just at the Ukrainian border but in some onward countries, and this had led to a rise in pets being abandoned at the border.  Hester Berg, a volunteer who since the war began has driven four times from her home in Vienna to various points on the Ukrainian border to deliver a car full of pet food, said: ""Refugees have told us that they have changed the laws regarding pets. Initially you could have five animals per car but now they've cut down so some refugees are having to make a choice at the border between which pets to take and which to leave behind. In other cases, they get their pets through the Ukrainian border only to face a limit at the second EU country they enter. We have rescued 25 dogs at various border crossings. It's heart-breaking.""  The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

The MS Victoria , which is docked in Leith, Edinburgh , will continue to provide “safe accommodation for displaced people” until June 2023 with the option to extend. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, however, accused the Scottish Government of “quietly” extending the contract, according to reports by LBC on Friday. On Friday evening, Mr Cole-Hamilton told the PA news agency: “This isn’t a new life, it’s a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution. “I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish Government as being humiliatingly underprepared. “They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork. “I don’t think when these Ukrainians are fleeing unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the Russians, I don’t think they dreamed about a very crowded passenger ship.” Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified. Minister with Special Responsibility for Refugees from Ukraine Neil Gray said: “We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary welcome accommodation, however, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community. “We’ve extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships. “Across Scotland work is under way to increase the availability of suitable and sustainable longer-term accommodation. The Scottish Government continues to work closely with local authority partners to increase longer-term housing opportunities for displaced people across Scotland. “We’ve provided up to £50 million of funding for local authorities and registered social landlords to bring void properties back into use and increase the available housing supply. “This includes the recent allocation of more than £6 million from the Ukraine Longer Term Resettlement Fund to Aberdeen City Council to bring around 500 void properties back into use.” The Scottish Government has urged members of the public to volunteer as hosts for refugees from Ukraine currently in short-term accommodation. Mr Gray added: “We would encourage anyone considering becoming a host to come forward and provide a warm welcome. In recognition of this commitment, hosts can receive thank you payments for up to 12 months. “I’m extremely grateful to people who are already hosting, as well as those who have already put their details forward and are still waiting to be matched. “I’m proud of the warm welcome the people of Scotland have given to those fleeing the war and the support we are providing to so many thousands of people.” More than 21,500 people with a Scottish sponsor have arrived in the country since the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, representing 20% of all UK arrivals. The ship is currently accommodating around 1,275 refugees including families and children. All options are being explored with the MS Ambition which is currently docked in Glasgow and has been chartered until February 2023.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-12",0,"Conditions"

More than 300 new listings have been made under the UK's sanctions regimes, targeting those well-connected with Russia's leader. An update to the Gov.uk website on Tuesday said that 350 new listings had been made under the Russia sanctions regime. The Foreign Office later said Ms Truss was to announce more than 370 ""Russian and Belarussian sanctions"", bringing the total number of individuals, entities, and subsidiaries put under strict measures to over 1,000 since the invasion of Ukraine began. It is understood the new additions will bring the UK in line with restrictive measures already announced by the European Union and by other allies. The list of those sanctioned has been expanded to include a further 51 Russian oligarchs and their families, plus a raft of politicians and ""propagandists"". These include Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and former President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev. Vladimir Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova are also on the list, as is internet 'troll farm', the Internet Research Agency. Russian oligarchs now subject to UK sanctions include Mikhail Fridman, Pyotr Aven, and German Khan. The Foreign Office said the oligarchs sanctioned on Tuesday have a combined estimated worth of more than £100 billion. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin - from major oligarchs, to his Prime Minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia's crimes in Ukraine. ""Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine."" Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he welcomed Western sanctions but they ""are not enough"" to end the Russian aggression, calling for a full trade embargo. Boris Johnson, who was hosting a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force nations in London which was addressed by Mr Zelensky via video-link, said: ""I hear your point very loud and clear about the economic sanctions that we need to tighten, where we need to go harder on the banks, on Swift."" Further general economic sanctions were also announced on Tuesday, with the export of high-end luxury products to Russia being banned and import tariffs hiked on hundreds of goods, including vodka. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: ""This is shutting the door after the private jet has bolted. The Government has finally got their act together - but we should have been in this position weeks ago. This delay has given Putin's cronies a priceless window to fire-sale their assets. ""Now we need to go further. There are still too many associates of Putin getting away with it as we speak. ""The fix to sanctions legislation is good news - but it means we can merely copy what our allies do. Liz Truss should bring proposals to Parliament to strengthen the legislation even further, so we can truly lead the way in clamping down on Kremlin-linked oligarchs."" It comes as the Home Office said 4,600 visas had been issued so far under the Ukraine Family Scheme, while nearly 90,000 British households had put themselves forward to take in Ukrainian refugees. Some 88,712 households had registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme by Tuesday morning, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. Earlier, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said he was ""actually quite proud"" the website allowing Britons to volunteer had crashed within the first few minutes of going live on Monday.

Moved by the plight of Ukrainian refugees desperate to escape Russian bombardment across the former Soviet republic, Marco Burstein, 18, of Los Angeles , and Avi Schiffman, 19, of Seattle , used their coding skills to create UkraineTakeShelter.com over three frenzied days in early March. Since then, more than 18,000 prospective hosts have signed up on the site to offer assistance to refugees seeking matches with hosts in their preferred or convenient locations. On a recent day, Burstein and Schiffman logged 800,000 users. ""We've heard all sorts of amazing stories of hosts and refugees getting connected all over the world,"" Burstein said in an interview on the Harvard campus. ""We have hosts in almost any country you can imagine from Hungary and Romania and Poland to Canada to Australia. And we've been really blown away by the response."" Five weeks into the invasion that has left thousands dead on both sides, the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country topped a staggering 4 million, half of them children, according to the United Nations. Schiffman, who's been taking a semester off to work on several projects, said from Miami he was inspired to use his internet activism to help after attending a pro-Ukraine rally in San Diego. ""I felt that I could really do something on a more global scale here,"" he said. ""Ukraine Take Shelter puts the power back into the hands of the refugee ... they're able to take the initiative and find the listings and get in contact with hosts by themselves instead of having to freeze on a curb in Eastern Europe in the wintertime."" Among those who have taken in refugees through the website is Rickard Mijarov, a resident of the southwestern Swedish city of Linkoping who's sharing his home with 45-year-old Ukrainian evacuee Oksana Frantseva, her 18-year-old daughter and their cat. Mijarov and his wife signed up at an embassy indicating they'd help, but then stumbled upon the Harvard students' site and registered there as well. ""The next morning, I had a message from Oksana asking if we had place for them,"" he said in an interview via Zoom. ""It became reality quite fast."" ""I was surprised how quickly Rickard answered to me,"" Frantseva said in halting English. Five days later, she, her daughter and their pet were at the front door. Burstein and Schiffman designed the platform with combat refugees' particular concerns in mind. They worked to make it as easy to use as possible so someone in immediate danger can enter their location and see the offers of help that are closest to them. On the hosting side, they also gave prospective hosts the opportunity to indicate what languages they speak; how many refugees they can accommodate; and any restrictions on taking in young children or pets. To help avoid human trafficking and other hazards that vulnerable refugees face, the platform encourages evacuees to ask hosts to provide their full names and social media profiles, and request a video call to show what accommodations they're offering. ""We know that this is potentially a dangerous situation, so we have a lot of steps in place to ensure the protection of our refugees,"" Burstein said. ""We have a detailed guide that we give to all refugees to help them verify the host that they're talking to - make sure that the person that they may be speaking with on the phone is the same one that they're meeting up with in person."" The two students say they're trying to arrange a meeting with officials from the U.N. refugee agency, and they are also looking to work with Airbnb, Vrbo and other online vacation rental companies. So far, they've borne all the expenses - a hardship for college students - for web hosting and Google Translate costs. But they're determined to continue as long as possible and are looking into registering as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit so they can apply for grants. Back in Sweden, Mijarov admits it was a bit unnerving to open his home, but he has no regrets. ""It's the first time we are doing something like this,"" he said, seated next to Frantseva.

Hundreds of people fleeing the war-torn country are set to be shunted into temporary accommodation on the MS Victoria I, currently berthed in Leith, Edinburgh. But with Covid cases spreading across Scotland, a leading expert has warned the Scottish Government would be ""bloody lucky"" if there is no major virus outbreak on the vessel. Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, said: ""It's a very risky move. The number of outbreaks of Covid that happened on ships is very large. ""I would say there's a real risk that if Covid gets into that ship and there's a fairly large number of people on board, you might have quite a big outbreak. ""It's not just an issue of being on a passenger ship, it's the close proximity people have. ""The ventilation system on the ship may have something to do with it as well. ""Somebody might be in a confined space but breathing out and the air gets round. ""You can't really ask people to sit there with the doors all closed. I think they are running a very real risk."" Professor Pennington said vaccination checks, testing passengers and imposing the wearing of face masks would be the ""basic minimum"" measures to take. He also warned symptomless patients could carry the virus aboard without noticing and urged the Government not to house vulnerable people over the age of 65. Professor Pennington added: ""I suppose the main problem is that you've got these people that you've got to put somewhere. ""I think they'd be bloody lucky to avoid having the outbreak on the ship with Omicron as it is and Scotland being the number one in the UK in terms of infections."" The 190-metre-long ship can accommodate up to 2,500 passengers, and boasts more than 700 cabins. Prior to the ship's latest commission, the vessel sailed through the Baltic sea on leisure trips. Up to 10,000 Ukrainians are understood to have arrived in Scotland since Russia's invasion in February. The Scottish Government recently announced that approximately 730 of them will live aboard MS Victoria after shelving their flagship ""super sponsor scheme"". The solution is meant to be temporary while permanent housing is being made ready. Ukraine's consul general in Scotland warned Nicola Sturgeon that refugees should not be left to languish in cabins. Yevhen Mankovskyi, who is planning to inspect the ship next week, said: ""I don't want people to live for six months on the ship, no one wants this."" A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""Safeguarding the health of displaced people on the passenger ship is our priority, as it is in other temporary accommodation such as hotels.

Speaking on RTE, he said: ""We're 17 days into a war and our initial priority is to get people shelter. The quickest way to do that is to book places in hotels. ""We're planning for the medium term as well, and a lot of the integration supports that need to happen in the medium to long term will follow where the accommodation is.

She misses her boyfriend and her family but more importantly she believes that after nearly three months away she has a duty to be back in her home country. ""I've got an opportunity to live and work safely in England in a very difficult moment, but I feel that I'll be more useful in Ukraine and for Ukraine,"" she said. ""I believe that I'm from that generation that will rebuild Ukraine after we win the war. Every refugee that comes back home will help to make Ukraine a better place. ""I'm inspired with experience of life in a highly developed country, where anyone can open a new business, anyone can become a politician and anyone can just work fair and hard to create a strong and happy country. All Ukrainians who will come back home, including me, will make their contribution to the future prosperity of Ukraine."" Markovets, who goes by the name Kate in England, has been living in rural Cheshire since June. Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme 84,000 Ukrainian refugees have moved in with 25,000 British households since March. Her hosts, Dave and Liz Robinson, have treated her like their own daughter, making sure that they eat their evening meal together, giving her lifts and checking that she is safe when she is out. ""Kate had asked us to send some information about where she would be staying to her mum, which we did and promised to take good care of her,"" Dave Robinson said. ""Consequently we have treated her as one of our children so, perhaps, have been overprotective at times, being ready to give lifts and checking that she is safe when she has gone on trips away."" The past three months have been an education for the pair of them too as they have learnt a lot about Ukrainian customs, culture and food. ""It has been quite embarrassing to admit how little we knew about Ukraine before the current conflict,"" he said. Markovets has introduced them to traditional Ukrainian dishes, including borscht, which is a beetroot soup, and mlyntsi, a stuffed pancake dish. The Robinsons have also got to know their own local area better as a result of Markovets staying, which has forced them out of their normal routines to find new pubs, villages and churches to visit. They have taken her on days out to Liverpool and Wales, hiked to the top of Snowdon and arranged trips for her to London, Edinburgh and Birmingham. She said: ""Edinburgh has some magical atmosphere. I was there during the Fringe festival so the city seems to me very alive, bright but still cosy."" Rural Cheshire feels a million miles away from her home town of Sarny, about 25 miles from the border with Belarus. She experienced war firsthand while she was visiting her parents there from Kyiv when Russian missiles began hitting the town in February. The nature of her work as a freelance digital marketing manager for Ukrainian businesses has enabled her to continue her work remotely. She had no prior connection with the Robinsons. They met on a website called Opora that matched refugees with UK hosts. They had produced a PowerPoint presentation to show refugees what they had to offer. Fast-forward three months and the three of them are sad to be saying farewell. Markovets has made so many friends locally that she spent all day saying goodbye to people as they popped in throughout the day on Saturday, her birthday, and more came to dinner in the evening. The government has appealed for more volunteers as a quarter of existing ones have said that they can no longer host refugees beyond the initial sixmonth period that they signed up for. As Markovets returns home tomorrow, another refugee, Nazarii, is preparing to finally fly the other way after waiting five months for the Home Office to issue his visa. Despite matching with a UK host family in Church Crookham, Hampshire, back in March, his visa application has hit numerous obstacles and repeated delays because he is 17, which makes him a minor. Until July the Home Office did not allow unaccompanied minors to come to the UK. He is now waiting for his 18th birthday, on September 11, before a fast-tracked visa can be issued. Nazarii is looking forward to coming to England, although he will be sad to leave behind his father, who is a doctor, and mother, who has to stay in Ukraine to look after his grandmother. He said: ""This territory is not so dangerous as the eastern regions but isn't safe, because it's the war in the whole of Ukraine versus Russia and we don't know what this stupid terrorist state will do tomorrow."" Despite never having met his UK hosts, Sam and Tim Read and their son, Theo, who is also 17, Nazarii already sees them as family. ""I have been communicating with my brilliant sponsor family for almost five months and at this time I have realised that British people are very kind and ready to help Ukrainians like an older brother. We all are very grateful for the UK."" The Reads said that the experience had made them lose all faith in the Home Office. ""We opened our hearts and promised his family to keep him safe and care for him as if he was one of our children,"" Sam Read said. ""So if it hadn't worked we would not have opened ourselves up for more upset. I've also lost faith in the Home Office. The wait for Nazarii and his family has caused them stress they didn't need."" Not all hosts and their refugees have got on without hiccups under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. For David and Nancy, they are beginning to get a little fed up with their refugee, Olena, a 36-year-old woman who is on holiday in Croatia. It had been a ""largely positive experience"" having her to stay in their north London home, Nancy said, but they believe she needs to get out of the house more. ""She has been here almost seven weeks now and we feel it's time for her to get a job here,"" Nancy said. ""She has applied for universal credit and got it. She still does some work for her company in Ukraine, but we feel it's time to engage in London working life, not wait another two months, as is her plan, when she will have completed her English classes. ""We had thought she would be out of the house Monday to Friday 9 to 5ish most days but now that isn't the case it does impinge a bit on our daily lives and is starting to get a bit annoying. Working at the kitchen table on her laptop is a bit intrusive day after day."" The couple do not regret signing up for the scheme, but they say they will need to sit down with Olena to discuss her plans if she intends to stay beyond the initial six months to which they committed. They have not yet received a penny of the £350 monthly ""thank you"" payment that the government has promised hosts, and hope that it starts being paid soon to help to pay for rising living costs.

That represents a tenth of the 12,500 visas granted under the programme since it began three weeks ago. A further 31,000 Ukrainians are waiting for their visa to be granted by the Home Office having completed forms to connect them with their UK hosts. Under the separate family scheme, little over a third of the 28,500 Ukrainians issued visas have arrived. In total, 12,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to the UK since the war began on February 24. The home secretary told the BBC: ""It's been frustrating. I apologise with frustration myself. I'll be candid, it has taken time. Any new visa system takes time."" The numbers arriving in the UK are significantly lower than in its EU neighbours, which do not require visa checks for Ukrainians. Ireland said this week that 20,000 had arrived. France had seen 30,000 enter the country by a week ago while the German government said it had accepted 300,000 Ukrainians. Patel defended the government's decision to insist on keeping visa requirements despite 4.3 million Ukrainians fleeing the war. ""We are an independent third country and we want to give people the status and security of coming to our country along with the warm welcome,"" she said. ""We have to ensure that they are protected and safeguarded in the United Kingdom as well."" In total, the UK has received 80,000 visa applications under the family scheme and Homes for Ukraine scheme. The Home Office has granted 28,500 visas out of 36,300 applications under the family scheme, But only 10,800 have arrived in the UK. The UK has issued 12,500 visas out of 43,600 applications under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, where UK households match with Ukrainian refugees to accommodate them. Just 1,200 have arrived, or 9.6 per cent of those issued visas. More than 200,000 UK households have registered an interest in the scheme.

Enver Solomon, head of the Refugee Council, reiterated calls for the government to ditch visa requirements and said the schemes were ""unfit for purpose"".

Cammy Day said he was shocked to be informed by UK government officials that MS Victoria, home to thousands of Ukrainian refugees for the past year while docked in Leith, is to be repurposed for asylum seekers. While it has not been confirmed that the vessel will remain in Leith, it is understood that the port is one of a number under consideration by the Home Office to provide a temporary home for asylum seekers. At its peak last year MS Victoria housed 1,498 people from Ukraine, mostly women and children, who had fled the Russian invasion. All will have moved out by July 11 as a contract ends between the Scottish government and Landry & Kling, the project managers who ran the facility. It is understood that discussions between the Home Office and Landry & Kling have been going on for several weeks without the knowledge of the council, the Scottish government and Forth Ports, the dock owners. Day said the city had shown ""solidarity"" with the Ukranians, but he was ""extremely surprised"" by the Home Office decision to use the ship to house asylum seekers. He said: ""The potential consequences for the council in terms of the pressures on our services - and the city as a whole - are severe and we will continue to oppose these plans in the strongest terms. ""While the MS Victoria has been a place of refuge for many Ukrainian families arriving in Edinburgh, until we have adequate reassurances from the UK government regarding the welfare and ongoing engagement and support, we cannot allow it to become a floating prison for asylum seekers."" Edinburgh schools and NHS facilities have been placed under severe strain by the sudden influx of refugees. The latest statistics show 496 Ukrainian children enrolled in local schools, with GP surgeries and health visiting services also affected. However, over the past year the ship, which has extensive community and children's facilities and a Ukrainian restaurant, has broadly been praised by politicians and NGOs who visited it. Joyce Landry, the chief executive of Landry & Kling, said those who are likely to live on the ship will not be new arrivals but will have passed the first stage of the asylum process enabling them eventually to settle in the UK. She dismissed the notion that Victoria was a ""prison ship"" and said it would prove beneficial for those who lived aboard. She said: ""People are free to come and go, participate in activities and practise their faith. As we have shown with the Ukrainians, having everyone together is very beneficial in terms of providing English classes, healthcare and the support people need to integrate them into the country."" Humza Yousaf, the first minister, said he had taken up the case with Michael Gove, the communities secretary. The Home Office said it was working with local authorities across the UK to disperse ""fairly"" asylum seekers across the UK and end ""the unacceptable use of hotels"".

Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said that full DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks would not be needed for thousands of people signing up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Individuals and organisations who register to sponsor refugees will be checked against the Police National Computer to protect refugees from exploitative individuals taking advantage of the scheme. There was confusion after Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told Times Radio earlier yesterday that hosts would have ""DBS-style checks"". MPs warned that the lack of a full DBS check on individuals raised serious safeguarding concerns, given the government was suggesting that British households could use social media to match with Ukrainians. Hosts must match up with a Ukrainian refugee or family themselves before submitting a joint visa application with the named individuals. Although hosts could register their interest yesterday, visa applications for the scheme do not open until Friday. Gove said that local authorities, which will be given £10,500 per refugee resettled in their area, would be able to spot signs of abuse. Sponsors would be visited by safeguarding professionals from local government, but only after the Ukrainian refugees had moved in with their UK sponsor. With more than 35,000 households signing up in the first five hours of the scheme opening, there were concerns over how long and how thorough the checks would be. Government sources said that teachers, doctors and nurses would act as an ""additional check"" for problems such as domestic abuse. Announcing the scheme, Gove told MPs: ""We do not believe that we need to have full DBS checks to ensure that someone is an appropriate sponsor. Very light-touch criminal checks will often be sufficient, and then local authorities can be supported to ensure that people are safe."" Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced yesterday that he would offer to accommodate a Ukraini- an refugee in his home. Gove's hopes of housing a refugee have been complicated because he lives in Carlton Gardens, a grace-and-favour residence, since separating from his wife, Sarah Vine, last year. Security concerns are preventing him from hosting refugees at the apartment. It is normally the foreign secretary's official London residence but Liz Truss offered it to him after he moved out of his family home. Aides said that he is more likely to use his constituency home in Surrey Heath to accommodate refugees. Priti Patel is unlikely to host refugees because of security concerns over living with a home secretary, while Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would not be taking any Ukrainian refugees in. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said that it was up to individual ministers whether they chose to give accommodation to a refugee. ""There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10,"" he said. ""Obviously it will come down to individual circumstances. This is a significant commitment."" Javid said that it would be difficult to ""offer the time"" to host Ukrainian refugees in his home. He said it was important that those who offered to become a host could spend time with resettled families. Separately, the government announced emergency measures yesterday to allow all Ukrainian refugees to bring their pets into the UK. The government will cover the cost of any quarantine required. Animal welfare groups had warned that cats and dogs travelling with refugees might have to be euthanised unless the UK relaxed rules on pet travel. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We have put in place a new streamlined process for people bringing their pets from Ukraine. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will provide quick approvals and relevant quarantine arrangements, for which we will cover the costs."" An RSPCA spokeswoman said: ""We're pleased that for refugees coming to the UK they won't have the added heartbreak of leaving their pets behind."" Letters, page 24 Scheme will work only if charities are in driving seat, leading article, page 25 Q&A What is the new scheme announced yesterday? Homes for Ukraine allows individuals, businesses, charities and community groups to bring people escaping the war to safety even if they have no ties to the UK. Who can sign up? Anyone with a room or home available can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family as long as they can commit to at least six months. Does the host have to be living in the property? No. Will hosts be vetted? Yes, but only ""very light-touch"" checks will be carried out as the government wants to get as many refugees matched as soon as possible. Hosts will be checked against the police national computer to detect exploitative individuals. Will hosts' homes be checked? Yes, sponsors will be visited by safeguarding professionals from the local authority to assess whether the property and individuals are appropriate after those who have moved in. How do hosts sign up? By filling out a form at www.homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk. Hosts are asked whether they can offer sixnine months, 10-12 months, or more than 12 months. They can sign up to accommodate a single adult, multiple adults or families and can also offer a number of properties. What happens next? After hosts have passed basic security checks, they must name an individual or family they wish to accommodate in a separate visa application form that they can fill in from Friday. How do hosts and refugees get matched? UK hosts are responsible for finding the Ukrainians and must name individuals or families they want to bring to the UK. This will rely on UK hosts having connections, or finding refugees through social networks on or offline. Organisations such as the Sanctuary Foundation have set up a consortium of bodies that will help match hosts with refugees. What if hosts cannot find a refugee to sponsor? They will have to wait until the second phase of the scheme is launched within the next few weeks. They can register their interest on the same form as above. How long can refugees stay? Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years' leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services. What checks will be carried out on Ukrainians? Those with Ukrainian passports will be allowed to apply online and travel to the UK without attending a visa centre but must submit their biometric details at a centre in the UK within six months of arriving. Is there any compensation? Those offering a place to stay will receive an optional tax-free monthly payment of £350 which will not affect benefit entitlements or council tax status. Councils will be entitled to £10,500 per Ukrainian refugee. Hosts must not charge any rent. How many have applied? There were over 44,000 offers in the first six hours.

It confirmed that the contract to use the MS Ambition, which is docked near Glasgow, would come to an end on March 31. Neil Gray, the minister with special responsibility for refugees from Ukraine, said use of the vessel - home to about 1,170 Ukrainians, including 420 children - was always intended to be a temporary measure. He added that the Scottish government would look to make ""full use"" of both existing and new volunteer hosts to provide somewhere to stay for the refugees. The announcement that its use was being ended came after ministers last month extended the contract for another ship being used to house refugees, the MS Victoria which is docked outside Edinburgh, for a further five months. The cruise liner is docked in Leith and is housing about 1,275 Ukrainians. Gray said: ""The MS Ambition was a temporary measure.

The government is expected to announce plans to use half a dozen holiday parks, which are anticipated to be available from January once talks about the length of leases have concluded. Ministers also want to expand the use of old university halls of residence to cut the need for hotels. One such site already housing migrants is the former Canterbury Christ Church University building in Broadstairs, Kent. Disused military bases similar to the RAF site at Manston, which was turned into a processing centre, are also being considered as a ""long-term"" solution. The government believes that using old student halls and empty holiday camps would be a ""win-win"" because they would be cheaper than hotels. Several local councils, including in Rishi Sunak's own constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire, have moved homeless people and Ukrainian refugees out of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The issue is also becoming politically toxic, with many Tory MPs objecting to the use of hotels in their areas. A government source said: ""Student accommodation and disused holiday camps are not going to attract the same kind of criticism."" Albanian people smugglers have urged migrants to pay for crossings this week due to ""calm"" conditions. One Continued on page 2 continued from page 1 Migrant accommodation post on TikTok offered prices of (EURO)3,000 for a small boat crossing and promised a maximum of 27 people on board. In contrast, it said journeys in the back of a lorry would cost (EURO)20,000. More than 44,000 migrants have crossed the Channel this year and officials believe there are about 6,000 people who want to make the journey in the coming weeks, which could take this year's total to more than 50,000. At the weekend Lee Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, appeared to issue a veiled threat to quit the party if illegal immigration was not tackled. Writing in the Mail on Sunday he said: ""If this isn't solved within the first three months of 2023, we will struggle to retain the red wall and my conscience will be severely tested because I want to stand as a Conservative candidate representing a party that will put the interests of my constituents before the thousands of illegal immigrants arriving here every month."" David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, told Times Radio that the Tories would lose the next election if they failed to grip the issue. ""It won't matter whether Lee [Anderson] stands as a Tory or anything else, he won't get elected,"" he said. ""None of us will."" He said that Albania should be declared a ""safe country"" so claims could be fast-tracked. ""If they do that, it won't solve the whole problem,"" he said. ""But it will take a third of it out. And it means the rest becomes manageable."" During the Tory leadership campaign in the summer, Sunak pledged to ""deliver thousands of new beds through a range of existing and novel solutions, including the use of cruise ships"".
