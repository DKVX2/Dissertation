The minister said Government must increase homes being built and cut the legal entry of people. This comes after net migration has hit new records. More than a million people came to Britain to live in the past year as the Government faces political pressure to reduce arrivals. Asked if the UK did not have the number of homes to match the demand from immigrants, the Housing Secretary told Times Radio: ""Migratory flows put more pressure on housing but we haven't built enough homes overall for generations. ""This Government is going to hit its target of a million new homes in this Parliament but we do need to go further. This year, I outlined a long-term plan for housing, which will allow us to build more homes, particularly making effective use of brownfield land."" With net migration of 745,000 last year, the Government would need to massively increase housebuilding and significantly reduce immigration to meet the challenge, he said. Mr Gove added: ""It's important when looking at the migration figures to recognise some of these figures are students, some are Ukrainian refugees, some are British nationals from Hong Kong. ""But we need to bring migration down. And we need to build more homes.""

But a fortnight later, the Levelling Up Secretary is still fighting to overcome resistance to his idea from the Treasury and Foreign Office, where officials shiver at what one source dismissed as 'banana republic politics'. For their part, supporters of Mr Gove's plan describe the opponents as 'oligarch apologists'. The debate flared up again last week at the first meeting of a Cabinet sub-committee on Ukraine, chaired by Downing Street's chief of staff Steve Barclay, which has been tasked with examining 'every facet' of the UK's refugee response. When Mr Gove highlighted the powerful symbolism of his proposed move, Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly and Treasury Minister John Glen voiced their departments' reservations. Under Mr Gove's plan, British property owned by oligarchs sanctioned because of the war would be taken over by the Government for as long as they remained on the list, allowing Ministers to throw open their doors to refugees. In the case of Roman Abramovich, Britain's most high-profile oligarch, that would release at least 70 properties, worth around £500million, The portfolio includes a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens with an estimated value of £150 million, and a three-storey penthouse in the Chelsea Waterfront tower, bought for £30million in 2018. Abramovich had his assets - including Chelsea FC - frozen on Thursday as part of Government sanctions. Another sanctioned oligarch, aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska, worth £2 billion, owns a £50million property on Belgrave Square in Central London, via a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, and Hamstone House on the exclusive St George's Hill estate near Weybridge, Surrey. The eight-bedroom mansion includes a swimming pool, sauna, gym and extensive gardens. Mr Gove's plan echoes moves by the US Congress to seize assets from oligarchs whose wealth is linked to Vladimir Putin. Under a bill introduced earlier this month, American authorities would be allowed to go further than Mr Gove's plan by confiscating, rather than just seizing, any property - including luxury villas, yachts, and airplanes - valued more than $5million with the funds used to benefit the Ukrainian people via military or humanitarian aid. Supporters of Mr Gove's plan also point the finger at No10's new head of policy, Andrew Griffith, for trying to block it. Mr Griffith, the Arundel MP, is a former Rothschild banker and chief financial officer for Sky TV, who is understood to have argued that the idea is not 'legally workable'. An opponent of the Gove plan said: 'This is gesture politics more suited to a banana republic'. But a supporter said: 'The opposition is being led by oligarch apologists who hide behind the rule of law. These people have been sanctioned for a reason, and no one who has been placed on the sanctions list has ever come off it. This is the ultimate symbolic payback for Putin's cronies.' Downing Street declined to comment and a spokesman for Mr Gove said: 'We don't comment on private Cabinet discussions.'

Envelopes enclosing around 70,000 cheques which were sent to the Mail Force appeal are being donated to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) so that the stamps can go towards raising funds for its lifesaving research work. Dozens of bags full of envelopes have been delivered to the charity's headquarters in Leeds and volunteers will cut out the stamps, which will be sorted and sold in bulk by weight. The trust receives up to £20 a kilogram by selling the stamps to amateur and professional collectors across the country. Collectors will often buy large bags of stamps to look for certain postmarks. Unusual stamps and ones with slight defects can also be snapped up by collectors to improve their private collections. Envelopes donated for previous Mail Force appeals to raise funds for computers for children and to buy personal protective equipment for frontline health workers were also passed on to the cancer charity. The Ukraine refugee appeal was kick-started with £500,000 from DMGT, the Mail's parent company, at the request of Lord and Lady Rothermere, and has raised more than £11.5million so far. Laura Riach, the cancer charity's head of fundraising and communications, said: 'We would like to thank the Daily Mail for donating their used stamps to the Bone Cancer Research Trust's Stamp Appeal. We will turn these stamps into vital funds for our life-saving work, which will truly make a difference to all those affected by primary bone cancer. Last year our Stamp Appeal raised an incredible £11,835.' About 560 people are diagnosed with primary bone cancer in the UK every year, with around 355 annual deaths.

Sally Becker, who helped rescue hundreds of people from war-torn Bosnia, has 'grave concerns' for the women and children after their paperwork was rejected by British officials. The 58-year-old said she set off on the mission to save orphaned youngsters and mothers with the full acknowledgement of the British Government last month. She said many of the refugees came from areas where there was fierce fighting. They had made a 22-hour train journey, collecting more children en route who escaped from places like Mariupol, before crossing into Poland. But when they were ready to travel to the UK, Mrs Becker says the Home Office asked for more evi- dence that the Ukrainian government had sanctioned the evacuation. As a result, their flight booked for yesterday had to be cancelled. She now says the group has just days to find a solution or will have 'nowhere to go', adding: 'I'm completely dependent on the British Government to help me bring these children to a safe haven in the UK. 'We've got grandmothers given custody of children because their parents have either been killed or had to fight. We have children who have been deprived of parents since birth. Many are extremely vulnerable and really need help.' Mrs Becker explained how she set off for Dnipro at the end of April. At that point, she claimed there was no problem obtaining permission to bring the children to the UK. She gathered 167 refugees and negotiated safe passage to the Polish border through the Ukrainian government. She said they 'arranged for three carriages to be attached to the train especially for the children'. Mrs Becker said plans are in place to allow the refugees to stay at two hotels on the Wirral, Merseyside, with a six-month stay funded by The Steve Morgan Foundation. It's understood Ukraine's deputy prime minister has written to minister for refugees Lord Harrington confirming they have been aware of her mission since April 22. A Home Office spokesman said last night: 'We can only give permission for an unaccompanied child to travel where we are certain they will have appropriate support and care once they are here. We are speaking to Sally Becker and the authorities in Ukraine to reach a solution.' Graphic   Plea: Sally with orphans in Poland","Tabloid",1,"2022-05",1,"Aid"

This is the basis of the witty and clever plan put forward by the Cabinet Minister Michael Gove. He proposes that the British Government seizes the huge London homes of Russian oligarchs who have been friendly to Vladimir Putin - and uses them to house Ukrainian refugees. The planned takeover would be temporary, for as long as the oligarchs are sanctioned and for as long as those refugees need roofs over their heads. These grotesquely wealthy businessmen have obtained their riches through dubious methods and by prostrating themselves before the despotic power of the Kremlin. They have in almost all cases been careful to stash their wealth out of Putin's reach, in a free law-governed country quite unlike the one where they made their fortunes. Well, now they may find out that democracy can be ruthless too, especially when faced with greed in alliance with www.aggression.No doubt there will be legal problems to surmount. That is quite proper in a law-governed country such as we are - and such as Russia is not. The aim of the scheme is not to expropriate or nationalise these properties. It is to do something practical and just with them, as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians seek decent shelter, many of them in this country. Imagine for the moment how such a refugee family might feel if, instead of being placed in a bleak hotel or a church hall, they were installed amid the high ceilings and gold-plated bath taps of some Russian plutocrat. And imagine also how the billionaires might feel, to see their palaces handed over to the deserving and suffering victims of a regime they have until now supported. It might cause them to rethink their allegiance. The idea may seem outrageous at first sight but it deserves careful consideration.","Tabloid",1,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

The Angel Inn in Midhurst, West Sussex, was among several buildings engulfed by the early morning blaze. There were no reports of casualties. Resident Hilton Holloway said about 30 people, including children, were evacuated from the hotel. 'There were a number of Ukrainian refugees in the hotel, which had around 15 rooms,' Mr Holloway said. 'I spoke to one young woman who seemed relatively calm.'

A senior council worker responsible for her local refugee scheme is concerned there will be 'a massive abuse case' due to a lack of safeguarding measures to protect evacuees. The whistleblower said more than one in four of the 40 matches passed from the Home Office to her local authority are between men aged over 50 and women in their twenties or early thirties. Experts have warned the British government visa scheme - in which would-be hosts are matched with Ukrainians seeking refuge - could become 'Tinder for sex traffickers'. One housing charity claimed the scheme was being exploited before it opened, with young women offered 'arrangements' in exchange for accommodation. It comes as female Ukrainian refugees described being harassed by men online after posting on Facebook groups in search of a sponsor. Last night politicians and chari- ties urged the Government to close 'dangerous loopholes' and put proper safeguarding measures in place to prevent vulnerable refugees being exploited. On Friday the Government launched a matching scheme - linking UK sponsors with Ukrainian refugees - despite warnings that predators could exploit the initiative. But it comes two weeks after the Homes for Ukraine scheme first opened for applications, meaning thousands of refugees have already been driven to use unregulated social media groups to find a sponsor. Once Ukrainians find a British host, they can apply for a visa. This is initially processed by the Home Office and then passed to the relevant local authority, which is responsible for ensuring the accommodation is fit for purpose. But the whistleblower, who works for a council in the Midlands, said she fears the scheme could become 'a completely assisted exploitation exercise'. While she is sure the majority of people offering their homes are doing so out of kindness, she is worried a minority may have ill intentions. The worker is concerned the results of Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks carried out on hosts will not come back before the Ukrainian refugees arrive, although Home Office sources said they would be 'expedited'. When an evacuee arrives in this country they will probably go straight to their host's home regardless of the status of the host's official approval, meaning it is possible that safeguarding issues will not be picked up in time, the whistleblower warned. The host, however, will not be able to claim the £350-per-month compensation until they have been vetted. The council worker said: 'All of this has been put on local authorities to make decisions without the right frameworks. And without that safety net, I can imagine that somehow this will go wrong. 'I worry there'll be a massive abuse case that happens within my local authority and it will be us who come under fire for failing safeguarding duties, when actually we did everything we possibly could.' The council staffer said there are an 'awful lot of very young, very beautiful girls' looking for a sponsor on platforms such as Facebook, and they are flooded with responses. 'It doesn't inspire confidence that these people are in it for the right reasons,' she added. Positive Action in Housing, a homelessness charity, said men had been targeting young Ukrainian women who posted on Facebook looking for information about the scheme. One 'host' claimed to be a doctor with a 'big empty house', and offered accommodation, food, expenses and a monthly allowance as part of an 'arrangement' - a term often used to imply sexual activity. Ukrainian evacuee, Olena, 25, found her sponsor through Facebook after posting a picture of herself along with some brief details. While she was overwhelmed by how many generous responses she received, she was also alarmed to receive messages from single men wanting to host her. One man wrote: 'I have a small space in my apartment... I am single and live alone. I hope it's not a problem. My apartment is small but I can help you or someone alone.' Another said: 'I live alone in a three-bedroom, three-floor house in central London and would be happy to help you with accommodation and anything else that you will need.' Some continued to message her even after she announced she had found a host, pressing for details of the address she would be moving to. A search on one Facebook group showed one man, who was single and offering a room in Weston-super- Mare, Somerset, had liked three posts in the group - all by women aged 23, 30 and 33. Labour peer Bar- oness Kennedy of Cradley said it is 'desperately worrying' that some women have been targeted online by men who have tried to 'coerce' information from them about their location. 'It is also worrying that councils are receiving matches via the Home Office between single men over 50 and single women in their 20s,' she added. 'The Government needs to ensure there are proper safeguards in place for all the women and girls fleeing war and seeking sanctuary here.' Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, said: 'So-called ""sponsors"" registered with Homes for Ukraine have gone on to social media to offer shelter for sex to war refugees. We expect to see much worse in the coming weeks and months.' Louise Calvey, from Refugee Action, said: 'We are concerned that issues with the scheme mean that it risks being a Tinder for sex traffickers.' A government spokesman said: 'We have designed our Homes for Ukraine scheme specifically to have safeguards in place - including robust security and background checks on all www.sponsors.No visa will be issued until the Home Office has completed checks on all adults in a sponsor's household as well as on the applicants from Ukraine. 'At the time of application, local authorities are notified to begin DBS checks, which will be expedited by the Home Office, so they can arrange in-person visits.'

AND BEGS FOR HELP BY IAN GALLAGHER CHIEF REPORTER The Les Kurbas Theatre in central Lviv would be playing to a packed house tonight if times were different. But instead of actors performing Anthony Horowitz's psychological thriller Mindgame, displaced Ukrainians occupy the stage. In fact, they sleep on it, their belongings grouped around camp beds. They also fill the stalls. And one woman even beds down on a balcony in the upper circle. It feels as though I've got the last bed in town,' says Lena Mazurkina, 33, a hairdresser who arrived at the theatre from bombed-out Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine yesterday. Lviv, 50 miles from the Polish border, is the relative safe haven for those fleeing the fighting in the east. But it is at bursting point. So much so that its mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, has issued a desperate plea for help. Lviv can no longer cope, he says. Roughly the size of Nottingham, the city has sheltered 200,000 women and children since the Russian invasion began two weeks ago. Finding a hotel room is near impossible. Apartments, too, are fully booked. Some 35,000 refugees sleep in empty schools - pupils were sent home when the fighting started - while thousands more find space in churches and sports stadiums. The exodus is unlikely to abate any time soon and, with barely an inch of the city left unclaimed, the mayor says huge tents with fully equipped kitchens are now needed to cope with new arrivals. Sometimes he feels as though responsibility for handling Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since the Second World War rests almost entirely on his shoulders. We really need support,' he says. Directing operations from his town hall office in historic Rynok Square, he rarely gets more than three hours' sleep a night. Hiding from bombings and missile strikes, the women and children left their homes and came to us - and 440 different institutions opened their doors, providing a roof over heads and hot food,' he says. Every day, there are more and more people coming in. It's our responsibility to accept everyone.' Mr Sadovyi isn't one to mince words. Last week he called on Boris Johnson to seize the villas of Russian oligarchs living in London and to use them to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. Now he has a blunt request for humanitarian organisations - of which precious few are visible in Lviv. We need your help. Not abroad, not on a border, but here. We need your experience. We have never encountered this before. Our citizens stay in Lviv because they believe we will win.' For the time being, assistance comes via the kindness of inspirational locals - some of whom have taken up weapons training to prepare against the Russian threat. Arriving in Lviv's main railway station, Miss Mazurkina and her mother bumped into some volunteers who told them about the theatre. I have to say it is the last place I expected to sleep,' she says. But it's warm and safe and much, much better than being in Kharkiv, hiding in shelters from bombs every night.' It has been two days since the last air raid siren in Lviv but when it is next sounded, Miss Mazurkina and her mother will find themselves sharing a shelter with props and scenery pushed to one side in the basement. In the foyer, a little boy plays on the piano as volunteers sort through bags of donated clothes. There is far too much of everything, but that's the Lvivites: Generous to a fault. It was one of the city's most famous actresses, Natalia Rybka-Parhomenko, 33, who decided to turn the theatre into a shelter when she saw the first reports of people fleeing. First she discussed her plan with her friend, the mayor's wife, who consulted her husband. He thought it a fine idea. I felt I had to do something,' says Natalia, a Kharkiv native who has performed at the Les Kurbas for the past 17 years. I am so very shocked by what has happened. A war such as this in the 21st century? My God, what have we become? We needed to find space for all these people fleeing from the east. The director here was in full agreement and so we turned the place into a refuge. There are 27 people here at the moment, mainly mothers and babies.' Pushing aside heavy red velvet curtains, Natalia leads us into the stalls, with seats removed to make way for beds. Food is stacked on trestle tables in the middle of the auditorium. At the end of one table, English teacher Tamila Kheladze, 32, from Kyiv, patiently feeds her 14-month-old son Dennis. Having said goodbye to her husband, a banker, she moved to her parents' village 50 miles from the city but moved further west, she says, when she heard reports of Russian soldiers executing people in the next village. I feel fortunate to be here in the theatre. When we arrived earlier this week the city was full up and I thought we might have to sleep in the cold at the station,' she says. My baby keeps me strong, gives me focus. If I didn't have him I would never have left Kyiv, I'd be at my husband's side doing whatever is necessary. They've said we can stay as long as we like here, but I plan to go to Sweden to stay with friends. My heart feels as if it is breaking a little every day but we will get through this, we will win.' Before we leave, Natalia tells us that Les Kurbas, the Ukrainian director who gives his name to the theatre, was persecuted during the Soviet era and, like other cultural figures, sent to a labour camp. Even there however, he still managed to organise a theatre group. There is something defiant about what we are doing here too,' she says. This weekend the curtain was due to go up on a new production, Suddenly Last Summer by Tennessee Williams. Who knows when we will open again,' says Natalia. But the actors have all agreed that when we do, it will be something happy - with lots of singing.' v © Daily Mail","Tabloid",1,"2022-03",0,"Conditions"

""One of the things that we'll examine over the next couple of weeks is how we can make sure that we have more appropriate and more robust border controls to make sure that people aren't able to enter the country illegally,"" he told reporters on January 11. ""The vast majority of people who come here from overseas do so legally. That's absolutely right. But those who don't, obviously, we have to protect against that."" Fast forward one month and the same conversations were taking place at a European level meeting in Brussels, this time against the backdrop of growing protests against the numbers of migrants arriving here. Varadkar has joined Austrian, Belgian, Danish and Dutch leaders in calling for tighter border controls. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has suggested ""fences"" in an echo of Donald Trump's border wall. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not be used to pay for fences. expel She did, however, announce that leaders agreed to new rules making it easier to expel people whose refugee applications are denied. If a person's asylum application is rejected in another EU member state, any other country in the bloc can use this decision to return a migrant to their home country. The discussions come at a time when Ireland is struggling to provide accommodation to International Protection seekers. Due to capacity constraints, Integration Minister Roderic O'Gorman was forced to close the Citywest Transit Hub to new single arrivals, leaving many without accommodation in winter. The latest figures from his Department show that there were a total of 194 arrivals for the week ending February 5, an average of 27 a day. This does not include Ukrainian refugees. Some 76 (39 per cent) were single males. These are the people who have been left without accommodation. Of the 19,741 asylum seekers in State-provided accommodation, 3,257 are from Georgia. Another 2,383 are from Nigeria, 2,050 are from Algeria and 1,853 are from Zimbabwe. They are from 47 different countries in total. Government sources believe that the increase is, in part, due to the UK's crackdown on asylum seekers. Shortly after the British government announced a plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, the number of refugees who arrived climbed so suddenly that people were left sleeping on the floor of Dublin Airport. It was one of many measures taken by the UK. It reached a deal with Albania to place more UK Border Force Staff in its capital Tirana. To a lesser extent, the Irish Government is also attempting to tackle migration. It has been reported that gardai are checking the documents of those seeking asylum before they get off the plane. It was also reported that more than 5,000 asylum seekers entered Ireland with false documents or none at all last year. A key task for the Government will be balancing tighter controls on migration without stoking the fire under far-right agitators. The number of protests taking place outside places providing accommodation for asylum seekers continues to grow week by week. The Taoiseach warned TDs their language could inadvertently play into the hands of these protesters. The Government will have to make sure its language and actions on migration do not do the same. news@irishmirror.ie Graphic   ran out of capacity The Citywest hubsummit Ursula von der Leyenintegration Minister O'Gormantalks Taoiseach Leo Varadkar","Tabloid",0,"2023-02",0,"Migration"

The data focused on the influx of refugees to Ireland since the turn of the century and created a machine-learning model capable of predicting future numbers.

'And if you eat, I will eat.' Hercules was born in south Ukraine but has lived in the UK since she came here, aged 18, to study Italian and international relations. She became a chef - partly because cooking helped keep her connected to her home and family - and eventually a food writer and teacher. In her books, particularly Mamushka and Summer Kitchens, she encourages us to appreciate Ukraine through food and stories. Her Instagram has always pulsed with colour - the pink-green stripy Ukrainian tomatoes she picks with her mother in the summer, jars of preserved beets, meals eaten beneath canopies of greenery. She posts short videos of her cooking too, always wearing one of her trademark Ukrainian scarves round her head. When Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Hercules became more than a food writer, she became an activist, a warrior. That day she posted old black-and-white photographs of her maternal grandmother, who had been put on a cattle train in the 1930s and transported to Siberia, and her paternal grandmother, whose father - a cobbler - had been shot by Bolsheviks. They then took his cow and his house and left his family with nothing. 'You may be rattling your sabre,' Hercules wrote, in the accompanying post, 'but we have a million cloaked ghosts behind us, sharpening their scythes, waiting for you. These are my ghosts. They may be dead, but their spirit is within me? If they managed to overcome these horrors, trust me, we will resist your psychopathic tsarist ambitions.' My spine tingled. I marvelled at this strength and started to check her posts several times a day. It felt as if she was on the frontline, even though she was in east London. Hercules, 38, is stunningly beautiful, and usually has the most perfect red lips. Today she looks exhausted, and cries intermittently. 'We really didn't expect Putin to invade,' she says, 'it was a huge shock.' She stops to take a breath and holds her head in her hands. 'Despite what happened in Crimea, we didn't see it coming. I mean, what is the justification for invading a country where people are just going about their daily lives?' The sheer shock floored her. Her parents were in Ukraine - her home town is Kakhovka, 80 miles from Crimea - together with her brother and endless aunts, uncles and cousins. my parents every day I didn't know how to live, how to exist with this horror. I could hear gunfire in the background when we talked. Sometimes I just shouted and cried. I told my husband I didn't want to go on. At other times I felt the strongest I have ever felt in my life.' She believes Ukrainians live with the trauma of their past: 'Ukraine has always been attacked. It's a corridor between Asia and Europe, it's vulnerable. My whole life I've suffered from some kind of anxiety or other. It's as if Ukrainians are born with this and hold on to it as a way of preparing themselves to cope. I get very anxious about small things, but I seem to have reserves for the big things. Do you know the word znyschyty? It means to crush a country. That's what some Russians have been trying to do for years, to obliterate our culture and our language. We lived through Stalin, and we will get through this. In a sense I was ready. I've been preparing for this all my life.' She plugged into these reserves, pushed aside the shock and replaced it with defiant energy. Her brother, Sasha, joined the civilian army to fight in Kyiv but had, like most Ukrainian men, no equipment except a rifle, and no training. 'One week people were on their laptops drinking lattes. Sasha was working on his start-up. The next my cousins were making Molotov cocktails. My brother thought he could fight in jeans and track shoes. They needed vests, boots, helmets and radios,' says Hercules. 'I didn't even stop to think about it, there was work to be done and that was that.' Hercules didn't set up a charity to raise money, she put the details of a PayPal account on her Instagram posts. 'People said that I had to do things properly but there was no time for that. I needed to get money in.' In just two days she had amassed £100,000 and the money was still coming. Wars are usually delivered through headlines and cold specifics - which towns are being bombed, the that there were real people suffering in Ukraine, and she brought us their stories every day. The public had trust in her to do the right thing with their money. 'I was overwhelmed by the response here,' she says. 'I'm in awe of the British people.' Before long she had volunteers working round her kitchen table, answering phone calls and emails, helping the public understand how to donate. 'People just came. They held me up, they worked with me,' she says. A woman she didn't even know brought her broth to help keep her strength up. 'As soon as I tasted it, I was able to eat. I ate only that broth for weeks.' Her life became a whirlwind of media interviews. She was photographed in her Ukrainian blouses - she had always worn these, it wasn't just for this new role - with her hands on her hips, looking like the mamushkas, the mothers and grandmothers, the strong Ukrainian women she so admires. The number following her Instagram account rocketed. She harnessed social media's power to disseminate news, to raise money, to let people see what the real Ukraine was like, not a country of fascists as Putin would have you believe. She posted powerful videos speaking You could see how tired and traumatised she was. 'I didn't think about trolls or becoming well known,' she says. 'Social media was a way to communicate with people, so I did it.' The most powerful thing Hercules posted during this time was a video of her brother in falling snow. He was speaking in Ukrainian so I couldn't understand a word, and yet I could understand all of it. Sasha was smiling broadly, excitedly showing us his fellow combatants with their new equipment. This is what Hercules had achieved. I watched it through tears. With her friends, Russian food writer Alissa Timoshkina and social-media influencer Clerkenwell Boy, Hercules established Cook for Ukraine. The idea was to hold suppers, organise cake sales, do any food-focused activity you could to raise money for charities working in Ukraine, including Unicef. It has raised more than £1 million. Hercules got Covid, but within days she was posting pictures that showed Ukraine during an idyllic summer. Images of wars are unremittingly bleak, but she posted a Ukraine of sunflower fields, ripe watermelons and meadows. You could feel the warm lazy air and understand why Ukrainians are fighting so hard to hold on to their country. parents - journalists and activists - started being kidnapped she was terrified and pleaded with them to leave: 'They were very stubborn. They didn't see why they should go when they'd done nothing wrong. Mum has a B&B and my father has a company that makes agricultural equipment. They felt responsible for their employees. Then I learnt that they had received threats and kept this information from me. I had a hysterical attack, an anxiety attack I suppose you'd call it, on the phone to them. I told them I wouldn't be able to go on if they died. I asked what would then happen to my children, to my family here. They gave in.' Her parents' exodus was slow. They had to negotiate 19 checkpoints. 'My mum said she wasn't scared but that she had never experienced such humiliation. She explained there were three types of Russian soldier, the ones who looked as if they were from the most deprived backgrounds, those who were so young they weren't even shaving and, the worst, the very confident, older types who would goad you.' At the last checkpoint one of these older men asked for her name, then asked again, slowly studying her passport, then said, 'Why are you leaving?' Her father drove for five days to get to Germany, where a family member had a small holiday home. Hercules flew there, arriving before they did, to cook for them. She made borscht, the Ukrainian national dish. 'They had such pride,' she says. 'My mum told me that the house looked lovely and that, when the Russians came, they would find a well-kept home. She took only family photographs and small pieces of her embroidery - she hid the larger pieces. It was heartbreaking.' With her parents safe she could get a little peace. Her husband, Joe Woodhouse, a food photographer and writer, had been holding everything together - their two children, family meals and Hercules herself. I got in touch with him during what looked like the worst period to see how she was. 'There are swings from low to lower,' he said. 'We are learning to cope with this new norm every day.' Hercules started posting pictures of outings with the children, looking happy, and of herself from the past - in Paris, in Italy - as if she was trying to hold on to who she had been before the invasion. With every post she talked about Ukraine. She needed to 'keep Ukraine front of mind'. She managed to get her 13-year-old niece, who is now living with them, out of Ukraine. Hercules is still delivering 'human news bulletins' every day, along with updates on the visa situation and advice on what food to buy if you're welcoming Ukrainian refugees into your home. She gets a video from Sasha every morning. 'It always arrives at the same time,' she says. '7am.' How, I ask, will this end? 'I have read everything and watched everything I can about Putin,' she says, 'I don't know whether he acts like this because he grew up in poverty, or whether it's because a rat he'd cornered attacked him when he was a boy, and I really don't care.' I believe he loves Ukraine, I say, and that he had his honeymoon there. 'F?k him,' she says, swiping the air. 'And Henry Kissinger with his idea of giving territory to Russia to end the war, f?k him too.' She believes that, with arms from the West, Ukraine will hold Russia back. 'But what I really want to see is Russians taking to the streets to protest.' 'I suppose they're scared,' I say. She bristles. 'We're scared! Ukrainians are scared! But if enough Russians protest, en masse, it will work. They can't throw everyone in prison.' She believes the war will be over by the autumn. What about the pundits who predict it will go on for at least a decade? She slumps. 'I can't contemplate that. Next summer I want to be in Ukraine. We have a huge family gathering, we call it ""the summit"", where we all get together to talk and eat and drink outside underneath my mum's vines. We're going to be there.' Her latest book was finished in 2021, when this crisis hadn't been foreseen, but it's uncannily apt. It's called Home Food: Recipes To Comfort and Connect. Hercules was taught, by her mother and aunts, that cooking can be an act of defiance and self-preservation. There are sublime Ukrainian dishes in this book, but recipes from the rest of her life too. 'It's about comfort,' she writes in the introduction, 'And about the connections we all make in life through our experiences of meals shared with those we love. That is what food, and choosing cooking as my livelihood, is all about for me.' She dreams of opening a cookery school in Ukraine, near her home town: 'When the war is over, I want to teach young Ukrainians to cook. Cooking and baking are restorative and we'll need that.' For now, she's very much in the middle of this crisis. The house is unsettled. It has the sluggish pulse of burned-up adrenalin. She still doesn't quite know how to live with what's happening. How could she? But she keeps being pragmatic and has a lot of support. 'There are going to be sunflowers here,' she smiles as she opens the door to her garden. A friend planted them so she could have a bit of Ukraine in London. 'This has changed me. I can't imagine not being an activist now,' she says. 'I mean I used to pay attention to politics, and I voted, but that was it. Now I see what can be achieved.' She knows that there will be a lot to do when the war ends. 'Not just to fix the country and its infrastructure, but its people. A lot of them will be traumatised. We will need to start putting them back together.' Her work, it seems, has only just begun.

The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said refugees would still make an application under the UK's Homes for Ukraine scheme but could choose the Scottish Government as their sponsor. The move came after Nicola Sturgeon said her government could act as a ""super sponsor"" for 3,000 refugees to speed up the number being admitted. The First Minister yesterday welcomed the announcement, saying that refugees would be given temporary accommodation while a more permanent place is found for them. She said multi-agency teams are working to ensure accommodation, safeguarding and support ""as well as the warmest of welcomes"" is provided. The announcement came after official figures suggested that the public response to the Homes for Ukraine scheme had been stronger proportionally in the other three home nations. As of 10am on Wednesday, 8,625 applications had been made in Scotland out of a UKwide total of 147,513. The total in England was 122,390, Wales 10,236 and Northern Ireland 6,262. Welcoming the extension of the scheme, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Our distinct offer for a warm Scottish welcome to the displaced people of Ukraine is now open, as part of the UK's Homes for Ukraine. We intend to fully harness the thousands of individual offers from people in Scotland willing to provide Ukrainians with a home. And I encourage those who want to help to express an interest on the Homes for Ukraine portal.

The Scottish Government's Super Sponsor scheme, which was launched in March, has descended into chaos as almost 30,000 visas have been issued to people fleeing the Russian invasion, but there is not enough safe housing for them to live in. Officials have so far refused to release figures on how many Scots have offered to share their homes with a Ukrainian, but data show that a far lower proportion have directly sponsored an individual to come to the UK than is the case south of the border. It was originally planned that those arriving through the Super Sponsor route would be put up in hotels or university halls temporarily, before being placed with a host family. The scheme meant the SNP Government, rather than an individual host, spon sored a Ukrainian's visa. However, some people who applied to take in a refugee several weeks ago are still waiting to be vetted by Scottish councils to ensure that a property is suitable. Others who have been vetted are still waiting to hear whether they have been accepted, MSPs have said. The Daily Telegraph revealed yesterday that the crisis has become so severe that SNP ministers are also considering issuing a formal plea to the British Army to help provide accommodation. ""The Scottish Government's handling of the refugee scheme has been an unmitigated disaster,"" Alex Cole-Hamilton, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said. ""The scale of this humanitarian challenge has been clear for months but Scottish Government pledges have frequently outrun the practicalities. ""We need a fresh push on securing volunteer hosts and more money for vetting them as soon as possible. Unless this is resolved swiftly there will be real questions over whether the ministers in charge should remain in place or whether fresh leadership is required."" A huge cruise ship has been hired in Edinburgh to house Ukrainians and the Scottish Government is believed to be searching for a second vessel, which would be situated on the Clyde. According to the latest figures, only around 10,000 Ukrainians have arrived under the Super Sponsor route, but almost 20,000 more have been granted permission to come to Scotland under the scheme, before it was axed last month. Several hundred per week are believed to be arriving. Miles Briggs, the Scottish Tory MSP, said he had been contacted by several of his constituents in Edinburgh who had offered to share their homes but had not yet been approved because of problems with vetting. As soon as parliament comes back we need a statement from the minister or the First Minister on this,"" he said. ""They have been aware of these issues for some time but have failed to put in place the help and support needed. ""The First Minister needs to get a grip of this situation urgently as people are being left in limbo. I have heard from willing hosts still waiting to be vetted, while others have been visited but then not heard any thing else. It is a dysfunctional scheme."" The Scottish Government has insisted its cruise ship in Leith has been popular with refugees, despite it having windowless rooms which at capacity would be more cramped than prison cells. Ms Sturgeon has previously said she would personally house a Ukrainian refugee ""if needed"", but later rowed back on the pledge.

The Daily Telegraph understands that Scottish Government officials have discussed the unusual step of making a military aid to civil authorities (MACA) request to the Ministry of Defence, due to fears thousands of refugees will arrive in Scotland with nowhere to go. Meanwhile, the Scottish Government is also believed to be exploring hiring a second cruise ship, based on the Clyde, despite controversy over housing Ukrainians in windowless rooms on a vessel in Edinburgh. Discussions about the MACA are believed to have taken place between Scottish and UK Government staff. Almost 30,000 visas have been issued under the ""super sponsor"" initiative, but despite fewer than 9,000 arriving in Scotland as of last week, there is a lack of housing for them. The scheme was axed last month and the Scottish Government is ""exploring all options"" to solve the crisis. Monica Lennon, the Scottish Labour MSP, said: ""These developments show just how badly the Scottish Govern ment has handled the 'super sponsor' scheme. Ukrainian families deserve the best possible accommodation and support, rather than the half-baked measures the SNP is currently offering. ""SNP ministers must get a grip of this crisis and ensure people seeking sanctuary are treated with dignity."" MoD officials are believed to be braced for a formal request from the Scottish Government, but there is confusion within the UK Government about what meaningful help the Army could give as it does not have a large amount of spare accommodation in Scottish barracks. The Scottish Government has previously warned that councils could be forced to place refugees in ""camp beds in community settings"" due to a lack of suitable accommodation. Ms Sturgeon suggested UK Government ministers lacked humanity by failing to do enough to provide visas to Ukrainian refugees and successfully pushed for her administration to be allowed to directly ""sponsor"" applications to come to the UK. It meant individuals would be granted a visa more quickly as they would not have to wait to be matched with an individual willing to share their homes, with responsibility falling on the Scottish Government to find them temporary accommodation until a more permanent solution was found. SNP ministers have provided £5million to refurbish disused high-rises in Lanarkshire, which had been due to be demolished, in a bid to bring 200 flats back into use. Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, said: ""The collapse of the 'super sponsor' scheme is a gross betrayal by the SNP and we need to get it up and running again - but not by cutting more corners on accommodation. The SNP's decision to house refugees on a cruise ship was a disgrace, and it beggars belief that they are doubling down on this shameful plan. It would be grossly inappropriate to force people fleeing war to live in Army barracks, and the SNP must rule this out."" Miles Briggs, the Scottish Tory MSP, said: ""The SNP Government's so-called super sponsor scheme is a classic example of them overpromising and underdelivering. [The MACA would be] further proof that the SNP's pursuit of positive headlines comes before the welfare of Ukrainian refugees."" A spokesman for the Scottish Gov ernment said that it was ""exploring all options to provide safe and secure accommodation as part of its warm Scottish welcome to displaced Ukrainians. However, no formal request has been made to the MoD to help"". The cruise ship in Edinburgh had ""received a very positive reception from the people on board"", he added. The MoD said it had not received a formal request but ""under the MACA process, Defence always stands ready to respond to requests from civil authorities in line with established principles"".

It has also emerged that a complaint was made to the Scottish Government by a member of the public who raised concern over claims about the number of Ukrainians being accommodated. Scottish Government officials ruled that the ministerial code of conduct had not been breached but told the complainant that ""the relevant policy officials have been informed about the details of your correspondence and will revise future statements to more clearly reflect the nuanced position and avoid any ambiguity"". The First Minister stated in March that more than 23,000 displaced people from Ukraine had arrived in Scotland since the UK Government opened a fast-track visa corridor in March 2022. Nicola Sturgeon, his predecessor, made a similar claim in February, stating that Scotland had so far welcomed ""more than 23,000 Ukrainians into our communities"". This is supported by UK Government figures showing 26,039 refugees with a Scottish sponsor have so far arrived from Ukraine. Of these, 20,594 have been sponsored by the Scottish Government and 5,445 have been sponsored by private individuals. But the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities publishes separate data on support funding for Scottish councils under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.

Nearly £2m is to be spent on 31 hubs across 27 local authorities, the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities said. Hubs are already up and running at airports including at Luton, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, and at St Pancras International train station in London. The centres will provide food, clothing and sanitary products to arrivals, act as a space for matched families to meet one another and help Ukrainians travel onward to their accommodation. Emergency £200 cash grants will also be available for those who need them. The move comes as refugee campaigners voice despair at slow progress, red tape and disparity between the UK and EU's approach to the crisis. Official figures show that as of Wednesday, more than two weeks after the launch of the government's much-vaunted Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, only 2,700 visas had been granted under it.  The UK has granted 25,500 visas to Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of March, 22,800 of which have been issued to people hoping to join relatives in the UK under the Ukraine Family scheme. More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia invaded in February, the vast majority settling in Poland, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. About 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. Leading charities have called on the government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees as a short-term measure to bring the UK in line with the EU. The Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam said the visa system was ""causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians"".

She applied on 17 February under a priority scheme meant to fast track skilled workers under the UK's post-Brexit points-based immigration system. However, she is still waiting for a decision. Said, 38, and her 74-year-old mother fled to neighbouring Moldova six weeks ago after their region of Odesa was one of the first places bombed by the Russians. She said: ""I feel profoundly let down by the whole system. It just feels like it is stuck in limbo somewhere and there's no way to know what is the truth any more."" Said, who has a PhD in clinical pharmacology, manages a clinical trial on the treatment of eating disorders at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, where she has worked since August 2021. Dr Hubertus Himmerich, a clinical senior lecturer who works with Said at KCL, said the trial she was running ""might lead to a scientific and medical breakthrough"" in the pharmacological treatment of anorexia nervosa. He added: ""It is heartbreaking that a highly qualified medical researcher like Lena is currently not allowed to enter the UK and is prevented from continuing research that might save young lives. Said came to the UK in September 2020 on a student visa to complete a master's at University College London. She had to return temporarily to Ukraine in January when her student visa expired. She then applied for a skilled worker visa, sponsored by King's College, to move to the UK permanently. Now stuck in the Moldovan capital, Chi?inau, Said said she was ""trying to survive day to day"". She and her British partner, Richard Beenham, have tried to find out the status of her visa but have been given conflicting responses from junior UK visas and immigration officials. She said: ""It's a massive disgrace. I'm checking my emails probably thousands of times a day just in the hope that I can go back to the place where I have what resembles a normal life and not stuck in a country where there is nothing for me, no work, no family. It feels incredibly isolating and devastating that [there is a] lack of caring from people who have the power to direct how someone's life goes."" Official figures show that, as of last Thursday, the UK has issued visas to 45% of the 65,000 Ukrainians who have applied under two schemes. However, under the much-vaunted Homes for Ukraine scheme, which matches strangers in the UK with people in Ukraine, only 4,700 visas have been issued of the 32,200 applications. Leading charities have called on the government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees as a short-term measure to bring the UK in line with the EU. More than 4.2 million Ukrainians have fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion, according to the UN's refugee agency. About 6.5 million people are displaced internally within Ukraine. Kate Larmer, who co-founded Farnham Homes for Ukraine to match those fleeing war with homes in Surrey, said the UK's ""heinous"" visa requirements were adding to people's emotional distress. Her group has submitted 136 visa applications on behalf of Ukrainians, including dozens of children, but only six have been issued, she said. Most of the 136 have been waiting for more than two weeks, and a ""significant proportion"" for more than three weeks. A government spokesperson said it was ""moving as quickly as possible"" to get Ukrainians to the UK. He added: ""We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK, simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers, while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. ""We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes, with almost 30,000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-04",0,"Migration"

But has the prime minister already lost faith in the home secretary? One cabinet source said Boris Johnson had been perturbed by the volume of negative headlines around the low number of refugees being granted visas, and speculated that Patel's future would again come under discussion at the summer reshuffle. They highlighted the cover of this week's Spectator magazine - formerly edited by Johnson - which featured a cartoon comparing the UK's bureaucratic response with that of other EU nations.  The scandal of the UK's inadequate offer to Ukrainian refugees makes the cover of the new Spectator, out tomorrow. Kate Andrews and Max Jeffrey report from Calais pic.twitter.com/lVseLPaHbZ - Fraser Nelson (@FraserNelson) March 9, 2022 Another MP said: ""Priti is fundamentally opposed to a more liberal system, yes, but the other issue is that she just cannot do effective, fast-paced delivery."" Allies of the home secretary say that criticism is deeply unfair; that officials are working 15-hour days to set up new systems from scratch and respond to changing humanitarian and security situations. They predict a significant rise in visa numbers by the end of the week, to about 5,000. The change Patel announced in response to an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday - to remove the need for Ukrainians with passports to make visa appointments - was hastily drafted in the previous 24 hours when officials realised the scale of the bottleneck in visa centres that are normally equipped to deal only with a handful of student or work permits. It has been a week of punishing criticism for the home secretary from her own MPs in parliament, including claims that had to be retracted about staffing in Calais and appointment wait times. Distraught families were banging on the windows of the Rzeszów visa centre when staff told them they were only able to see up to 100 applications in a day. The Tory MP Roger Gale said that Patel's behaviour this week would ""have been a resigning matter under any normal administration"". Another, Alec Shelbrooke, told the immigration minister Kevin Foster that the operation of the scheme was ""a disgrace"". On Tuesday, sources said Patel was given an uncomfortable grilling by cabinet ministers about the UK's response at their weekly meeting. One cabinet source said it was ""not a slanging match but more like an interrogation"". Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, cross-examined Patel repeatedly on the details of what was on offer and how support could be accessed. ""She floundered a bit,"" the source said. Others who have expressed frustration at the management of the scheme are the foreign secretary, Liz Truss; the defence secretary, Ben Wallace; and the health secretary, Sajid Javid. On Wednesday, Javid's department organised a separate plane to bring about 20 critically ill children to the UK for treatment. Several cabinet ministers have let their frustrations out during broadcast interviews when they have been repeatedly questioned about the failures. Shapps told broadcasters that ""lessons will be learned"" about how the response can be co-ordinated. A Patel ally did not deny there were tensions with the prime minister but said they did not think the home secretary had lost his confidence. ""The PM just wakes up and looks at the headlines and then moans about it,"" they said. ""Generally they have a pretty good relationship compared to almost anyone. ""She'll come speak to him, they see eye-to-eye on a lot. She likes him and she's taken a lot of blows for him. But of course it's difficult when there are just volumes of these tragic stories every single day in every paper."" Backbenchers describe feeling as if they have been slamming into a brick wall. Patel was urged internally to hold a video conference to explain the visa system to MPs but decided instead to send a ""dear colleague"" letter. There were also plans for her to make her own statement in the chamber, but events have forced announcements to be made at multiple urgent questions in the Commons. There is a broad view among MPs and officials that a wider Home Office culture - beyond Patel - is also at fault. One Whitehall source said Home Office officials genuinely believed its main problem was communication. ""If you've got people banging on the doors of the office in Poland, that's more than a comms problem."" Constant redrafting of the visa conditions has led to officials needing to hold thrice-daily briefings - more than any other situation has merited since Patel took over. One Whitehall source said there were genuine security concerns, citing the discovery of fake Ukrainian passports for sale. ""Over there are these Chechens groups, the Wagner Group mercenaries - her critics just aren't seeing the stuff she's seeing,"" the source said. Others named a combination of difficult delivery, inflexibility and ideology for the endless negative headlines. ""Fundamentally, cutting immigration dominates people's thinking,"" a former official said. ""They see their job, from when they wake up in the morning, as stopping people getting into this country. But actually, that's not their job.  ""Their job is to enforce our immigration policy - which does include letting some people in. Senior people are in that building now, reading these horrendous stories in the press and they are like: 'Argh, fuck, why is this happening again?' But if the general culture is to find ways of keeping people out, it's not a surprise really.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Olha, 36, who asked for her real name not to be used, moved in with her host who had registered with the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. But she was told to leave when she said she was unable to pay the money her host demanded. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities source said it was not acceptable for hosts to demand money from Ukrainian guests. Hosts can claim £350 a month from a government fund to cover the costs of hosting Ukrainian refugees. The deputy leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Hannah Clare, confirmed the council was aware of the case and condemned the government hosting scheme. ""The government's Homes for Ukraine scheme has been badly put together. Among its flaws is the fact that there is no mechanism for councils to transfer a Ukrainian guest to an alternative sponsor when something like this happens,"" she said. Olha, who was working in finance and economics before the war started, matched with a British woman in her 60s via a Facebook group and had registered with the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled her home in Dnipro on 28 March and began a dangerous and harrowing journey out of Ukraine by car. She arrived in Brighton about two weeks later. At first Olha thought things would go well with her host. She provided her with an evening meal when she arrived, but told her she would be expected to provide her own food after that.  But soon the host started demanding money and said Olha was costing her a lot in utility bills. ""She contacted the utility companies, asked them how much she had spent that week and told me that since I had arrived her energy bills had gone up a lot and that I needed to pay her £50 per week for energy bills. She said if I didn't want to pay her I had to leave,"" said Olha. ""I felt so upset I thought it would have been better for me to stay at home in Ukraine so that I wouldn't experience anything like this."" She left her host's home and has managed to find someone from a local church who offered to let her stay with her for a few days. ""I'm in a very difficult situation because my family are still in Ukraine. My brother is a soldier and my mother has refused to leave the country. I've received contradictory information about what I should do next. I don't want to scare other Ukrainians who are coming here but what happened to me is dreadful. It has caused me so much stress and made me feel totally unsafe. My host told me I needed to go. But where should I go? I have only just arrived in the UK."" According to the latest government data 6,600 people have arrived as part of the Ukraine sponsorship scheme with 39,300 visas for the initiative granted. Another 15,000 people have arrived under the Ukraine family scheme with 32,500 of these visas granted. Advice on the government website said sponsors should inform their local council if a hosting arrangement breaks down. Clare said: ""We are sadly aware of this really unfortunate situation. We understand that the woman in question is safe and has been helped by a local community group to find another place to live temporarily. We will do what we can to offer her support. ""Homes for Ukraine is a private matching scheme that is not mediated by councils. We have warned all along of the risk of some relationships breaking down and inappropriate hosts taking part due to a lack of proper oversight by the government. ""The scheme is at its heart deeply flawed. Councils have no control over when Ukrainian guests arrive in the city, nor do we get adequate notice. We rely on information from hosts about when refugees are arriving. With this in mind it isn't possible for councils to carry out property and welfare checks before guests arrive.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-04",0,"Conditions"

Speaking at the end of an EU summit in Versailles, the French president was eviscerating about Johnson's approach towards those fleeing Russia's bombs. He said that by insisting that visa applications to the UK must be made in person in Brussels and Paris, the British government had imposed additional misery on desperate men, women and children. Macron accused the British government of failing to live up to its ""grand statements"". ""I would hope that the Ukrainian men and women who have lived through horror and crossed Europe to reach their families on UK territory will be better treated,"" he said. The searing criticism of the British prime minister came as Russian airstrikes hit three more cities in Ukraine on Friday and tanks and artillery moved to what appeared to be firing positions to the north-west of the capital, Kyiv. Across the country, Ukrainian civilians are being shelled as they seek to flee besieged cities, in what is now the fasting-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. In a Versailles declaration on Friday the EU said it would ""offer temporary protection to all war refugees from Ukraine"", with the UK almost alone in Europe in insisting that even those with relatives in Britain must apply for visas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, had claimed until Thursday that stringent in-person security checks at application centres were also needed to stop Russian agents or terrorists smuggling themselves into the UK. Under heavy pressure from MPs across the Commons, Patel reversed her policy on Thursday, announcing that online applications could be made from next Tuesday. But Macron said more had to be done by the British government, with already more than 2 million people having fled Ukraine and millions more expected. He said: ""I welcome the British shift, which shows there was a problem, despite what was being said at the time. I think nobody would have understood that despite all the grand statements we share that the British government continued to apply current rules that meant they did not welcome Ukrainian refugees who wanted to reach British soil saying they have to travel hundreds of kilometres in order to apply for a visa. ""It's a glimmer of pragmatism that they're starting to align themselves with their own statements, which is a step in the right direction, although much remains to be done. I think the French home affairs minister's letter was a helpful one [ Gérald Darmanin wrote to Patel at the weekend urging her to set up UK consular services in Calais]. ""Obviously we will do what we can and we are trying to cut back on the red tape so they can reach more dignified living conditions. I would like to thank the UK government for for this first step and we will over the coming day see whether it is enough or whether more effective measures are required."" The UK has so far only granted 957 visas out of at least 22,000 applications in progress. The policy of in-person applications caused chaos in Calais earlier this week as Patel had falsely claimed that a visa centre had been opened. Refugees who had travelled 1,400 miles (2,250km) to the Channel were welcomed by UK government posters informing them they needed to go to Paris or Brussels to make their applications. A minister later clarified that the application centre in Calais was in the process of being established, prompting calls for Patel's resignation by the Tory MP Roger Gale for misleading the House of Commons. The UK's Ukraine family scheme allows Ukrainian family members of British nationals and those settled in the UK to stay in Britain on successful completion of a visa application. Refugees who can find a private sponsor or local authority willing to provide housing and integration support can also come for an initial period of 12 months. In contrast, under the EU's policy all Ukrainian refugees have the right to live and work in the bloc for at least a year and potentially up to three years. Ukrainian citizens already have 90-day visa free access to the EU. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters in Versailles: ""Indeed we welcome this improvement for the Ukrainian refugees, this is a good step in the absolute right direction. ""As you know we in the European Union already a week ago activated the temporary protection directive for the very first time in the history of the EU, which gives all Ukrainians immediate residency rights, access to the labour market, to schools, to medical care, to other support, so that these poor people can find a home and be accommodated in the European Union.""

Despite promises by the Association of British Insurers that people would not be penalised for taking in those fleeing the Ukrainian war, John Lewis demanded an extra £41.74 from Cath Bateman, on top of the £381 it recently charged to renew her home insurance. Bateman, who lives in a terrace house in Dartford, decided to offer the Ukrainian family somewhere to stay after learning that they were crammed into a small house. The family - a mother, her daughter aged 12 and four-year-old son - had been rescued from Poland by the mother's sister, who is originally from Ukraine but now lives in the UK. After the Guardian raised her case with the company, John Lewis said a mistake had been made, and that Bateman would be refunded. ""I don't have a big house but had two free rooms and offered to put them up when I learned that they were having to sleep on the floor,"" said the retired teacher. ""I thought I had better tell my insurer - more out of courtesy than anything - but couldn't believe it when they called me back to say that I would have to pay an extra £41. It feels completely wrong."" At the start of the conflict the Association of British Insurers said the industry stood ""united with the people of Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion"" and that people housing refugees would not face financial penalty. ""If you are a homeowner in the UK and want to temporarily house refugees who have been displaced from the conflict in Ukraine as non-paying guests in your home, you do not need to inform your insurer and your cover will remain the same,"" it said. ""This applies for the first 12 months of any refugees living with you, including when your policy is due for renewal. After 12 months, if any refugees are still living with you, then you should tell your insurer when you next renew your policy."" A spokesperson for John Lewis said: ""We aren't charging any additional premiums for our customers who are welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their homes. We're very sorry a mistake was made in this case and the customer will receive a full refund."" This was just one issue faced by Bateman. She has been told that because the family were brought into the UK on a family visa by the sister, she will not be able to claim the £350 a month payments the government has offered. She has also been told that she has to get a £95 gas boiler safety certificate at her own expense. ""I'm still really pleased I have done it, and we are getting on well.

Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders. The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation was quickly deteriorating after Russia's invasion, estimating that several thousand had already fled with more expected to follow. It appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking a safe haven. ""We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety,"" said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. At the Luzhanka border crossing with Hungary in western Ukraine, hundreds of cars waited in a queue snaking more than 2 kilometres back from the border on Thursday afternoon. People said they had been waiting over six hours in line to cross. A steady stream of people crossed on foot, carrying suitcases and holdalls stuffed with belongings. Many were Ukrainians from the Hungarian minority that live in the west of the country, and said they were traveling to stay with relatives for a few days in the hope the danger would pass. Others had come from other parts of Ukraine and planned to drive on to Western Europe. ""The people who have money are leaving,"" said one of the customs officials at the post. He said over 1,500 people had left through the crossing by 4pm on Thursday, as opposed to just a few hundred on a normal day. One 19-year-old man from the town of Svyalava said he had left both because he was scared of Russian assault and of potentially being called up to the Ukrainian army. ""My brother lives in Hungary and I'll stay with him as long as it takes,"" he said, waiting at the border post. He asked not to use his name. Others also said they were fleeing before receiving army call-ups. People carrying luggage and accompanied by children crossed into the Polish city of Medyka, and lines of cars stretching for miles were reported on the approach to Ukraine's border with Moldova. For weeks, central European countries on Ukraine's western border have been making preparations for a potential influx of millions of refugees. Authorities in the countries next to Ukraine have already identified border crossings through which people can leave the country by land, such as Vyné Nemecké in Slovakia, Zhony in Hungary, Siret in Romania, and Palanca in Moldova. Maia Sandu, the president of Moldova, said on Thursday there was an increase in traffic flow on the border. Poland is preparing a train, with medical equipment, to transport wounded civilians from the Ukrainian border to Polish hospitals, said the country's health minister. ""We are preparing a sanitary train with full rescue service and medical equipment to transport the injured,"" said Adam Niedzielski. ""This solution was created completely from scratch and, so far, has not been used in Poland. At the same time, we already have a list of 120 hospitals throughout the country to which victims may go. In total, we estimate at the moment that it would be possible to admit several thousand patients."" Poland, in particular, has been preparing for various scenarios, including a wave of up to a million people fleeing Ukraine, said Maciej Wasik, the deputy interior minister. Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians , many of whom moved after the 2014 conflict, and they have taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. A few days ago, local authorities in the countries bordering Ukraine were asked to indicate the list of accommodation facilities for refugees, the number of people it would be possible to accommodate, the costs involved and the timeframe for the adaptation of buildings. The ground floor of the exhibition centre in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzeszów has been equipped to receive people who may flee Ukraine, about 30 miles to the east. Germany has said it will offer support to countries in eastern and central Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees. German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and a million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine in the event of a war. ""We will offer massive support to the affected states - especially our neighbour Poland - in the event of large refugee movements,"" the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said in a statement, adding she had been in touch with the Polish government and the European Commission. Franziska Giffey, the mayor of Berlin, told news outlet RBB 24 that the German capital was preparing for the arrival of refugees. ""For next week, we have set ourselves the goal of discussing concrete implications, what preparations we can make, especially in the event of people fleeing this situation,"" Giffey said. Other countries in Europe have offered support to countries in eastern Europe in case of a wave of refugees leaving Ukraine. António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, said potential refugees from Ukraine were welcome in the Iberian country, home to a large Ukrainian community. ""Ukrainian citizens who have family, friends and acquaintances here are welcome in Portugal,"" Costa said, promising to facilitate the issuance of entry visas.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-02",0,"Conditions"

False reports exaggerating how much aid refugees receive compared with local people, as well as linking refugees with violent crime and political extremism, could cause a breakdown in relations with local communities, the charity World Vision said. In its report, Warm Welcomes, Lurking Tensions , the humanitarian organisation said anti-refugee messaging was already spreading on social media and “niche media outlets” in neighbouring countries. About 8.8 million people, mainly women, children and elderly people, have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, with many making their way to border countries such as Romania, Moldova and Poland. “Messaging that could stoke anti-refugee tensions is already being spread in Romania, Moldova, Poland and across central and eastern Europe,” the report said. “Whilst not a major issue yet, tensions are beginning to develop in some host countries. “Children may face risks such as verbal and physical abuse between refugee and host communities, human trafficking and more as early as February 2023. “The international community needs to act now in order to prevent the situation deteriorating to dangerous levels like in Lebanon and Bangladesh.” The report’s lead author, Charles Lawley, an advocacy, policy and external engagement senior adviser at World Vision, said disinformation campaigns would change attitudes if misreporting was allowed to continue unchallenged. He said: “Whilst the disinformation campaigns have, thus far, been largely unsuccessful as solidarity with refugees from the host community remains strong, if it goes unchecked it will continue to worsen resentment towards refugees which we are seeing is starting to materialise. “In contexts like Lebanon, which has a considerable number of Syrian refugees , and Bangladesh, which has most of the world’s Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, disinformation went largely unchecked and became mainstream and has added to the extremely high tensions in those contexts.” The falsehoods being spread about Ukrainian refugees include exaggerating the financial support they are able to access, and incorrect claims of antisocial or illegal activity. There were also unfounded reports of local children being thrown out of hospitals and replaced by children from Ukraine, Lawley said. “Our case studies show a pattern which the Ukraine refugee influx is largely following,” he added, saying the initial response from the host community was “solidarity and hospitable”. But after a six- to 12-month period, the warm welcomes started to cool. “There are no obvious reasons why the contexts like Moldova and Romania, for example, would be exempt. When you consider how the global cost of living crisis is impacting everyone, we would argue that we expect tensions to develop soon if action is not taken.” Moldova in particular has felt the strain since the outbreak of war in neighbouring Ukraine. Europe’s poorest country has accommodated about 100,000 refugees, the most per capita in Europe. The numbers are equivalent to about 5% of the population, in a country where inflation is at 27% and the country’s almost total reliance on Russia and Belarus for gas has led to a fuel crisis. The report sets out a number of recommendations needed in order to ensure Ukrainian refugees do not suffer the same fate as others, such as Syrians who have been left displaced in Lebanon since civil war broke out in 2011. Local infrastructure should be improved for all communities, communication campaigns promoting coexistence and education about refugees, and opportunities for host communities and Ukrainian refugees, should be encouraged, the report said. “There are many valuable learnings governments and humanitarian responders alike in countries hosting large numbers of refugees from Ukraine can take from Lebanon, Chile, Bangladesh, Kenya and Uganda,” it said. “The distress of sudden displacement should not be compounded by facing negativity from the communities accommodating them. “If refugees in places like Poland, like refugees in Uganda, are immediately able to settle, take up employment, access public benefits such as healthcare and education, and can start their own businesses, then it has a significant impact on social cohesion.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks: ","Broadsheet",0,"2022-08",0,"Migration"

It was a telling assertion, not only because it is the sort of casually misleading claim we have grown used to from the home secretary, Priti Patel, and Boris Johnson, but also because it expresses a broader truth about the UK's treatment of refugees.  The statement was factually true - but only because Ukrainians do not need visas to enter the European Union, and the UK had to be strong-armed into broadening its restrictive definition of ""close relatives"". More than 2 million people have escaped the war, but the UK has accepted only 760 of 22,000 applications so far. A second scheme, yet to begin, will allow individuals and organisations to sponsor Ukrainians - again, cherrypicking victims of war rather than respecting the international convention setting out their rights. Ms Patel spoke of a new humanitarian route, only for Downing Street to swiftly rule that out. As with the asylum system overall, the approach is grudging, inefficient and overly bureaucratic, in large part because it is designed to keep people out. What meagre help is being offered has been dogged by confusion and contradiction. The home secretary promised she had ""surged a Home Office team"" to help at Calais, but families who had travelled over a thousand miles found a few officials giving out packets of crisps , and were told to go to Paris or Brussels to apply. Then a new ""pop-up"" centre in Lille, still 70 miles from Calais, was announced ; it now appears that it will neither take walk-in applications nor offer appointments but deal with biometrics for the ""most vulnerable"" of these traumatised people. One Ukrainian mother and daughter made eight trips to the UK visa processing centre in Paris , two trips to the British consulate there and one trip to the British embassy. Even after obtaining the correct visas, they were detained for a second time by UK Border Force officials in Calais. Plenty of refugees could testify to the incompetence and inhumanity of the UK's asylum system. The difference this time is that across Europe, including in places previously extremely hostile to migrants and refugees, there is greater public sympathy for white Europeans fleeing their homes. The meanness of the UK government's approach is not new; it is more visible this time, however, because it is not only out of step with domestic public opinion but strikingly at odds with the welcome now offered by other nations. Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a population of just 4 million, has taken more than 80,000 Ukrainians. The UK's failure to help Ukrainian refugees is not an accident, though its ineptitude has worsened the plight of many. It is possible to have a humane and efficient asylum system, but not when you promote stereotypes of refugees as a threat and a burden. The government has closed off safe routes - while its nationality and borders bill seeks to criminalise those who arrive here by irregular means.

In the past year more than 117,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under the hosting scheme. Another 49,000 have arrived to join relatives who were already living here. But practical problems face those who need to move on from the accommodation offered by UK sponsors and find themselves unable to rent or secure social housing. A survey of 325 Ukrainian refugees carried out by Generation Rent and the charity Opora, which supports Ukrainians in the UK, found that 49% had been unable to provide a guarantor when looking for somewhere to rent and 43% had been unable to find money for a tenancy deposit. British host families were asked to make an initial six-month commitment to accommodate refugees from Ukraine, and many have been unable to extend that invitation into a more permanent arrangement as the conflict has continued. A total of 4,630 Ukrainian refugee households have been classified as homeless after a relationship with their host family came to an end. The latest data shows a 44% increase in the number of Ukrainians presenting as homeless in the last month, according to the Local Government Association. A number of anniversary events this week have celebrated the achievements of the scheme, which was rolled out just 18 days after the start of the war and under which 71% of Ukrainian refugees in the UK are being hosted by people who were strangers beforehand, according to the Sanctuary Foundation, one of the main matching organisations helping hosts to find refugees. Krish Kandiah, the Sanctuary Foundation’s founder, describes the scheme as an overwhelming success, adding that it is “the largest UK response to a refugee crisis since the historic Kindertransport of 1939 ”. He hopes the programme will become a template for wider refugee sponsorship programmes, arguing that it has saved £4.4bn of taxpayers’ money because the government has not had to pay for hotel accommodation (unlike the Afghan resettlement programme, which saw those rescued from Kabul placed in hotels). But other organisations have called on the government to focus on the practical difficulties facing those who need to find independent housing. Stan Beneš, managing director of Opora, said: “This research makes it clear that Ukrainian refugees are currently facing a disproportionately high level of structural barriers in accessing the private rented sector. People are having to settle for properties that are clearly not suitable for sustainable rebuilding of lives, as reflected in the percentage reporting damp and mould, and unaddressed disrepair.” Anastasia Salnikova, who runs the J&C Soul group for Ukrainian refugees which supports families living in unsuitable temporary accommodation, said: “Often the council tells them they need to find and rent their own flats, knowing that they can’t do it. They feel abandoned.” She is supporting Anna Didenko, her husband, Dmytro, and their two children, Yaroslav, 10 and Bohdan, one, who have been sleeping on bunkbeds in a small room in a shared house shared in Hounslow since last July, when their original sponsor found himself unable to continue hosting them. They were told by the council the placement would just be for two or three weeks, but they have been there for almost eight months, sharing a kitchen with seven other households. “We’re happy to be here, away from the danger, but we feel neglected and ignored,” said Didenko, an accountant from Kyiv. Despite numerous visits to estate agents, their attempts to rent privately have been unsuccessful because they do not have the income or deposit required. There is no room for a table in the room, and their older son is struggling to do his homework on the top bunk. “It’s impossible to make any plans. Our situation feels humiliating and demoralising.” A government spokesperson said: “In the year since we launched Homes for Ukraine we have welcomed 117,100 people to safety thanks to the generosity of British families across the country. All guests can work and access benefits and local authorities have a legal duty to ensure no families are left without housing. “We are giving councils funding for each Homes for Ukraine guest and have recently also extended and increased ‘thank you’ payments for sponsors. Just yesterday we announced £1m to help Ukrainians improve their English and unlock employment opportunities.”","Broadsheet",0,"2023-03",0,"Migration"

These are not for her own granddaughter, but a three-year-old girl she has never met, who is arriving from Kharkiv in Ukraine. Three-year-old Daneliia, along with her parents Vlodymyr and Julia, is the second Ukrainian refugee family Jenni and her husband, Mark Chapple, are helping settle in Quirindi on the north-west slopes of New South Wales. They initially meet new arrivals online before they arrive in the country, ascertaining their needs - from what size clothing each person wears, to whether they take any medication. But the Chapples are thinking about the big picture too. They want to help Ukrainian refugees get work and make a life for themselves in northwestern NSW, where the cost of living is cheaper and workers are desperately needed across all industries. Their aim is to see 40 to 60 Ukrainian refugees living independently around Quirindi, the Liverpool Plains, Tamworth and Gunnedah by the year's end, arriving via Newcastle and the Hunter regions. The Chapples' proposal for a pathway to assist Ukrainians settle in regional NSW - the Chl project - is named after the first couple the Chapples sponsored, who are working with them on the initiative. Yuri and Inna Chuchenko say Mark and Jenni have done more than help them. ""They save us. They now like our mother and father,"" Yuri Chuchenko says. The couple were working in Thailand and expecting their first baby when Russia invaded Ukraine. Mark, who had worked in Ukraine in agricultural insurance, was sending offers of help to all his Ukrainian contacts, including friends of friends, like the Chuchenkos. While former prime minister Scott Morrison said it would be wrong to assume Ukrainians would not want to return home after the war , Yuri Chuchenko says ""in Ukraine, there is no way back."" Yuri, from the Donbas region occupied eight years ago, says, ""I can say that I lost everything twice. The first time I lost my home town in 2014. And now [my country] in 2022."" Inna, whose family is from Nikolaev in the country's south, says her grandmother had to shelter for three weeks in her apartment's bathroom without water or electricity. Yuri says, ""we want to stay in this country. We want to become citizens of this country, because unfortunately we don't have a home any more.""  'Crying out for workers'  The Australian government's temporary humanitarian visa is granted for a three-year period, during which the holder can work, study and access Medicare, and potentially participate in free English language tuition. Since 23 February, the Department of Home Affairs has granted more than 7,800 - mostly temporary - visas to Ukrainians in Ukraine and hundreds more to Ukrainians elsewhere. More than 3,000 have since arrived in Australia. About 40% have entered NSW, with just under 30% arriving in Victoria and 15% in Queensland. A spokesperson for the department said it is, ""progressing visa applications from Ukrainian nationals as a priority, particularly for those with a connection to Australia."" Mark says that while the majority of refugees are coming to the cities, the high cost of living in Sydney and Melbourne could make the experience stressful rather than successful, especially when government support ends. ""We know that the regional centres are crying out for workers. I've had three offers today,"" he says, referring to requests for Ukrainian workers. According to Jenni, the inability to get the labour needed in regional areas means employers are happy to support the Ukrainian refugees with a job and accommodation. A central part of the transition will be to connect refugees with host families until permanent accommodation is found. Jenni says five families have already volunteered, with offers to support refugees with temporary accommodation for a couple of weeks as well as more long-term arrangements.  Building communities  The interest from Ukrainian refugees has been strong. Since Mark posted about the project online at the beginning of May, the Chapples are receiving 12 inquiries a day. Jenni says the Ukrainians who have contacted them offer a wide range of skills, including those areas where professionals are most desperately needed.  ""We've got pharmacists that are looking for work. We've got doctors looking for work. Now how often do we hear of regional areas saying we need more doctors out here ? So there's there's been some promising conversations around those specialty jobs as well,"" she says. The project would also provide immediate support, including assistance with visa applications, clothing and health. However, Mark says, ""our basis for wanting to make this work is longevity."" In addition to helping the refugees find well-paid jobs that will allow them to become independent, the project aims to help them become part of regional communities and facilitate cultural exchange. According to Mark, one of the reasons refugees have gathered in cities is because that is where they can keep in touch with fellow Ukrainian expatriates. ""We don't want to send two families to Gunnedah, for example, we want to send 20 families so that they can also have their own culture ... so that they feel that they've got another family of Ukrainians two streets away,"" he says. The Chapples want Ukrainians to be able to teach regional communities about their culture at the same time as the project helps Ukrainians understand Australian - especially Indigenous - culture. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia's fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The project aims to provide community hubs for training and immediate support services, as well as working closely with local education facilities, and community groups to integrate Ukrainian refugees. Jenni says the Ukrainian people bring an incredible community-mindedness, strong work ethic as well as amazing food. Yuri, a past contestant on Ukrainian MasterChef, has not only been cooking delicious meals for the Chapples but will also participate in a cultural cooking festival, the Newcastle Unity in Diversity festival, held at the end of June.  'This is a paradise'  The Chapples have already contacted local governments for support and want to work with the state and federal governments. They have held meetings with the Liverpool Plains and Gunnedah shire councils to gain support for the project and discuss the opportunities for Ukrainian refugees in the regions that may be of mutual benefit. Councillor Donna Lawson at the Liverpool Plains Shire Council says, ""for the Liverpool Plains, we can benefit from a population injection of people who offer a wide variety of skills, many of whom have run successful companies before the war"". ""We offer a safe and friendly community that may also provide an easier and more relaxed transition to living in Australia than the city,"" she says. Jenni says the ups and downs of families adjusting to their new life are evident. ""They're hearing the news daily. When Kharkiv and Kyiv were being hard hit, you could see their faces, from about lunchtime onwards, their moods would change, they would be getting information through from home, families having to relocate to a safe space, all of those things,"" she says. Jenni stresses the project will support the mental health of refugees, to address any trauma arising from the war. Having communication lines for all medical support, but especially mental health support, is a crucial part of the Chapples' project. According to Mark, ""regional towns are very well renowned for helping others. There's no doubt in my mind, we can make it work."" ""It was said to Yurii on his first trip to Quirindi, 'why would you want to come and live in a town of 3,000 people?'."" ""And he said, 'well, why wouldn't I want to come? This is a paradise'.""

Though seeking asylum is free, the pastor of Calvary San Diego said his services are “not cheap.” In an interview with a Russian-language YouTube channel, he touted director computer access to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enroll migrants and was vague about “opportunists” in Mexico who ensure customers’ safety after they fly there on tourist visas and while they wait in Tijuana to cross. “I just know there’s a lot of power on that side that I just don’t control,” the evangelical Christian pastor said. “But I do have one control. I control who goes across. So I have to negotiate. To keep those people safe, I have to negotiate with those in power (in Mexico).” Asylum is supposed to be free and for those most in need; many have been unable to even ask for protection under COVID-19 restrictions that are set to expire Wednesday.  Yet Metzger’s service, as described in the 25-minute interview last month at his church in the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista, is a private money-generating enterprise that uses its government connections to bypass those restrictions. It’s part of an opaque, bewildering patchwork of exemptions CBP has developed. Immigration advocates select who gets in, though CBP has final say. Asked about an outside group charging money, the Department of Homeland Security said there is no fee related to exemptions from asylum restrictions and that it will “look into any allegation of abuse.” “DHS takes any allegations of fraud or abuse of our immigration systems very seriously,” it said in a written response to questions about the service. The pastor did not respond to text, email and phone messages left over a week and his office was closed when a reporter went there on a recent weekday afternoon. ___ This story is part of an ongoing Associated Press series, “Migration Inc,” which investigates individuals and companies that profit from the movement of people who flee violence and civil strife in their homelands. ___ Migrants have been denied rights to seek asylum more than 2.5 million times since March 2020 on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19 under Trump-era restrictions known as Title 42. Exemptions are supposed to be for migrants deemed most vulnerable in Mexico — perhaps for gender identity or sexual orientation, or for being specifically threatened with violence — but some partners say CBP doesn't question choices and that migrants selected often face no unusual danger. The agency doesn’t publicly identify its partners or how many slots are made available to each, leaving migrants guessing who they are and which ones are best connected to U.S. authorities. In El Paso, Texas, CBP gives out 70 slots daily, half for the government of Mexico's Chihuahua state and the rest for attorneys and advocacy groups, said Nicolas Palazzo, an attorney for Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, which participates in the arrangement. He said some attorneys unaffiliated with his organization charge migrants for the service. In Piedras Negras, Mexico, across from Eagle Pass, Texas, the city government chooses who escapes the reach of Title 42, according to a report last month from the University of Texas at Austin Strauss Center for International Security and Law. In Reynosa, across from McAllen, Texas, a migrant shelter picks who crosses, while in Laredo, Texas, there are no exemptions, the report says. In San Diego, CBP exempts about 200 people daily, including 40 slots that are set aside for Russian speakers working through Calvary San Diego, said Enrique Lucero, the city of Tijuana's director of migrant affairs, who regularly communicates with U.S. officials.  Other slots in San Diego are for advocacy groups Al Otro Lado, which operates an online registration list, and Border Angels, which leans on migrant shelter directors to select who gets to cross, and the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a refugee resettlement organization. CBP is allowing more Russians to enter the United States with Title 42 exemptions, with about 3 in 4 coming through California border crossings with Mexico. In October, it exempted 3,879 Russians, more than triple the same period a year earlier. It exempted 21,626 Russians in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, more than five times the previous year. In the YouTube interview last month with Alex Moore, Metzger said his call center fields more than 1,000 inquiries a day. CBP tells him how many people can cross and “I control who crosses.” “Honestly, we think it was God opening a door for us,” said Metzger, who grew up in Southern California but spent much of his adult life in Eastern Europe. Metzger is unclear on who he pays to greet customers in Mexico and bring them to the border, saying he doesn’t know them. Through a Telegram account called Most V USA, the cost for single adults paying cash was 1,800 (presumably U.S. dollars) Monday — a “price reduction.” For married couples paying cash, the cost was $3,500. Online payments were $300 less for individuals and $500 less for couples. Children were free. “You pay not for the crossing, but for the consultation on the crossing,” Most V USA says on its website. “We use the only legal way available to our organization — making an appointment with a CBP officer at the border.”  The price includes crossing to the United States safely in groups from Tijuana to San Diego, with a bag containing water and protein bars. Metzger opened his large church to Ukrainian refugees after Russia's invasion this year, working with volunteers on a smooth-running operation that deployed a mobile app used to track church attendance. Ukrainians who flew to Tijuana were told to report to a San Diego border crossing as their numbers approached, a system organizers likened to waiting for a restaurant table.  Metzger touts connections with CBP developed during that time and warns about falling for scammers who use his Most V USA brand.  “No, it’s not cheap. No, it’s not easy but we will make sure that it is safe and that you will get into the States,” he said.  ___ Associated Press writer Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-12",1,"Migration"

Ireland's accommodation system shunts vulnerable arrivals into Soviet-esque centres in remote areas, where they are served set meals in a canteen at fixed times and handed the princely sum of Euro 38.80 (£29) per adult and Euro 29.80 (£22) per child each week. That's a maximum ""allowance"" of just Euro 5.50 (£4) a day. The bulk of these glorified prisons were built in rural backwaters, with limited transport links and little to no support services. Each one has a chequered past; a convent in Waterford, a Midlands trailer park, abandoned Celtic-Tiger-era hotels. Residents who come from far-flung lands - from North Africa and the Middle East, to southeast Asia and the Balkans - live in communal settings, with single adults sharing rooms with up to eight others of different backgrounds and nationalities. Some centres house only men, some only women. Many have no shared language and many have lived through extreme trauma, having fled torture, trafficking, and tragic conflict. Before being granted such luxuries, those unlucky enough to find themselves at the mercy of this framework can spend up to six months in cramped city hotel rooms, where they must wait to receive a coveted temporary residence certificate, a lifeline without which asylum seekers cannot claim expenses or obtain a social security number. All they are left with is time. Arguably unique in its psychological cruelty, Direct Provision prevents people from living in the community, thereby stripping them of their independence and any ability to integrate into Irish society. Until 2018, Direct Provision residents had no right to work. Even now, they must wait six months and that right remains limited. There are currently 8,205 people - 2,658 of them children - in DP and emergency accommodation facilities across Ireland, according to the latest data. The average length of stay is 24 months, but some languish in the system for as long as 12 years. The malevolent undertones of Direct Provision are more pronounced by the fact that big business is making bank on the existence of such a system. The majority of centres are managed by private, for-profit contractors on behalf of the State. Aramark, a US catering conglomerate that runs some of Ireland's most iconic cafes and turned over a cool $14.6bn in 2017, is one of them. Years of criticism from international organisations and tireless activism from human rights groups including the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland has led to small-scale improvements, with asylum seekers now entitled to a driving licence, broader access to education, and a bank account in their own name. The Irish government last year caved to pressure and pledged to end Direct Provision by 2024, but fears are now mounting that myopia regarding the plight of Ukrainians could scupper that goal. Just as the Dail granted Ukrainians the right to live and work as EU citizens in Ireland, the body of an elderly woman, believed to be from Zimbabwe, was found in a Cork Direct Provision centre. She had been dead for several days before anyone noticed. Ireland expects to have welcomed 20,000 Ukrainian refugees into the state by the end of this month, which will be five weeks since Russia's invasion began. There they can work, study, and live just as any citizen of the Republic is entitled to live. While there is no question that my homeland is doing right by the people of Ukraine, such support should be extended to every man, woman and child fleeing war and persecution from every corner of the world. It should not be conditional on geography, geopolitics or how ""European"" they may appear to be.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Aid"

Using a pseudonym, Milena Ivakova, 61, said she fled her home in Odesa, a port city in southern Ukraine, while recovering from hip replacement surgery with her 40-year-old daughter and her three granddaughters aged 10, 17, 20 and 22. She is now working at the same refuge centre as a translator and language tutor, helping her fellow Ukrainian refugees learn Romanian so they can settle into their new home and find work. The centre, which is run by four Romanian non-governmental organisations, has received support and donations from humanitarian aid charity World Vision. World Vision is one of the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) member charities working directly or through local partners in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries to help the humanitarian crisis. Ms Ivakova and her family arrived in Iasi, a city in north eastern Romania and 200 miles north of the capital Bucharest , on March 9, having fled their native country the day before. They travelled by bus, car and walking before reaching their new home. The family left behind Ms Ivakova's son-in-law, who is a priest, and her two cats who he is looking after. Emotionally, I am so grateful to Romanians as they've helped us so much and still are helping all our people. They gave us food, they gave us clothes, they gave us everything Milena Ivakova After arriving at a friend's flat in the city, Ms Ivakova went to the refuge centre to seek supplies, including hygiene products and food, also have a doctor check her hip following the surgery. Speaking through a translator, Ms Ivakova told the PA news agency: ""(Fleeing Ukraine) was stressful. ""It was just after my surgery. ""I really needed to have doctor's assistance to check my wound and to have special medication. ""I had no choice (but to flee after the surgery). ""I walked three kilometres with crutches (nearly two miles) and then flagged down a car which drove me to the border while the rest of my family walked 10 kilometres (six miles). ""I couldn't walk any longer than that."" Ms Ivakova said while the family is grateful to the help and support they have received from Romanians, their ""hearts and souls"" remain in Ukraine. ""We talk with my son-in-law every day,"" she said. ""It's still very dangerous and unsafe where he is now. ""Physically, I feel a lot better since my surgery as time is passing and my wound has closed, and now I can walk with just one crutch. ""Emotionally, I am so grateful to Romanians as they've helped us so much and still are helping all our people. ""They gave us food, they gave us clothes, they gave us everything. ""We care very much about everything which is happening back at home. ""We think about it daily, we check the news, we're here but our souls and hearts are still in Ukraine. ""Not just my son in law but my friends, my colleagues, my whole life is back there. ""I had a conversation with one of my friends the other day while she was standing on a balcony at her home and I was talking to her, I saw the airport runway (in Odesa) being demolished from the bombing. ""She stopped the conversation and hid in a shelter."" She said she and her family will remain in Romania for the time being but want to return to Odesa when it is safe to do so. Since the end of March, Ms Ivakova, who is normally a language teacher in Ukraine, has been giving Romanian language lessons to her fellow refugees in the centre. Explaining why she decided to do so, she said: ""I believe that we do have to help each other. ""I still need help, I still receive help. ""We feel safe, we feel comfortable and I feel like we're cared for and protected in Romania. ""We feel like this place is our family. ""I don't feel like I come here as my work place, it feels like my home."" More than £300 million has been raised so far by DEC after it launched its Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal in March. Some of the money raised has gone towards World Vision, which is providing shelter kits, temporary sanitation facilities, food, child friendly spaces kits, mental health psycho-support and training of local stakeholders in mental health psycho-social support and gender-based violence referrals for the refugees.

The family visa scheme set up in response to the Ukraine war has been described as a shambles, as lawyers warn that refugees who have relatives ready to support them in the UK are being given inaccurate information, asked for unnecessary documents and told to send their passports across the continent. Nearly half of the 35,500 Ukrainians who have applied to the scheme, which was launched on 4 March, are still waiting for a decision - amounting to more than 15,400 individuals. The Independent has spoken to refugees who have been forced to pay for accommodation for weeks as they wait for their visas to be processed. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper the situation was appalling and called on the Home Office to simplify the process, adding: ""The government has had months to prepare for this, and yet delays across the system are still causing chaos and confusion. ""They should also set up emergency centres along the main travel routes to provide assistance for Ukrainians wanting to reach the UK. The Home Office's response has completely failed to meet the scale and urgency of this crisis, and it is Ukrainian families who are paying the price."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: ""As if the anxiety and uncertainty of fleeing their homes isn't awful enough, Ukrainians are being left stranded in purgatory by a visa scheme in shambles. It is simply unforgivable. ""Ministers need to drop the red tape and let refugees fleeing Putin's bombs come here without having to apply for a visa - some compassion would not go amiss, either."" Nataliia Tsvyakh, who fled from Ukraine on 24 February with her two sons, Mark, three and Denys, five - leaving her husband and parents, who did not want to leave, behind - said she was struggling to keep her children calm after waiting for weeks to join her uncle and his family in the UK. Ms Tsyakh had to wait until 17 March to attend a visa appointment to submit photographs and fingerprints. Her eldest son's passport is expired, but she was told she could attach his application with her passport, and that she would receive a decision within two days. But Ms Tsyakh has since been informed by the Home Office that she needs to submit a separate application for her son, which is delaying the case further. Her uncle, Oleksandr Khanyhin, travelled to Romania on 5 March to help her to make the application. They had been staying in a hotel in Bucharest for about Euro 70 (£58) a night, and have now moved to a cheaper hostel - the four of them staying in one room - which costs them Euro 30 per night. ""It's hard, it's like a constant pressure. Are they going to give you the visas, are they not, what are we going to do if they don't? That's at the back of our minds every day,"" Ms Tsyakh told The Independent. ""When we first left I told the kids I was taking them on an adventure. But they've seen planes flying and people crying. They're asking me why is this happening. The eldest is asking me why we're still in this hostel. I'm just trying to keep them calm and not frustrated."" In another case, Roxy Savchenko, left her home in Cardiff on 2 March to meet her sister Daryna Savchenko and her 10-month-old baby Vladyslav in Warsaw after they fled from Ukraine. She had expected to be able to return with them to the UK within a couple of days, but more than a fortnight later they remain on the continent, in Paris, dealing with a ""ridiculous"" visa process. Despite initially being told that the baby could be included on Daryna's application, on Wednesday they received an email from the Home Office stating that Vladyslav needed a separate application. They have now submitted an application for him and are still awaiting a decision. Ms Savchenko said: ""We have had enough. It's all very very difficult. None of us have to be in this situation. We could have been back in the UK three weeks ago. This is ridiculous."" Jennifer Blair, an immigration lawyer who is voluntarily advising Ukrainians trying to reach the UK via the Ukraine Advice Project, said the application process was ""chaotic"" and ""unsatisfactory"". She pointed out that a ""good chunk"" of those applying were still in Ukraine because they do not want to leave until they have somewhere safe to live, adding: ""People are at risk of death as they wait. ""This week a lot of the enquiries are about delays and there's not much we can say to people. From the beginning we have said the government should find a way to let people in and decide on their applications in-country, but there's been no sense of a crisis response."" Ms Blair described ""really horrible"" situations where some members of a family had been granted their visas and others had not. ""This is causing a lot of confusion, and there's no way to really sort it out. What happens if they leave and then their mother is killed?"" she said. The advice project had also come across a number of cases where applicants have been told they must send their passports to another country to have their visas processed, Ms Blair said, citing two cases where people applying in Poland were asked to post their passports to Germany. Kerry Garcia, another immigration lawyer supporting Ukrainians on a pro bono basis, said: ""The system is still a mess, which is making it very hard to help people. ""The emails the Home Office send out make little sense. It's impossible to contact anyone, document lists are generated asking for unnecessary documents, the online system was reset on Tuesday last week so documents we had uploaded disappeared. ""There is no clarity on the process and ultimately it is incredibly frustrating for everyone concerned. I have been practising immigration for nearly 20 years and while the system is not perfect I have never known anything as bad as this."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing horrific persecution in Ukraine can find safety in the UK. ""We have streamlined the visa application process so valid passport holders no longer have to attend in-person appointments before arriving and made changes to our forms to help people through the process as quickly as possible."" The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

The monks living at the remote 15th-century Romanian Orthodox monastery, a pilgrimage site that sits in a valley covered in dense forest, have opened its doors to people like Svetlana who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries in their millions since Russia began its invasion on 24 February. Svetlana left her home city with her daughter Anna, six-year-old grandson Maksim and two other female relatives. Anna's husband and her two siblings stayed behind, helping with humanitarian aid. ""We would go home in a second, our souls are so heavy,"" Svetlana says. ""We are sorry we had to separate from our family. Right now we feel fear and confusion, we don't know what to do next."" As she weeps, Father Gherasim Soca quietly embraces and comforts her. Later that day, villagers brave a snow storm to attend a service at which monks pray for the people of Ukraine, inside the large stone church with shimmering icons. ""The majority of people want to reach their final destination, usually somewhere in the west, as soon as possible, and if they can, they choose to spend the night near the border towns,"" says Father Gherasim. ""Putna is a little more remote, but for those who are not in a rush, they are not crowded here, each family have their own room. I see them go to church and praying, getting comfort. It helps a lot."" More than 412,000 Ukrainians have fled to Romania, where thousands of volunteers, churches, non-governmental organisations and government agencies are providing food, shelter, clothes and transportation. In northeast Romania, the Suceava and Radauti Orthodox archdiocese has offered hundreds of beds in monasteries as well as parish houses. They also have a permanent presence at the Siret border and adjacent train station including priests and monks who speak Ukrainian or Russian, offering food and help. ""A large part of Ukrainians are going to relatives who work abroad,"" says Father Alexandru Flavian Sava, the archdiocese's spokesperson. ""To them, it is more comforting to move on than stop so close to the border and the violence beyond."" Father Gherasim says roughly 100 people, mostly women and children, have so far taken shelter at Putna. Among them is a couple who come with their baby from Ivano-Frankivsk. The father used his dual Romanian passport to leave, as Ukrainian men of conscription age are not allowed to. ""We have a little girl. We left because we are afraid for us and her,"" says the father, who wishes to remain anonymous. He says they have come to stay at Putna before continuing further west because they have visited before.

Sanctions imposed by London in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine have so far focused largely on the banking and defence sectors, along with a handful of oligarchs close to the Russian president. But The Independent understands that the focus will move next week to measures directed at the energy industries which earn Russia much of its international revenues. It is hoped that these steps will have a quicker impact than the faltering campaign to freeze the UK assets of wealthy Russians, which has been slowed by legal requirements to establish a watertight case for each individual before acting. Putin cronies such as Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov are now unable to sell, rent, visit or even repair their mansions worth millions in the UK. And ministers are even talking of seizing them to use as housing for Ukrainian refugees. But with dozens of oligarchs being considered for sanction along with 350 members of the Moscow parliament, officials admit it could take months for blacklists to take effect. On Friday the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, used meetings with allied counterparts in Brussels to urge the west to wean itself off Russian energy supplies as a key means ofimposing a price on Putin for his aggression. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, did not rule out the suspension of EU gas imports, telling reporters who asked if that was an option: ""We will consider everything. Everything remains on the table."" While sanctions have disrupted much of Russia's trade with the outside world, gas and oil supplies have kept flowing, and the spike in global prices has done much to offset the impact on Moscow of losses elsewhere. The UK imports only about 3 per cent of its gas from Russia, compared to about 40 per cent for the EU, which also gets 25 per cent of its oil from its eastern neighbour. Boris Johnson has said that Europe needs to ""work together to wean ourselves off - to end the dependency on - Russian gas"", and has suggested that the UK could assist allies with renewable technologies to help make the switch from fossil fuels. And ministers have told officials working on the UK sanctions package in Whitehall that energy is an area where they want tougher action. Measures already announced in the financial sector are believed to have had a knock-on impact on Russian energy firms, for instance by stopping Gazprom from continuing to raise billions for investment from the London markets, as it has in recent years. Any direct sanctions on energy firms are likely to be taken in coordination with US and EU allies, as unilateral action might have the impact only of raising prices on the global market. Practical measures to wean the EU off its reliance on Russian energy could include a significant increase in deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from sources such as Qatar at ports across the continent, with the aim of meeting demand next winter if supplies from Russia are cut off. It is thought that EU states like Germany and Italy, which are heavily reliant on Russian gas, have enough stocks to see them through the remainder of the colder months, and there are hopes that new distribution networks could help ensure supplies of LNG are available to them by the autumn. A partial ban on Russia's use of the Swift financial transaction system has permitted continued payments for fuel. And while Russian ships are banned from docking at British ports, vessels from other countries carrying Russian gas are still allowed to unload. Dockers at the LNG terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent refused to unload tankers carrying Russian gas. Also likely to be next in line for UK measures is the services sector, with the Treasury already taking action in the insurance market and similar steps likely to follow. And legislation is expected to give longer-term effect to the exclusion of Russian aviation from UK airports, after it was initially introduced last week through temporary orders.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Aodha","UK’s Rwanda scheme ‘wrong’ and may put pressure on Ireland – Martin","Irish premier Micheal Martin has said the UK Government’s Rwanda scheme may have resulted in an increase in international protection applicants in the Republic. The Taoiseach made the comments after it emerged on Wednesday night that Ireland had a “severe shortage” of state accommodation for Ukrainian refugees. Speaking from Government Buildings on Thursday, Mr Martin said that of those at the reception centre for Ukrainians at Citywest in Dublin , 70% are now international protection applicants. “We will be analysing this, but something has happened in the last two to three months in terms of the surge within international protection applicants, something has clearly happened,” the Taoiseach said. “Anecdotally or intuitively, one can see, and maybe sense that that policy announcement, which I thought was a wrong policy announcement by the UK, a shocking sort of initiative in my view, to be doing some agreement with Rwanda, clearly may have motivated people utilising the Common Travel Area to come into the Republic – yes, I think it is one of a number of factors.” The Taoiseach made the comments as he and the Minister for Housing , Darragh O’Brien, announced a progress update on the Housing for All plan. Mr O’Brien said “real progress” had been made, “despite significant headwinds”. “Commencements are up, permissions are up, completions are up, and thankfully people are now drawing down more mortgages than they have in over a decade. First-time buyers are at their highest level since 2007.”Speaking after announcement of a 50 million euro Croi Conaithe (Towns) Fund, which aims to bring vacant and underused buildings in towns and villages back into use, Mr O’Brien said of the Croi Conaithe (Cities) Scheme: “It’s a targeted support that goes to homeowners by reducing the purchasing price of an apartment. It will directly ensure that over 5000 new apartments will be built for owner-occupiers. “I’m very glad to say, as the Taoiseach alluded to, that there has been substantial interest from the sector in this scheme, and it has the potential to bring fresh life into our cities over the coming years.” It comes as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has called on the Irish government to “urgently” provide emergency accommodation for refugees. Enda O’Neill, Head of Office with UNHCR Ireland, said the Government needed to make “significant” investment. “The Government is to be commended for its efforts to date in providing accommodation to the tens of thousands who have arrived in Ireland this year fleeing war and persecution,” he said. “However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the current approach of contracting accommodation from the private sector has reached its limits. “Significant investment is now required by the Government to ensure that it has the capacity to meet the immediate need for shelter of new arrivals and to provide safeguards for the protection of children and other categories of vulnerable people.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-07",1,"Policy"

Nadia El-Nakla, an SNP councillor in Dundee , told the Guardian newspaper her sister-in-law has been able to take refuge in Turkey with the couple’s four children, who are aged between six months and nine years. But she said her brother’s name was removed from the list provided by the Turkish administration – meaning the emergency doctor must remain in the war-torn region alongside his 93-year-old grandmother, who requires round-the-clock care. Ms El-Nakla, who is married to Humza Yousaf , is now urging the UK Government to allow those with family in Britain to live in the UK while the conflict with Israel continues. I feel like a second-class citizen in my own country, because I don’t have the right to bring my own brother to stay in my own home Nadia El-Nakla She told the Guardian: “The Ukrainian resettlement programme saved so many lives. Gazans should also have that opportunity, especially those with family in Britain. “I feel like a second-class citizen in my own country, because I don’t have the right to bring my own brother to stay in my own home. “I can see people across the street hosting Ukrainian families, and rightly so, But I can’t host my own brother, to me that feels beyond upsetting.” But Ms El-Nakla, who attended a summit of leaders’ spouses in Istanbul prior to her family’s escape, said she is “so grateful” her sister-in-law and her children are safe, adding: “My brother keeps thanking me for saving his kids.” The politician has been outspoken about her family’s situation in Gaza, regularly joining Mr Yousaf in calling for a ceasefire. Her parents – Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla – were in Gaza visiting relatives at the time of the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel and the subsequent initial retaliation. They were trapped with limited supplies for almost a month before being granted permission to leave through Egypt along with other British nationals. They returned to Dundee, but remain “traumatised” by their experience, Ms El-Nakla said, and they have now travelled to Turkey to support their daughter-in-law. Meanwhile, Ms El-Nakla said her brother continues to work in dangerous circumstances. “There’s nothing I can say to comfort him,” she told the newspaper. “I said to him remember the line from the Koran that says with difficulty comes ease, and that ease should come soon.

Mr Jenrick told the Telegraph's Chopper's Politics podcast: ""It has been a very difficult experience for them. Even the experience of coming here was traumatic. ""They spent seven hours queuing at the Polish border before they were able to finally leave Ukraine, catch the flight to the UK, and the experiences which they've had and their relatives have had in different parts of the country over the last two or three months are really harrowing."" On the process, he said: ""Truth be told it has been a bumpy start to the scheme. It's taken too long to get visas, for us it took about three weeks to get all three visas approved. ""And so there are people who are frustrated, it has tested the patience of sponsors and, more importantly, of the families and individuals themselves. ""But having been involved in some schemes that are not dissimilar to this in the past, like the Hong Kong scheme, Syrian scheme, Afghan scheme as a minister, as communities secretary, I know that. But I do think that we will get over those bumps, we are getting over them now."" Mr Jenrick said the scheme as it stands is ""overly bureaucratic"". He added: ""There were simple things that we could and should have done from the outset, like having the form in Ukrainian, for example. ""And I'm not sure whether you need to be doing checks on minors who are extremely unlikely to be threats to this country.""

But while the mother has been given permission to travel they have been told the children's applications remain ""under consideration"". Sending a photograph of her daughter to her sponsor, Lesia wrote: ""This is our beloved Martha, who painted this beautiful picture of herself on a wheat field with flag of Ukraine. ""She also said that she wants peace and wants to return to home."" How would you feel as a mother who's been offered a visa while your children are 'under consideration'. I would be desperate, and I feel helpless which is why I've helped set up this vigil. Kitty Hamilton The family are waiting in Lviv after fleeing their home in Kyiv, and are under ""enormous stress"" with a recent attack occurring near where they are staying, Mrs Hamilton said. The 53-year-old from London has organised a vigil outside the Home Office on Saturday afternoon - five weeks and one day since the Homes for Ukraine scheme started accepting visa applications - calling for an end to ""cynical and deadly"" delays. The group of would-be sponsors said they are hearing stories of ""lost visas"", frustrations at a lack of information and MPs lobbying ""fruitlessly"" on behalf of their constituents. They said they are particularly concerned about a growing number of cases where some family members have received visas while others are still waiting, despite applying at the same time. She told PA: ""How would you feel as a mother who's been offered a visa while your children are 'under consideration'. ""I would be desperate, and I feel helpless which is why I've helped set up this vigil. ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched with a spirit of Dunkirk bravado and actually 200,000 of us responded. ""We've already jumped through many hoops to get the visas done, have home inspections, pass DBS checks, daily emails to our MPs etc and here we are, still waiting. Where are the visas? It's that simple - where are they?"" The group intends to maintain a presence outside the Home Office every day between 2-4pm until the delays are resolved. A government spokesman said: ""The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-04",0,"Aid"

Government data released on Thursday shows that 104,000 people have arrived in Britain under Britain’s two Ukrainian refugee programmes – 31,300 under the family scheme and 72,700 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The figures also show that, as of Tuesday, around 198,200 applications have been made for visas , and 166,200 visas have been issued. This leaves 32,000 people still waiting for decisions on their applications, and 62,200 who have been granted but are yet to arrive in the UK. The numbers are considerably higher than the volume of people who have come to the UK under other refugee schemes. The Syrian resettlement scheme, which ended in 2021, welcomed 20,000 refugees, and the two schemes for Afghans – the Afghan Relocation Assistance Policy (ARAP) and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) – have welcomed around 19,000 so far, including those evacuated during Operation Pitting. Robina Qureshi, executive officer at Positive Action in Housing, a charity that has been matching refugees and asylum seekers with hosts in the UK for decades, said she welcomed the high numbers. But she added: “Ukrainians aren’t the only refugees. There’s this narrative that they’re the only legitimate ones, but there are many from other countries – Yemen Syria, Iraq. And they have the threat of the Rwanda plan facing them. “People arriving on the Channel are in the main refugees, either fleeing war or persecution, and they are left in limbo and fear. It’s concerning that we are unable to help them. “We hope that now that this model has been established, the government will look at Homes for Yemen, Homes for Syria, because there is no safe route for these people.” While the numbers granted sanctuary under the Ukrainian refugee schemes are relatively high, there are also concerns about the support people receive once they arrive. Data from a recent survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that only 37 per cent of Ukrainian refugees reported that they have enough money to support themselves and their dependents for the next three months. Separate data, published by the government in June, showed that 660 households who have come to Britain via the Ukraine routes have been forced to register as homeless. The Independent revealed in May that thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge in the UK had been forced to live in overcrowded accommodation, with whole families sharing single rooms. Local authorities are given £10,500 in central government funding for each refugee under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but receive no money for those arriving under the family route. Calls are mounting for councils to be given funding to support those arriving under the family scheme, and for the government to allow refugees on this scheme to be able to switch to the Homes for Ukraine route, which it pledged to do earlier this month. Labour MP Clive Betts, who chairs the Levelling Up Committee, wrote to the refugees minister last week demanding an update on when the government would fulfil its pledge to enable people to switch from the family scheme to the Homes for Ukraine scheme Mr Betts said: “As a committee, we have heard of difficulties arising with the rematching process within the Homes for Ukraine scheme when accommodation is found to be unsuitable and when there appears to be perverse application of the rules, with families unable to switch. “Refugee families need a proper home, not a hotel bedroom or temporary bed and breakfast.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-07",0,"Policy"

Many of those who are supporting Ukrainian refugees through Government schemes are struggling to afford to continue hosting people amid the cost-of-living crisis, the British Red Cross said. The charity called for hosts to be given more financial support and noted the numbers of Ukrainians facing the risk of homelessness as sponsorship arrangements come to an end.  People across the UK have demonstrated the power of kindness by opening their homes to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, but there have been various shortcomings in the UK’s response which need to be urgently addressed, finds @RedCrossPolicy #UkraineOneYearOn pic.twitter.com/ZOHYJWS62P — British Red Cross Policy (@RedCrossPolicy) February 24, 2023 The latest official figures show that 4,295 Ukrainian households have needed assistance from councils in the face of homelessness.A Government spokesperson said the fact the UK had welcomed more than 162,000 Ukrainians to safety since the outbreak of the war a year ago demonstrates “the extraordinary generosity of the British public”.They said the visa schemes specially set up for Ukrainian arrivals were “designed to address the various needs of those hoping to seek refuge here”.They added: “In all cases local authorities have a legal duty to ensure no families are left without a roof over their heads.”Gaps in support and barriers to securing accommodation are also making life hard for Ukrainian families, who are already dealing with the emotional impact of the conflictBritish Red CrossThe Homes for Ukraine Scheme sees people sponsored by a UK household for six months, while the Ukraine Family Scheme is for those with family already settled in the UK.Up to February 20, a total of 163,500 people had arrived to the UK under both schemes.There were 47,800 arrivals via the Ukraine Family Scheme and 115,800 via Homes for Ukraine.The Government noted that under the Homes for Ukraine scheme it is giving councils per-person funding, as well as £150 million to support guests into their own homes and £500 million to find housing.It also announced an increase in December in so-called “thank you” payments to sponsors of £500 a month for guests who have been in the country for more than a year.But the Red Cross said that increase could come “too late, and won’t always be enough”.We support hospitals affected by conflict not only with medical supplies, but also with forensic aspects.We donated a refrigerated container to a hospital in #Kherson region. Helping to ensure that bodies are treated with dignity is an important part of our role. pic.twitter.com/pfcKU2vj6M — ICRC Ukraine (@ICRC_ua) February 22, 2023 The charity called on the Government to clarify the details and allocation of the £150 million one-off funding for local authorities so they can address growing housing needs, and to ensure both hosts and displaced Ukrainians under the family scheme are given the same support as those on the Homes for Ukraine Scheme. The Red Cross also urged the Government to “immediately increase monthly payments for all hosts in line with the rising cost of living” and to look at schemes supporting Ukrainians with deposits to move into the private rented sector. Mike Adamson , British Red Cross chief executive, said: “One year on since the conflict in Ukraine escalated, many displaced people in the UK are still living with their hosts, finding jobs and settling into life here. “But many others are struggling. We must ensure the warm welcome shown by thousands of people is recognised and built on, so we don’t see more families facing homelessness on top of trauma. “We should not have a situation where the type of visa you arrived on determines whether or not your host family receives support. This is putting huge pressure on families in the UK who are doing their best to help, especially with rising bills and food costs. “Gaps in support and barriers to securing accommodation are also making life hard for Ukrainian families, who are already dealing with the emotional impact of the conflict.” Acknowledging the successes of the Government’s efforts towards Ukrainians, in helping them to quickly and safely escape and seek protection in the UK, the charity’s report also states that lessons could be learned for future operations. The charity said it is encouraging policymakers to consider how safe routes could be expanded to other refugees seeking safety. Mr Adamson said: “While there are problems that need addressing, the UK’s response to the conflict in Ukraine demonstrates what’s possible when we provide safe routes for people in need of protection. “Notably, no Ukrainians were recorded as crossing the English Channel according to the most recent data. The UK Government should now take stock to improve the way it responds to refugees fleeing conflict, violence and persecution in other countries too.”","Broadsheet",0,"2023-02",1,"Policy"

Myron Myronyuk stayed up all night at home in Pennsylvania as his twin brother tried to flee Kyiv , the Ukrainian capital, only to turn back because the road out was choked with traffic. His in-laws, also in Ukraine, told him they couldn't get basics like bread and milk. There was little Myronyuk could do but pray that his loved ones would survive the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A sense of helplessness overcame Ukrainians in America as the war unfolded half a world away, with little chance their loved ones in Ukraine would find refuge in the U.S. any time soon. For now, they are trying to donate money and supplies, desperately seeking advice from immigration attorneys about how to get family here and pleading for world leaders to intervene more forcefully. ""I say, 'We're praying for you, we wish you to be safe, go to a safe place,'"" said Myronyuk, pastor of St. Vladimir Ukrainian Catholic Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""We have to continue to pray and ask God for help,"" he said, but ""there's not much else we can do here."" Demonstrators gathered in Manhattan's Times Square and near the Russian Federation's mission to the United Nations on Thursday, waving blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags and denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin. About 100 people took to an overpass in Chicago , putting their hands to their hearts as the Ukrainian national anthem blared from a big speaker. ""The worst part is we cannot help them any more. We would send money, but everything is closed,"" said Chicago resident Hrystyna Klym, who has been in the U.S. for 15 years and has family in Ukraine. Klym volunteers with an organization that has regularly sent clothes, magazines, money and other items to help Ukraine's needy, particularly wounded soldiers, but she said there's no way to donate directly now. At Ukrainian Village Food & Deli in the Cleveland suburb of Parma Heights, Mila Radeva, 39, said her father - who lives near the Ukrainian port city of Odessa - had taken shelter in his basement as explosions rocked the area. ""A lot of people are going to die,"" said a worried Radeva, who emigrated to the U.S. 20 years ago. Asked if her father and other relatives might flee to another country, she said: ""There's no place for them to run."" Ekaterina Mouratova, a Miami immigration attorney, said Thursday was ""a crazy day,"" with phone calls and emails from Ukrainians and Russians seeking refuge in the United States. Ukrainians hope to flee Russian troops, while Russians worry they may get drafted and have bank accounts frozen in a wartime economy. She offered little encouragement, predicting Poland would be a far more realistic possibility for escape. ""There is no effective legal mechanism to bring people here,"" she said. Ukrainians could potentially flee their country, fly to Mexico from Europe as tourists, and enter the U.S. by land to claim asylum, as a growing number of Russians have done over the last year, Mouratova said. Fleeing war, however, is not considered legal grounds for asylum. Ukrainians could also be eligible for refugee resettlement - under which up to 125,000 can be accepted in the U.S. this year after being approved abroad - but processing has been slow as U.S. authorities focus on Afghans seeking to flee Taliban rule. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. was prepared to accept Ukrainian refugees, ""but we certainly expect that most if not the majority will want to go to Europe and neighboring countries."" Immigration advocates urged the Biden administration to grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukraine, a form of reprieve for its citizens already in the United States. The U.S. has granted TPS to 12 countries afflicted by war or natural disaster. Chicago immigration attorney Natalia Blauvelt, who also fielded calls from desperate Ukrainian clients, potential clients and friends, said they are ""absolutely devastated, extremely sad.... They are panicking because of what is happening in Ukraine, and many of them don't know what to do and help their relatives."" More than 1 million people in the U.S. report Ukrainian ancestry, according to the Census, with sizable populations in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Oksana Bilobran, an attorney in Seattle's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs, came to the U.S. from Ukraine 17 years ago. She and others have been urging elected officials to do more to support Ukraine, including securing a no-fly zone over the country and providing humanitarian protection for Ukrainians currently in the U.S. so they don't have to return. They are also working on ways to support Ukraine financially, since apps like Venmo and PayPal aren't readily available there. ""We need to up our fundraising to provide necessities, because the Ukrainian military is no match for the Russian army, so we need to provide as much help as we can here,"" she said. In Philadelphia, the United Ukrainian American Relief Committee - formed in World War II to help resettle Ukrainian refugees - pivoted to a wartime footing once again, readying a container packed with clothing, diapers, wheelchairs, medical supplies and personal hygiene items. Donations had increased over the past several weeks as Russia massed its military on Ukraine's doorstep, according to the executive director, Motrja Watters. The group plans to send the container to Ukraine, or Poland if Russia blocks humanitarian aid. Watters, whose parents were born in Ukraine, said relief groups are coordinating their response so aid is delivered as effectively as possible.

Half of all applications received by one London council were false while others were left scrambling to check the details of people who didn’t exist after government officials failed to verify prospective sponsors, a review has found. In one case, a council’s Homes for Ukraine (HfU) response team was sent to a kebab shop after fake addresses were given on the government’s expression of interest form. Another council had “Mickey Mouse” and “Vladimir Putin” sent as potential sponsors, while some refugees handed over tens of thousands of pounds to scammers. The report by migrants’ charity Work Rights Centre will be published on Tuesday but an extract shared exclusively with The Independent reveals that the Home Office had in some cases issued visas for Ukrainians before councils had time to conduct proper safety checks. The data and communication issues made exploitation a very real prospect for Ukrainians who arrived under the scheme, the charity said. Lisa Nandy MP, shadow levelling up, housing and communities secretary, said that government ministers were warned before its launch that a “DIY” Homes for Ukraine scheme would not be good enough.  “They ignored calls for the government to play a role matching sponsors and refugees and in enforcing safeguards to protect vulnerable people,” she said.  “This report lays bare the shameful consequences of the government’s failure to properly play its part,” Ms Nandy added.  The latest Home Office data on 15 December, showed 253,700 applications have been received, and 206,700 visas were granted under the Ukraine schemes. Of these, 175,000 were made and 145600 were issued under HfU. The report, titled On the frontline: London councils’ responses to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, drew from in-depth interviews with response teams from 12 council areas in London, which between them oversaw 36 per cent of HfU arrivals in the capital. Local authority officers shared disturbing examples of Ukrainian families who, eager to be matched with a sponsor as soon as possible, had fallen victim to scammers. One interviewee said: “A family paid £55,000 to someone in the UK who promised them a visa and a house. “The same thing happened to their cousin. Another person paid £2,000 for a visa, and was asked for £1,000 on arrival. We had to step in and stop it.” Without robust controls, any user with malicious intent could submit a fake expression of interest to the Department for Levelling Up, the report found.  One local government official told researchers: “At some point, there were so many applications, I thought it was Russian bots. “The so-called sponsor entries were noisy, email addresses were not real and the addresses used were often businesses ... It got to a point where we were asked to go out and visit these addresses which included a smoke shop, or a kebab shop.” They continued: “In the end, over half of the entries turned out to be completely false.” The percentage of viable hosts was much lower than the initial pool of interest, with one council estimating that “fewer than 10 per cent of sponsors who express interest actually respond”. There were also cases where real sponsors, who had volunteered to host one family, had their information used on multiple visa applications.  The report also found Home Office had often granted visas before sponsors had been properly checked, causing significant safeguarding concerns. In some cases, after sponsorship checks had failed, councils found the application had already been approved and the refugee had already arrived in the country. In at least one instance, a council had to stop a sponsorship arrangement when it came to light that the host had a criminal record.  “We have had to move a woman because of a sponsor’s DBS record,” they said. “In other cases, visas are issued for children before they are issued for parents, and the system looks like the children have left – then we call Ukraine to speak to the parents because we have interpreters, and find out that isn’t the case.” Adis Sehic, a co-author of the report, said it was clear that there was a “longer-term tension at play here between councils dealing with increased duties and responsibilities while facing diminishing resources at the same time”.  “The potential exploitation of Ukrainians highlighted by our research indicates that there has been a lack of strategic coordination at the level of central government departments, namely DLUHC and the Home Office, meaning that visa processing has been out of sync with local authority checks.” Georgia Gould, chair of London Councils, said: “Councils have faced – and continue to face – immense challenges, including in verifying information, ensuring arrivals are safeguarded, and securing appropriate accommodation for Ukrainians when their hosting arrangements come to an end.” A spokesperson for mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the report “rightly highlights that the design of this scheme left Ukrainians at risk”. “Local government and charities were forced to step in to ensure it was workable, and did an incredible job to meet the needs of thousands of Ukrainians in need of sanctuary,” they added. A government spokesperson said: “The Home Office only issues visas once robust checks have been completed. Councils are then required to conduct in-person welfare checks once a Ukrainian has arrived, and are alerted as soon as an application is made to complete DBS checks on all individuals in a sponsors’ household.” A government spokesperson added that it is “our priority has been to ensure those in danger can reach safety as quickly as possible”.

Lord Harrington, who was made a peer and appointed minister for refugees by the Prime Minister following criticism of the UK's Ukrainian refugee response, said the visa application process for those fleeing the war in eastern Europe was taking too long. But the Conservative peer told MPs that staff were working evening and weekends in a bid to speed up the process. A little under 60,000 applications have been received for both the Ukraine Family Scheme, where refugees can apply to be reunited with relatives already living in the UK, and the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, which allows individuals and other groups to offer accommodation to those wanting to travel to Britain. We have not got everything right Lord Harrington The Home Office confirmed on Wednesday that, as of March 29, the total number of visas issued was 25,500 - including 2,700 under the sponsorship scheme and 22,800 under the family scheme. Speaking to the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, Lord Harrington said: ""If I'm positive, I can say we've got 30,000 completed forms thereabouts. ""But we have not got everything right. It is not as seamless as it should be."" He added: ""We (the Home Office) are not trying to slow things up. The last time we looked, there were more than 300 staff and if we include both schemes, about 500 staff. ""We've started evening working, we've started weekend working. ""This is like an emergency operation. ""It is not that, 'Oh they will just have to wait' - it is people there who are desperate to come over, they've got through the system and we've got to get them here as quickly as possible."" Asked how many people had arrived as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, the former Watford MP said it was ""too early to publish that data"" but vowed to write to the committee by early next week with the figures. He said he hoped civil servants would be able to process 15,000 applications per week via both schemes within the next three weeks. Lord Harrington - who was previously involved in the Syrian resettlement scheme - said there was a need for security checks to ensure Ukrainians applying ""are who they say they are"", but that questions such as ""are you a war criminal?"" had been removed from the standard form that had been used. ""There has been some talk, quite correctly in my view, that the visa application process, the actual filling it out, is too slow,"" Lord Harrington added. ""I agree with that. I sat down on Saturday morning and spent just under an hour filling one out myself, and I was sitting comfortably with a cup of tea rather than being a refugee, not in the Ukraine but in Poland or wherever. ""We are going through every step of trying to shorten that form."" Emma Haddad, director general for asylum and protection at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), said the length of the form for the sponsorship scheme had been cut by a third since applications for refugees first opened after the conflict with Russia started. Earlier in the session, MPs heard how some Ukrainian refugees have been ""presenting as homeless"", despite being part of the UK Government resettlement schemes. Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA), said it was an issue councils were ""all worried about"". He told the committee that 144 Ukrainian arrivals had declared themselves homeless to 57 councils. ""Forty-four of which were from the family scheme, 36 of which were from the sponsorship scheme and 64 were from unknown or other,"" Mr Jamieson added. ""We believe there is an element of people presenting as homeless because they are coming to Ireland and then, with the free movement, able to come to the UK, so that (is) maybe an element of the unknown."" DLUHC officials said they would be working with councils to understand the ""scale"" of the problem and that local authorities would be able to fund accommodation out of their individual refugee grants. More than four million people have fled Ukraine since the fighting started on February 24, according to the UN refugee agency.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

On the day that the scheme launched, charities said that the number of refugees who will be granted sanctuary in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme will be only a ""trickle"", despite the fact that more than 150,000 people in Britain have registered to host them, because of the confusion around how they can be ""matched"" with hosts. It is unclear what action the government is taking to communicate information about the scheme to refugees stranded in Europe. The Independent revealed earlier this week that Ukrainians in Poland hoping to seek refuge in the UK had ""no idea"" how to go about it. The government said that when it launches ""phase two"" of the scheme - it is not yet known when this will be - it will work more closely with charities to identify Ukrainians in need of protection in the UK. Ministers launched the Ukraine sponsorship scheme yesterday, with the webpage stating that Ukrainian nationals and their family members may apply to come to the UK if they have a ""named sponsor"". The scheme, announced on Monday by the secretary of state for levelling up,Michael Gove, will allow Ukrainians with no family links to come to the UK and be hosted by members of the public, who will be paid £350 per month for sharing their homes. The government is yet to release data on the number of refugees who have applied to the scheme, but lawyers and charities warn that the figure is likely to be moderately low due to the lack of information on how refugees can connect with suitable sponsors. Jenni Regan, chief executive at iMix, which represents refugee and asylum charities in the UK, said that while the sector ""welcomed"" the speed at which the scheme had been implemented, there were ""concerns about just how many people from Ukraine this is actually going to help at this stage"". ""Currently, hosts need to have the name and details of the person they wish to sponsor before they can even apply, and there is no clear way of linking up with people seeking sanctuary from Ukraine,"" she said. ""The government have made it clear that they are not in a position to support the matching process, instead relying on charities [as well as] faith and community groups to provide outreach and matching opportunities."" Announcing the scheme, Mr Gove saidhe hoped individuals and community groups would be able to ""match"" with refugees using social media, adding that charities would help with the process. But Ms Regan raised concerns about this, saying that it would only benefit those who are ""digitally savvy"", and adding: ""This method is also concerning in terms of safeguarding on both sides."" Robina Qureshi, executive officer at Positive Action in Housing, a charity that has been matching refugees and asylum seekers with hosts in the UK for decades, said it had so far been contacted by 16,000 people offering to host Ukrainians, and just 160 Ukrainian refugees. ""What the government has is a spreadsheet with names on it of people expressing an interest. That register is going to go nowhere. Only a trickle of people will ever see a Ukrainian refugee,"" she said. ""Heartbreakingly, the people whose lives depend on that visa and that hosting programme are struggling and waiting. For all the goodwill that there is in the UK, the people whose lives depend on this process are not in the country."" Immigration lawyer Simon Cox, who is supporting a number of Ukrainians with applications to come to the UK, said it was ""clear"" that the programme ""hadn't been thought through"". ""There's certainly a role for the voluntary sector in the matching process, but it does need to be supervised by the government to ensure that those matches take place and are safe,"" he said. ""[The scheme] may have seemed like a great idea in turning down the political heat, but it's actually a huge operation. The government wants to go out and say they're doing something so the public move on and think about something else."" The government has said it will be working closely with charities, faith groups, universities and others to ensure people who want to help are matched to people from Ukraine. It advises on its website that if someone wishing to host does not currently know a Ukrainian refugee, they ""may wish to get in touch with charities, faith groups or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals"". Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced yesterday that the country had opened its ""super-sponsor"" scheme, meaning Ukrainian refugees can apply via the UK sponsorship scheme by selecting ""Scottish government"" on the application.

Micheal Martin, speaking in Helsinki , admitted the Republic of Ireland will face challenges housing the refugees set to arrive into the country. Around 20,000 Ukrainian refugees have reached Ireland already after fleeing Russia's invasion of their home country. It comes as Tanaiste Leo Varadkar played down suggestions Ireland may expel the Russian ambassador after two Irish diplomats were asked to leave the Irish embassy in Moscow. The move came two weeks after four senior Russian officials were asked to leave Ireland because their activities had not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour"". Mr Martin, who is visiting Finland and Estonia, said he had a ""very good"" meeting with Finland's President Sauli Niinisto. ""We had a very broad discussion in terms of the international situation, particularly the war in Ukraine and the degree to which the multilateral order has been turned upside down, the sheer barbaric nature of attacks on Ukrainian civilians and the implications for the security architecture of Europe well into the future and the capacity of open economies to continue to do what we do best,"" Mr Martin said. ""All of that is under threat by the Russian attack so we had a very interesting discussion around those issues and how all has changed in terms of this Russia attack and these implications for the future."" Asked how close Ireland is to running out of accommodation for refugees, Mr Martin said: ""What is remarkable is that over 20,000 refugees have come into Ireland from Ukraine. We have never experienced such a rapid inflow of refugees fleeing war before. ""On the accommodation front, it is stretched but then there are lots of new initiatives coming on stream. It will be difficult in the coming weeks, of that there is no doubt. ""We are bringing more staff in, particularly on the pledging side, to get through that list faster and to release homes faster for refugees coming into the country."" He indicated the Government is looking at options ""through local authorities, through vacant properties and the reconfiguration of properties"". And he said housing minister Darragh O'Brien is working to ""fast-track decisions to get facilities on stream more quickly"". He said: ""We will fulfil our obligations as best we can in relation to that and we are in close solidarity with Ukraine. ""There is no doubt that there is a strategic approach behind the Russian bombardment of cities and towns and the intimidation and desire to create migration as a leverage. ""We have got to resist that and we are all part of a community within Europe and we have stand up against that type of naked aggression. It will be challenging for us. ""This war will have impacts on us all and our challenge is to put humanity first and do everything we can to protect the lives. ""We have strengths and resources as a country and they will be stretched."" Speaking in the Dublin suburb of Inchicore, Mr Varadkar said a response from Moscow to the decision to expel Russian diplomats was anticipated. While he rejected calls for an immediate ejection from Ireland of Yury Filatov, he said expelling the Russian representative had not been ruled out. ""I suppose the reason why we don't want to expel the Russian ambassador at this stage is that if we get to that point where we're expelling ambassadors, we could see an end to diplomatic relations between the two countries. That's very hard to put back on again. We do have citizens of Russia that we want to look out for. ""And also, ultimately, there will be peace talks. There will be a ceasefire. There will be some sort of foreign peace agreement. And I don't think it would make sense for us to cut off diplomatic relations in that context."" He said he would rather ""get to the point where we have a ceasefire and where we can start to talk about de-escalation of this conflict and coming to a solution"".","Broadsheet",0,"2022-04",1,"Policy"

Before the conflict, around 76,000 international students, mostly from Nigeria and Morocco , Ghana , Zimbabwe and India , were based there.  But after grappling with racism at Ukraine’s borders while trying to flee, a large number of students are displaced in countries, including Turkey, Italy, Kenya, Romania and Belgium, unsure of their next move. Many are unable to complete their studies, battling with the mental and emotional distress of having escaped Putin’s onslaught , some are facing poverty, while others have even taken their own lives, The Independent has learned. But while Ukrainian citizens are able to receive aid from the international community, their African counterparts have been left to fend for themselves or rely on grassroots organisations for support. Speaking to The Independent from her family home in Nigeria, student Eshi, 24, said: “There were other people living in Ukraine with Ukrainians and, regardless of the colour of our passports, the colour of our skin or hair; we’re all human beings. “We actually had our lives in that country; not everyone was students, some had businesses and family members.” Following the outbreak of war, international students were advised to “go home”, however, help wasn’t forthcoming from many governments. A great number believed returning to their birth countries without a degree wasn’t a viable option and instead sought refuge in neighbouring European countries in a bid to secure future study. A key reason why many migrated to Ukraine in the first place, was the affordable tuition fees, access to special loans, and the opportunity to make better lives for themselves. International students from Ukraine are not allowed to transfer to UK universities, so the UK is a no-go zone for many of the thousands of African students seeking to finish their studies there. The only exception is the University of Manchester, which is accepting students from Ukraine who aren’t nationals of the country. While facing the prospect of repeating two years of studies due to the war’s disruption, many students have been asked by their universities to pay inflated tuition costs, an additional fee to graduate and shell out large amounts of cash for manuscripts, which they cannot afford. Anyone who falls behind with fees faces being expelled. And some Ukraine universities are forcing international students to return and sit exams before they can be awarded their degrees, The Independent has learned. Defending its decision, the Ukrainian government cited the need for “academic integrity and quality control”. However, with many students facing financial hardship and difficulty with securing visas, returning to the besieged country is not a viable prospect. As the world acknowledges the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, many students feel their plight has largely been forgotten. An earlier investigation by The Independent revealed that non-white refugees fleeing Ukraine were being detained in EU immigration facilities without reason. No one has been held accountable for this. Following social media posts about racism at the borders, The Independent interviewed students who had experienced this amid a sea of speculation from critics that the online commentary about discrimination was “lies” and a “Russian disinformation campaign”. Eventually, the United Nations released a statement acknowledging that the accounts were true and pledging to take action as celebrities, including Beyonce, showed solidarity with the international students. This week, over 70 MPs and peers, including the former home secretary Priti Patel, signed an open letter calling on the government to act now to help thousands of white Ukrainian refugees who are facing homelessness in the UK. Commentators have pointed to a disparity in public and political concern about the welfare of Black students who fled Ukraine. Korrine Sky, 27, a second-year medical student who studied in Dnipro before fleeing the war, is now based in Leicester. The Zimbabwe-British dual citizen was devastated to learn that she could not transfer to continue studying in the UK as the General Medical Council (GMC) had stopped accepting medical qualifications from her school. She has not received any support from the UK government or agencies, as citizen, since arriving back a year ago. Reconciling with the trauma of escaping war, having a gun pointed at her head and being lunged at while facing discrimination at borders, the prospect of delaying her dream of becoming a doctor has been a lot to bear, she says. “At the time I felt that I experienced an identity crisis because a major part of my identity was that of a medical student,” she said. “I pursued my hopes of becoming a doctor but I (have since) felt that I had to let that dream go in order to fully heal (...). “I’m trying to remind myself that what happened, how the war affected me, was not my fault and I’m not less of a person,” the mother-of-two added between tears. Some international students who struggled with this plight have since taken their own lives, Ms Sky said. “It’s as if the racism that was experienced in Ukraine (at the borders) is now being reinforced in several other countries,” Ms Sky said.  “We’re being told again and again: ‘Ukrainians only’. empathy is not being extended to our community because it’s not our country, as we’ve been told numerous times. “That has left many of us struggling with our mental health, but also living in different European countries without having any support. “I empathise with a lot of my peers who have resulted in taking their own lives; I have felt that depression where you’re wondering what to do next.”  A 22-year-old student from Ukraine, who fled to Portugal after the war, told The Independent that distance learning classes were not good enough and teaching support has been lacking. The student, who has dealt with flashbacks and nightmares since leaving Ukraine, said: “To the world, it might seem like this one year -but to me, it doesn’t seem like so much time has passed. “I’m out of the war zone but it still feels fresh in my memory. I’m glad that people have moved on, but the problems that Ukraine (universities) keeps bringing up, it’s not easy for some of us to move on.” The group Africans in Ukraine Education Fund (AIUEF), established by Ms Sky, is raising money for students to continue their studies and has called on global agencies and organisations to “provide fair treatment” to all students. An online petition calling on universities in the EU, Britain, and the US to put in place support packages and scholarships for African students forced to leave Ukraine has garnered almost 35,000 signatures. “We are asking that African students be offered access to university places on the same terms as their Ukrainian counterparts. Everyone should have a right to education and this should not be a right that is given to some and not others.”  The Independent has approached the United Nations, Ukraine’s government and the UK government for comment.","Broadsheet",0,"2023-02",1,"Aid"
2299,"urc_theindependent_raw2.docx","The Independent","14/3/2022","837 words","LIZZIE DEARDEN HOME AFFAIRS EDITOR","Majority of the public back those seeking refuge in UK","Three in four Britons back giving refuge to those fleeing war or persecution, new polling shows, as criticism of the government's response to the Ukraine crisis continues. An Ipsos survey found that even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a majority of Britons thought people should be able to seek refuge in the UK, and the majority had sympathy for asylum seekers crossing the Channel. Yesterday, charities and opposition parties voiced fears that the government's new sponsorship route - which will give Britons who provide homes to Ukrainianrefugees £350 per month - would be ""slow and cumbersome"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove said he hoped ""tens of thousands"" would be able to come via the route, and announced that local authority areas will be entitled to more than £10,000 per Ukrainian refugee in their area. But the Refugee Council said ministers were still putting too many ""bureaucratic hurdles"" in the way of those fleeing Russian forces and said the complex scheme ""will inevitably be restricted to those who are known to people in the UK"". In response to criticism over support for Ukrainians, the government has created a bespoke ""family scheme"" that offers three-year visas but does not amount to a grant of asylum. Experts said the government had ""misread the public mood"", as the war sparks wider questions over the UK's asylum system. A wide-ranging survey by Ipsos and the British Future think tank, which was carried out weeks before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, showed that attitudes towards immigration and asylum have warmed significantly since the 2016 EU referendum. Only 16 per cent of Brits disagreed that people ""should be able to take refuge in other countries, including in Britain, to escape from war or persecution"". Less than a third of people agreed with the statement that ""it is important to have an asylum system that deters people from seeking asylum in the UK"" while 46 per cent would rather have a fair asylum system ""even if that means allowing more asylum seekers to stay and live in the UK than we do now"". When asked about small boat crossings in the English Channel, 56 per cent of those surveyed said they had sympathy for people making the journeys, while 39 per cent said they had little or no sympathy. Mr Gove said he expects the first Ukrainian refugees making use of the government's new sponsorship route to come to the UK ""in a week's time"". The levelling up minister said he hoped individuals and community groups would use social media to connect with refugees, adding that charities would help in the ""matching"" process. Labour cautioned that ""too many questions remain unanswered"" about the new scheme. ""We're asking people to take to social media at a time they're fleeing a war zone. This is a serious crisis - it's not an online dating situation,"" shadow levelling up minister Lisa Nandy told LBC. Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, said: ""The government clearly misread the public mood about Ukrainian refugees and is now playing catch-up to make the generous offer of sanctuary that people feel is right ... underlying attitudes to immigration are becoming more positive over time."" The survey showed that the number of British people wanting general immigration reduced was at its lowest level for seven years, while a greater proportion of people said it has had a positive effect on Britain. The research involved interviewing 3,206 British adults online between 28 January and 10 February 2022, with findings weighted to reflect the population profile. Gideon Skinner, the research director at Ipsos, said: ""We know that Britons are supportive of making it easier for Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK, but this research shows this is part of a long-term belief in the principle of giving refuge to people fleeing war and persecution."" The next stage of the research, which will be published in six months' time, will show what impact the Ukraine war has had on attitudes. Polling also showed that less than a third of British people want to deter asylum seekers, as controversial new laws are to be debated in parliament. A bill being considered by the House of Lords today seeks to criminalise all refugees arriving in Britain ""without permission"" and see them deported abroad, or possibly held in offshore processing centres. The Nationality and Borders Bill has been hailed by the government as the ""cornerstone"" of its immigration plans, and names one of its key priorities as ""deterring illegal entry into the UK"". The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

Steve Billington and his Ukrainian wife Iryna Shyhera drove to Opole in Poland to rescue his brother-in-law's wife and their two young children, who managed to escape the conflict. Bohdana Shyhera and, Solomiia, aged three, and Pavlo, 13, left their home in a village outside Lviv in western Ukraine after Russia invaded. Their father has been forced to stay and fight. Mr Billington and his wife drove to Calais in France after collecting the escaped family in the hope of catching a ferry to the UK, but were refused entry because they did not have a visa. They are now holed up in Hostellerie Saint Vincent in the town of Beauvais around 55 miles outside Paris while waiting for their travel documents, which is costing them around 200 per day. Home secretary Priti Patel has announced that from Tuesday Ukrainian refugees can obtain visas to come to the UK without having to visit an application centre in Europe. But Mr Billington said the reality was not that simple. Mr Billington, 58, said: ""I'm not going to put them through that again after what happened last week. ""I thought you were just going to be able to turn up at the border on Tuesday -I even booked a Euro Tunnel crossing. ""But they are saying you need some form of approval from the Home Office."" Mr Billington was initially told to drive to Brussels where the family would ""get their visas in under 24 hours."" He pleaded with border control officers to let them through, but they threatened to have them forcefully removed by French police and said they would not be able to enter in the future. Mr Billington, from Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire said: ""The situation is, we're stuck in a hotel about 50 miles from Paris and it's costing me and my wife around 200 a day. ""It seems like Priti Patel made this announcement without checking with people on the ground who are saying no you can't do that. ""So we still need to go to the visa centre in Paris to hand over their passports and have their finger prints taken. ""We're probably going to be here for another week."" A government spokesperson said: ""Last week we announced a new sponsorship route which will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored to come to the UK. ""This is alongside our Ukraine Family Scheme, which has already seen thousands of people apply, as well as changes to visas so that people can stay in the UK safely.

The charity, which has been providing cash assistance, sim cards and signposting to Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK following Russia’s invasion of the country, said payments should be given to members of the Ukraine Family Scheme in the same way that the Homes for Ukraine supporters receive cash. The Homes for Ukraine scheme, which sees Britons welcoming refugees into their homes, currently gives guests a £200 welcome payment and hosts £350 a month as a “thank you” payment for supporting the refugees. Councils also receive £10,500 under the scheme. However, under the Ukraine Family Scheme, where British-Ukrainian residents support their family who have left the nation since the invasion in February, these payments are not provided. Currently, the Government says hosts in the Homes for Ukraine scheme can receive the monthly payment of £350 for “up to 12 months, paid in arrears, for as long as you are hosting your guests and provided that the accommodation provided is of a suitable standard”. Richard Blewitt, executive director of the British Red Cross, said: “We’re encouraging the UK Government to step up its financial support given the scale of the economic crisis here in the UK and the cost-of-living crisis, particularly for the hosts. “With the Ukraine Family Scheme, which actually doesn’t involve any money from the Government, maybe the Government is going to have to chip in a bit to help those families also who are hosting many Ukrainians.” The charity has also raised concerns about the arrival of winter for Ukrainians who stayed in the country following the outbreak of the war and remain displaced six months on. Ukrainian refugees are eligible to apply for Universal Credit from day one and the PA news agency understands early payments can be made to prevent a five-week delay. Refugees in these schemes will also get an additional £200 payment while their claim is processed. A Government spokesman said: “Taken together, our generous Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family schemes are one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history, with over 175,000 visas issued and more expected to come through these uncapped routes. “We expect Ukrainians entering the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme to be primarily supported by family members, but they are also entitled to three years’ leave to remain and full access to work, study and benefits – including Universal Credit. “Local authorities have a duty to provide support to people on the family scheme, including homelessness where required.” The Disasters Emergency Committee, which raises funds for 13 charities helping Ukrainians overseas including the Red Cross, meanwhile said on Tuesday its online campaign has now reached £380 million since it was first launched. The money raised goes towards giving medical support, food, water and cash to people inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries who have been left traumatised by the conflict. It also funds keeping vulnerable people, including women, children, older people and people with disabilities, safe. Saleh Saeed, chief executive of the Disasters Emergency Committee, said: “This incredible, generous support has meant that our member charities have been able to help hundreds of thousands of people affected by this complete conflict with vital aid. “It’s enabled us to mobilise a huge response through the work of our 13 member charities and their local partners inside Ukraine, including through partnerships with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and by empowering local people and local organisations.” Mr Saeed added that he believed British people would still continue to donate towards the fund to help Ukrainians get through the winter despite any financial concerns they may have as a result of the cost of living crisis. “I think what we’ve seen time and time again, during major humanitarian crises overseas, is that the British public has been very, very supportive,” he said. “We’ve seen in previous financial crises, whether that was in 2008 or elsewhere, that when it comes to humanitarian action, the UK public are very supportive and do recognise that despite our hardships here … people still want to reach into their pockets and give as generously as they can.” He added that those who are unable to afford to donate money find alternative ways to support the cause, such as organising fundraising events and activities. “It’s incredible, thank you to everyone that has contributed,” he added.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-08",1,"Policy"

Some nine days after collecting the keys to the Montreal Arms in Brighton , Charlie Southall decided to offer it for use as a free co-living space for Ukrainian women and children who have fled the Russian invasion. The 43-year-old has lived in Brighton for the last 15 years but grew up in poverty and spent a summer living in a women's refuge in Stafford when he was 10-years-old after his parents' divorce. At the time, Mr Southall received help from the youth charity The Prince's Trust , founded by the Prince of Wales , which he said hugely influenced his decision to donate the building, as he knew the positive experience that charitable intervention could have. ""Although it sounds horrific, and of course there was an underlying crisis, I have got really positive memories from that experience because it felt like a fresh start,"" he told the PA news agency. ""I've got firsthand experience of how that co-living, peer support system can really help people that are in that situation ... now I'm able to do something to help others, and you know what, it's been one of the nicest things I've done in recent times. ""I was watching the news and like all of us, I've been quite moved by the humanitarian crisis ... it really had an effect on me. ""(Donating the pub) has woken me up and I'm enjoying it, it's giving me a pleasure that I've not experienced before and it's a fortunate position to be in."" The video production company owner has started a GoFundMe page to raise £85,000 to pay for the renovations needed to turn the former pub into a usable living space. The renovation plans include creating a kitchen, a living space and a play area for children, utilising the open-plan layout on the ground floor of the building. There are already six rooms on the upper floor which will be used as bedrooms. Mr Southall said he would offer the pub for a minimum of three years, to match the Government Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme which promises a three-year visa for refugees fleeing the war. His campaign also aims to raise donations from local businesses and he would like local residents to contribute and participate in the building works. He has been in talks with various charities to help with the property once it is up and running as a community space, including how to help with language barriers and mental health rehabilitation. Mr Southall said he had been moved by the support of the local community in Brighton, and that people had offered kitchen appliances and vans to help move supplies. One woman, who owns a local pottery cafe, offered tiles with which Ukrainian children could paint and decorate their rooms.

Kevin Foster , the minister for immigration and future borders, has declined an invitation from the Home Affairs Committee to answer questions on what Britain is doing to provide support and refuge to people leaving Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. The committee said that ""given the urgency of the situation"" it had asked the minister to reconsider.  A Home Office spokesperson later told The Independent Mr Foster ""has not refused to attend but asked for a later date given this urgent work"" responding to the Ukraine situation. The department has come under criticism in recent days over its ""bespoke humanitarian route"" for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, after it emerged that the scheme excludes swathes of refugees with loved ones in the UK. Home secretary Priti Patel announced on Tuesday that it was expanding the route to include parents, grandparents, adult children and siblings of British nationals and people settled in the UK, and that a new sponsorship scheme was being established to help people fleeing the Russia invasion. But many relatives, including partners or cousins of British nationals, as well as close relatives of people in the UK on work or study visas, who are not deemed to be ""settled"", remain excluded from the scheme. Shadow immigration minister Yvette Cooper said earlier this week that there remained ""significant questions"" about ""gaps in the system and delays"", and that she remained concerned about whether this would deliver the ""much needed support and sanctuary in practice"". It also emerged on Wednesday that the helpline set up by the Home Office for Ukrainian refugees wishing to join loved ones in Britain under the new visa scheme was being manned by advisers who know nothing about the scheme. It comes after Mr Foster was criticised for suggesting that Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could apply for the seasonal worker scheme in order to get into the UK. Replying to a tweet by Labour's shadow armed forces minister Luke Pollard raising concerns that Ukrainians fleeing the conflict still have to apply for a visa to enter the UK last week, the immigration minister, in a now-deleted tweet, cited the seasonal worker scheme. The suggestion prompted calls for him to apologies - which he has not done. More than 1 million Ukrainians have already crossed the border, and the EU has said that 7 million people are likely to be displaced as a result of the conflict. Labour has today called on the government to end ""ongoing confusion"" over its policy on refugees fleeing President Putin's war by making a ""simple emergency visa"" available to all Ukrainians that need sanctuary and protection in the UK. Despite the commitments made by the prime minister to join other countries in providing protection for those who have fled the Russian bombardment in Ukraine, the opposition party warned that the ""rhetoric does not match the reality"". Ms Cooper said: ""People need a simple and safe route to sanctuary right now. Most want to stay close to home, especially those who have had to leave relatives behind, but the UK must play its part to help people seeking support and safety in our country too. ""Despite government announcements, desperate families are finding that the rhetoric doesn't match the reality. They cannot wait for the Home Secretary's slow and piecemeal approach which just doesn't match the urgency of this crisis. Ukrainians need help right now to reach safety.""

Almost two months have passed since the war in Ukraine began, killing thousands and creating millions of refugees. Disturbing images of suspected war crimes have been shared around the world, and inevitably the conflict has an impact on children growing up in an age of renewed nuclear fear. Volodymyr Muzyczka, a board member of the UK-based Association of Ukrainians, was looking forward to visiting Ukraine at Easter with his family, having missed out on seeing relatives back home for the three years due to the pandemic. But instead of playing with his cousins in his father's homeland, his seven-year-old son is ""continually worried"" about the war. ""When everything kicked off we tried to keep [information] from him as much as possible, we wouldn't listen to the news, we turned the radio down,"" says Mr Muzyczka. After hearing people talk about the war at school, his son came home very upset, worried the Russian army would come to kill him, ""because I'm Ukrainian and I've been to Ukraine"". ""It takes you down a blind alley,"" the 60-year-old says, as he speaks about how difficult it is to have such conversations with a child. His son also asked him what a nuclear bomb was one night as he was falling asleep, having heard friends at school talk about it. Fears of a full-blown nuclear war were triggered after Vladimir Putin put his nuclear deterrent forces on high alert in the first few weeks of war. ""There are some kids whose TV is on at home and the kids have taken it in via osmosis, and then sometimes kids are nasty and may bring it up in a way that is hurtful. He's had a few incidents like that."" Olena Davie, 44, a British Ukrainian mother of two teenage girls, says her daughters have also experienced upsetting encounters with their classmates about the conflict. When the war broke out in February, Ms Davie says her girls were ""heartbroken, of course"". ""They were crying a lot and supporting me,"" she says. ""Their cousin had to cross the border with just her dog and a little suitcase - she's just 15."" Considering the difficult news they were confronted with, they have been saddened by the lack of awareness from local children. ""They came home from school and were quite upset cause other kids were just laughing and making jokes about it,"" Ms Davie says as she reveals her youngest daughter, aged 13, felt the need to defend Ukraine to her class. ""Some of her classmates were laughing at bombs falling in Ukraine, she was quite emotional. ""She stood up in the class and said, 'How dare you? You don't know what's happening, you don't know the fears'. I was very proud of my daughter for standing up for what she believes in. She's one of those kids who doesn't normally speak up, she is very quiet."" The 44-year-old comforted her daughters by telling them their classmates were not mature enough to understand the situation. Teachers navigate the conflict Adam Gill, assistant principal of Penistone Grammar School in Barnsley, says his students seem more prepared to understand the Ukraine war because ""they're used to two or three years of bleak news and massive societal changes"". However, he is still faced with many questions such as: ""Is it going to continue or are we going to be expected to fight? Is conscription going to happen again?"" As a history teacher, he says he has seen his students making connections between the rise of Hitler and Putin's invasion. ""The students made the link of how it started with one area and then expanded without us having to point it out."" Sean Connolly, 32, is a primary school teacher at Eastbury Community School in east London. He describes comforting a six-year-old girl in his Year Two class after her mother told him she was very upset seeing the news. ""Her main fear seemed to come from, 'Will it happen to us, why is it happening, why aren't we fighting as well with them?'"" he says. ""She accepted that it's not going to come here and it won't affect her day-to-day life,"" he adds, ""but not the deeper reasons of why it's happening. When we were younger, when we [Britain] were involved actively in the military, the news that came from it seemed like we had to do it for our own safety. ""But the narrative is so different now, people who are being invaded are seen as victims, but we're not getting involved in the military. It's tough for them to get their head around."" Gurpreet Gill is the head of geography at the same school. She says a Polish student in her GCSE class expressed concern for what may happen if her country is dragged into the conflict, worrying that her family will have to go back there. As well as reassuring her student, the geography teacher says it is important to ""focus on raising awareness and listening to key facts rather than fake news"", adding that she reminds her pupils to be wary of polarising narratives that have come out of the war. She told her students: ""Don't go round and say to any of the Russian students that this is your fault. Their lives are also being ripped apart."" She also notes there are more observations on the difference in treatment between Ukrainian refugees and other war-torn countries among older students. ""They immediately picked up on the fact that Europe has been a lot more warming and welcoming to Ukrainian refugees compared to Syria,"" Ms Gill says, with one student branding the different response as Islamophobic. Others have asked if Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war would end up in the Channel, like in images they had seen before of young Syrian children found swept ashore. Ms Gill says the school ""does not shy away from these topics"" and has tried to have ""open and frank conversations"" with students, ensuring they are ""as unbiased as possible"". ""Students see a lot of these things and they don't quite understand so it's for us to navigate that for them,"" she adds. Adam Gill, from Penistone Grammar School, works for Minds Ahead, a social enterprise that supports the mental health needs of schools. He gave the following advice to parents and teachers when speaking about the conflict to children: ""It is important that we educate ourselves so we are in the position to have those answers and relieve those anxieties. ""Social media can be an echo chamber, so engage with the wider news. Bring them back to the here and now.

Around 200,000 people in the UK who registered their interest in hosting Ukrainian refugees through a government website after it launched two weeks ago will now be asked to sign up on a separate platform in order to be considered for a ""match"". The service will be managed by Reset Communities and Refugees, a charity leading UK community refugee sponsorship since 2018, which will receive government funding. The charity has been given an initial grant of £300,000 to help design the matching process. It will bring together sponsors and refugees and assess their eligibility and suitability for the scheme, as well as providing training and advice to the sponsors and community groups. Refugees minister Lord Harrington, who was appointed by Boris Johnson earlier this month to facilitate safe and speedy passage of vulnerable Ukrainian evacuees, said: ""I am delighted and grateful that Reset are working with us to bring more people safely to the UK.""  The Independent is also raising money for the people of Ukraine - if you would like to donate then please click here for our GoFundMe page.  The Homes for Ukraine scheme, which opened on 18 March, enables Ukrainians with no family links to come to the UK and live in homes offered by members of the public or charities and organisations. Individuals offering their homes are offered a monthly payment of £350 and local councils receive £10,500 per refugee in the first year. The scheme has attracted some criticism after minister for Levelling Up Michael Gove said he hoped individuals and community groups would be able to match with refugees using social media. Ukrainian refugees subsequently started to ""advertise"" themselves on social media in a bid to find hosts in the UK, with a swathe of unregulated Facebook pages being set up for this purpose, prompting concerns that the programme could expose vulnerable people to abuse. Prime minster Boris Johnson admitted this week that the scheme could place people at risk of abuse, and indicated that the National Crime Agency (NCA) may need to be involved to prevent this from happening. Reset said the new service would facilitate a ""rigorous"" matching system, with trained caseworkers and volunteers, led by safeguarding experts, assessing the sponsors' intent, suitability, and availability while checking that the accommodation they are offering is appropriate. The charity set up the matching website on 15 March, but will now begin the formal matching process. The website has so far seen more than 7,000 refugees register, along with more than 8,000 UK households offering places for more than 20,000 refugees. Sponsors will also need to complete an online mandatory training programme before the matching process begins. The matching team will also carry out assessments of refugees to understand their personal circumstances and if they have particular ties to a place. Once the match has been made, the sponsors and refugees will need to submit a visa application to the Home Office, and local authorities will be responsible for the formal vetting process. Kate Brown, chief executive of Reset, described the launch of the matching service as ""an extraordinary moment for the refugee welcome movement in the UK"".  ""With 200,000 people signed up to offer their homes under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and hundreds of thousands more offering support, we are in a position to help more refugees than ever before,"" she said. ""We must make sure that there are fair and rigorous systems in place to support the refugees and sponsors as they embark on this programme.""

It confirmed that the contract to use the MS Ambition, which is currently docked near Glasgow , would come to an end on March 31 this year. Neil Gray, the minister with special responsibility for refugees from Ukraine, said use of the vessel – currently home to about 1,170 Ukrainians, including 420 children – was always intended to be a temporary measure. He added that the Scottish Government would now look to make “full use” of both existing and new volunteer hosts to provide somewhere to stay for the refugees. The announcement that its use is being ended comes after ministers last month extended the contract for another ship being used to house refugees, the MS Victoria which is docked outside Edinburgh , for a further five months. Mr Gray said: “The MS Ambition was a temporary measure to ensure Scotland could respond to the humanitarian crisis facing people in Ukraine and provide an immediate place of safety for displaced people. “Our focus now is to secure sustainable longer term accommodation for the Ukrainians currently on MS Ambition and in other welcome accommodation to ensure they have the support they need to build a home in Scotland for as long as they need it. “This includes making full use of existing and new volunteer hosts.

In a speech to yesterday service at a Ukrainian cathedral in London, the prime minister said that the UK ""cannot shut our eyes"" to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he said resulted in ""the darkest times in modern memory"" for Ukrainians. At the Ukrainian Cathedral of the Holy Family, in Mayfair, Mr Johnson said the UK has a system that grants people permission to enter for the longer-term when they are in fear of persecution, to reunite with family or ""other purposes"". But this means that, under current rules, Ukrainian refugees fleeing the invasion who do not have immediate family connections to the UK will be denied entry. The European Union has agreed to host Ukrainian refugees for three years without asking them to apply for asylum, and regardless of whether they have a family connection in any of the 27 member states. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, foreign secretary Liz Truss said the UK was ""urgently looking"" at what the government can do to ""facilitate"" the arrival of people fleeing war. About 370,000 people have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin commanded the invasion, the United Nations estimates. Mr Johnson confirmed that, in response to the worry of Ukrainians in the UK about their families in Ukraine, any person settled in the UK will be able to bring their Ukrainian immediate family members to join them. His comments came afterThe Independentlaunched itsRefugees Welcomecampaign, calling on the government to set up a resettlement scheme to grant sanctuary in the UK to Ukrainians fleeing thebloody conflict. The prime minister's announcement was welcomed by the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper. But she said it ""should have happened days ago as too many desperate family members have been struggling and delays have been deeply damaging"". She added: ""We hope this announcement includes wider family as well as just the closest relatives - and it is vital that we see those details as soon as possible. ""Now, the government should also work with European countries on a wider sanctuary arrangement so the UK can also do its bit alongside others to help Ukraine."" Scotland's first minister called on the UK government to scrap visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens fleeing the conflict with immediate effect. In a tweet yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon said the Home Office must give entry now on humanitarian grounds ""to any Ukrainian seeking refuge in the UK"", and to ""sort paperwork later"". She described the UK immigration system as ""inhumane"" and ""indefensible"". In his cathedral speech, Mr Johnson also announced that the government will make £40m more available in humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Downing Street said the funding will help aid agencies respond to the deteriorating humanitarian situation, creating access to basic necessities and medical supplies such as medicines, syringes, dressings and wound care packs. Mr Johnson said: ""In the last days the world has witnessed awe-inspiring displays of bravery and heroism from the Ukrainian people in response to those who seek to obliterate their freedom by force. ""The UK will not turn our backs in Ukraine's hour of need. We are providing all the economic and military support we can to help those Ukrainians risking everything to protect their country."" The PM went on to describe Ukraine as the UK's ""neighbour"" and said that this was partly because Ukrainians have made ""immeasurable contribution to British society"". Mr Johnson said: ""We are neighbours in the words of the gospel. We are neighbours to Ukraine because Ukrainians are literally our neighbours. ""Hundreds of thousands have come to live and work in this country over the decades, making an immeasurable contribution to British society and that is the reason why we are neighbours. That's one reason."" He then went on to refer to the story of the Good Samaritan in the Bible. Mr Johnson said: ""And then we are neighbours because we share Ukrainian ideals of freedom and democracy and independence. ""We must not and cannot allow those ideals to be trampled on and crushed on our European continent and we will not - and that is the second reason why we are your neighbours. ""There is a more fundamental point and this is the point that Jesus was actually getting at in that parable of the Good Samaritan, which is that, even if we did not feel those emotional ties as we do, even if we did not have that political bond, the geo-strategic bond between us, it would still be right to help Ukraine in any way that we can."" Also yesterday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said ministers were ""urgently"" examining the current visa rules for Ukrainians fleeing war. When Ms Truss was told that anyone who has no connection to the UK cannot get in, and asked if that will be changed, Ms Truss said: ""We are looking urgently at what we can do. ""We're working with European partners about how we support refugees who are leaving Ukraine. So, yes, is the answer."" Her Labour counterpart David Lammy described the current visa restrictions for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK as ""totally unacceptable"" and ""bureaucratic"".

A furious Sir Roger Gale told the Commons that ""in any normal administration"", her behaviour would have been a resignation matter. Boris Johnson's government has been blasted as ""inhumane"" by France over its treatment of Ukrainians arriving at the port, who are being turned away and told to apply for visas in Paris or Brussels. Ms Patel has come under fire for implementing a system which is much less generous than in other European countries, resulting in just 300 being granted the right to enter Britain by Monday, at a time when Poland is hosting more than 1 million and other EU states have opened their doors to hundreds of thousands more. In the House of Commons on Monday, Ms Patel twice claimed that she had set up a visa application centre (VAC) on the way to the French port to process applications from people fleeing the Russian invasion. However, when told later in the debate that Downing Street did not believe that a VAC was yet in operation, she backtracked, telling shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper that ""we are setting up another VAC en route to Calais"". Instead of admitting that she had given inaccurate information, Ms Patel wrongly told Ms Cooper that she had already ""made quite clear"" that the centre had not yet been set up and accused the Labour frontbencher of mishearing her earlier comments.

Hundreds of Afghan families are being evicted in Berlin to create space for incoming refugees fleeing Ukraine , Foreign Policy reported. The German government justified it by saying that Afghans were being removed from ""arrival centres"" designed for short term stays. However, activists said that some refugees had been evicted from the accommodation they had lived in for years.  ""The evictions purposefully weren't publicised,"" said Tareq Alaows, a board member of the Berlin Refugee Council.  ""Some people had lived in their homes for years and were ripped out of their social structures, including children who were moved to locations far from their respective schools."" ""Few people's living conditions improved, but most were afraid to speak up, afraid it could impact their immigration status,"" Mr Alaows told Foreign Policy, explaining that around 10 residences had been emptied in Berlin. Berlin's senate department for integration, labour and social services, which oversees the housing of refugees, said that the decision was ""based on operationally necessary and difficult considerations"" and that there was no alternative because Ukrainians, including many women with children, needed a roof over their heads and a bed. ""We regret that this caused additional hardships to the Afghan families [and that] the affected people had to move out of their familiar surroundings and now possibly have to keep up with their social connections with great difficulty,"" said Stefan Strauss, the department's press secretary.  Mr Strauss said Berlin had a total of 83 different accommodations for refugees, already housing some 22,000 people, but that arriving Ukrainians needed to be consolidated to a few defined arrival centers to simplify processing. Evicted Afghans were given other ""permanent"" accommodation of equivalent quality, excluding shared bathrooms and kitchens, he added. Mr Alaows of the Berlin Refugee Council said that although the fault is not with the Ukrainian refugees, there was a difference between how they have been treated compared to Afghans fleeing home. ""The last months showed that different treatment of refugees is possible, and this needs to be systematically anchored in our society,"" Mr Alaows said. More than 160,000 Ukrainian refugees have been officially registered in Germany, but their real numbers are thought to be much higher as Ukrainians can enter Germany without visas and there are no thorough controls along the Polish-German border. Berlin has become the main gateway for tens of thousands of refugees, with around 7,500 arriving at the train station every day after the invasion began on 24 February. Because city officials were initially slow to react to the massive influx, thousands of volunteers have stepped up to help cater to refugees. In the last 10 years, around 630,000 Afghans applied for asylum in EU countries with some of the highest figures in Germany, while in 2015 the nation agreed to take in 500,000 Syrian refugees a year.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the potential extension of the visa period for Ukrainians in the UK is being kept under “consistent review”, adding that this “includes whether to require a fee”. The first visas issued as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme – launched last year following the Russian invasion – will expire in March 2025. We keep the need for a possible extension of UK sanctuary, beyond March 2025, under consistent review.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick Scottish National Party MP Patrick Grady had asked a question in Parliament about whether the Home Office would ensure there are “no fees chargeable for any extension to the Ukrainian visa schemes”. In a written response earlier this week, Mr Jenrick said: “In line with the situation in Ukraine, working closely with the Ukrainian Government, as well as our international counterparts, we keep the need for a possible extension of UK sanctuary, beyond March 2025, under consistent review. This includes whether to require a fee. “We are mindful that permission will start to expire, for the first arrivals under our Ukrainian schemes, from March 2025, and their need for certainty beyond that point to help them to plan ahead.” They are not here because they want to be, they are here because there is a war in their country and they can't go back yet Kitty Hamilton, Vigil for Visas Kitty Hamilton, co-founder of the advocacy group Vigil for Visas, has hosted a number of Ukrainian refugees, and said that so long as the reasons for Ukrainians needing to come to the UK do not change, “I don’t see why the rules for their stay should change”. She told the PA news agency: “They are not here because they want to be, they are here because there is a war in their country and they can’t go back yet. “As we said right from the beginning, the vast majority aren’t going to stay much beyond the end of this war. The problem is that we don’t know when that will be. It seems unfair to add to this insecurity with a lack of clarity on whether our guests can stay here in the UK.” A report by the National Audit Office last month said Ukrainians must be given certainty over their futures including around visa extensions. The report said: “The Government will soon need to take important decisions about the future of the scheme, including whether to extend visas beyond three years, and whether to extend funding for local authorities and sponsors, which currently finishes before visas expire.

Home Office officials are reportedly considering it as a way to prevent migrants who cannot be housed in limited detention sites from absconding.  The Illegal Migration Act places a duty on the government to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another “safe” third country.  However, as spaces in Home Office accommodation are in short supply, officials have been tasked with a “deep dive” into alternatives, according to The Times. While the preferred solution is to increase the number of detention places, electronic tagging has been mooted, as has cutting off financial allowances to someone who fails to report regularly to the Home Office. UK charity Refugee Council criticised the idea, claiming it would see vulnerable people “treated as mere objects”. Chief executive Enver Solomon said: “It’s treating people as mere objects rather than vulnerable men, women and children in search of safety who should always be treated with compassion and humanity, in the same way we welcomed Ukrainian refugees.  “This is not who we are as a country nor the Britain we aspire to be.” And a refugee who fled Afghanistan said electronically tagging asylum seekers was “completely wrong and unacceptable”. Gulwali Passarlay told The Independent the only point of the plans was to “make the public think we are doing something”, and accused ministers of being “cruel”. His friend has been forced by the Home Office to wear an ankle tag since arriving in the UK as a refugee, which Mr Passarlay says has taken a significant toll on his mental health. “How would normal people feel if they were electronically tagged just for being who they are?” he said. “We're surveilling the most vulnerable people in our society,” he added. The government’s plans emerged days after Home Office figures showed the backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times.  A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. In a bid to bring down the £6m a day cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels, ministers are trying to move migrants onto the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset.  But these efforts faced a fresh setback on Sunday as The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) sent a legal threat to the Home Office accusing ministers of “callous disregard” for the safety of those on board.  Asked about electronic tags for migrants on Monday morning, home secretary Suella Braverman said ministers are considering “a range of options”. “We have a couple of thousand detention places in our existing removal capacity,” she told Sky News.  “We will be working intensively to increase that but it’s clear we’re exploring a range of options, all options, to ensure that we have that level of control over people so that they can flow through our systems swiftly to enable us to thereafter remove them from the United Kingdom.” But Labour’s shadow employment minister Justin Madders described the plans as “just another gimmick”. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Madders said: “The only people you tag are criminals. And my understanding is that people who are coming to this country seeking asylum are not criminals. “They are usually people fleeing persecution. And if there’s a problem with people absconding, this is the first I’ve heard about it. “Clearly the solution to that is actually to get on and process the asylum applications a lot quicker than is happening. “I think this is just another gimmick that is not dealing with the root of the problem at all.” Mr Madders also said it is “pathetic” for the government to blame “lefty lawyers” and Labour for failings in its asylum policy. “They ought to own this problem,” he said. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said it is “the latest in a long line of gimmicks” thought up by the home secretary.  “It’s time they put in the hard work to clear their record asylum backlog so we can get people out of expensive hotels,” he said.  In June last year, the Home Office launched a 12-month pilot scheme to fit migrants with tags.  The tagging pilot allowed the electronic monitoring of asylum seekers who are declared inadmissible after travelling through safe countries and includes those selected for transfer to Rwanda.  The Independent revealed an asylum seeker electronically tagged by the government after being selected for removal to Rwanda was launching a legal challenge against the move. The man said that after being tortured and trafficked in Sudan and Libya he has been treated “like an animal” in the UK. A psychiatric report found that being forced to wear a tag had worsened his mental health, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder , and increased the risk of self-harm and suicide. The Home Office said it is “committed to the removal of foreign criminals and those with no right to be in the UK”. A spokesman said: “That is why we have introduced measures under the Illegal Migration Act which will ensure those arriving in the UK illegally may be detained and swiftly removed to their country of origin or a safe third country. “We are now considering a range of options to reduce the rate of absconding.”","Broadsheet",0,"2023-08",1,"Conditions"

The route will give Ukrainians without family links to the UK the opportunity come to the country in order to escape the war against Russia.  It comes after the government faced criticism for its response to the refugee crisis. Michael Gove, the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary, is expected to set out details of the new route on Monday. Prime minister Boris Johnson told MPs that the route will allow ""everybody in this country [to] offer a home to people fleeing Ukraine "". Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is entering its third week and more than two million people have fled the country. As of Monday 7 March, just 50 Ukrainians had been granted visas to enter the UK and refugees have reported facing too much paperwork to procure the visas. At the time, this was just 1 per cent of the 5,535 people who had applied to the scheme since Saturday. Here is everything we know about how the scheme will work and how you can get involved:  What is it?  The new sponsorship scheme would reportedly give British individuals, charities, businesses and community groups the opportunity to offer rooms to those escaping the conflict. According to The Daily Telegraph , ministers will announce a hotline and website where vetted individuals and organisations can offer up a space to incoming refugees. Those who enter the UK through the new route will be allowed to stay for an initial period of 12 months. They will be entitled to work, claim benefits and access public services, it has been reported. A spokesperson for the government said: ""The routes we have put in place follow extensive engagement with Ukrainian partners. ""This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops we will continue to keep our support under constant review.""  How can I help?  The government has not yet launched its webpage or hotline, but once it does, you can register to offer accommodation and employment to Ukrainian refugees. A similar sponsorship programme was launched in 2016 on a community level that allowed community groups including charities, faith groups, churches and businesses to help refugees resettle in the UK. It was launched in response to the global refugee crisis, which saw 10.3 million people become newly displaced within the year. The UNHCR estimated that by the end of 2016, the global population of forcibly displaced people grew from 33.9 million in 1997 to a record high of 65.6 million in 2016. Any member of the public could register through an online service to offer housing, work or support for resettling. These include helping people access public services, arranging transport and running errands, and welcoming people into the local area.  What is the current route for Ukrainian refugees?  As of Friday 11 March, Ukrainian refugees need to have family in the UK in order to apply for a visa to travel here. From Tuesday 15 March, they will be able to apply for the visas online. Until then, those with family links are still having to travel to visa application centres in Ukraine to give biometric information, such as fingerprints.

Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that setting up temporary police checks on border crossings would help Germany prevent the smuggling and trafficking of people. She added that the increased border checks would need to be combined with the already ongoing random police checks that are being carried out. Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic belong to the European Union's visa-free zone, commonly known as the Schengen Area. “Respective additional border police measures are currently being reviewed,” a German Interior Ministry spokesperson told the German news agency dpa. Faeser is also discussing with the Czech Republic the possibility of German police officers operating on Czech territory, similar to an agreement that Germany has struck with Switzerland.  “In close coordination with Swiss police forces, German police officers are allowed to inspect on Swiss territory and to prevent unauthorized entry (into Germany),"" the minister said. Faeser also demanded closer cooperation on migration between the EU and Turkey, and said that the current EU-Turkey deal required an “update.” The number of people who migrated to Germany in 2022 was higher than in any other year, according to the German federal statistics agency Destatis, with about 2.67 million people having entered the country in 2022. Included in the number are 1.1 million Ukrainian refugees who sought safety in Germany after Russian launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration","Broadsheet",0,"2023-09",0,"Policy"

The Financial Times first reported the chancellor will make the lifting of the cap one of the few measures to survive from Kwasi Kwarteng ’s disastrous mini-Budget, amid speculation about the “difficult decisions” that Mr Hunt and the prime minister are likely to take as they try to find up to £60bn from a combination of hikes and spending cuts. Earlier, Rishi Sunak urged banking executives “to embrace pay restraint” in order not to exacerbate inflation. The Budget is widely expected to raise finances through stealth taxes by freezing the rates at which workers begin paying higher rates of tax, with inflation and pay increases dragging more people into higher bands. But tough spending cuts are likely too, with Mr Hunt reportedly eyeing up plans to cut funding for the government’s homes for Ukrainian refugees scheme and planning to reduce funds received by councils for some of the services for refugees hosted by UK families.

Vasyl and Marina Prishchak and their three daughters Maria, 16, Sofia, 10, and Kseniia, 5, travelled from their home in Kyiv to Oahu for a long-awaited holiday visiting their friends Borys and Beata Markin in the middle of February. But, just days into their three-week trip, their dream holiday turned to heartbreak as Russia declared war on Ukraine and they found themselves watching from afar as their home country came under attack. More than one month on, with the planned vacation now over, they remain stuck in the US not knowing if their home close to a Ukrainian military base is even still standing or if they will ever be able to return home. Their cosmetics company has been forced to close and access to their finances has been cut off, according to the Associated Press. The canoe paddling community has rallied around the family in their time of need, with one local homeowner giving them a cottage to stay rent-free for as long as they need in Kaneohe. Thousands of dollars have been raised in donations to support the displaced family, with a GoFundMe organised by one local reaching more than $33,000 on Thursday. Meanwhile, others are helping them in other ways, such as supporting them with immigration questions as they apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). In early March, President Joe Biden announced he was granting TPS to Ukrainians fleeing from the war, enabling Ukrainians to stay and work legally in the US for 18 months. An estimated 75,000 people will be shielded from deportation back to the war zone because of this rule. The Prishchaks said they are thankful for the outpouring of support they have received from the local community in the US.  Mr Prishchak, who has known Mr Markin for three decades, told AP that ""this vacation changed our life"". ""We don't know how we return to Ukraine and what we will do, we will begin from zero, from scratch,"" he said. He said that he feels guilty being on a beautiful island away from his home while his fellow Ukrainian men are unable to leave the country and are now fighting on the frontline. ""It's a really terrible feeling that eats away at you from inside when you understand that all your close relatives are now in a very complicated situation,"" he said.  ""And there's no way you can help them stop this absolute insanity. It's a feeling that simply eats you up inside, you could say.  ""A horrible sensation, an inner guilt that I'm here and not there."" Ms Markin, who has lived with her Ukrainian husband in Hawaii for eight years, said she sees it as ""our responsibility to make sure they are okay here"" as they ""have nowhere to go"". Charlotte Johnson, an Oahu resident who set up the GoFundMe, called on her fellow Americans to ""bring hope to their lives by sharing our aloha"". ""Sadly, we can't help all the Ukrainians, but we can help this family of five,"" she wrote on the fundraising page. ""None of us can even imagine going on a vacation only to find the life left no longer exists."" She added: ""Even the smallest donation will make a difference. To a country half a world away, these five Ukrainians are our touchpoint.  ""Today we can help this Ukrainian family who took a vacation and will never return to the home they knew."" Last week, on the one-month anniversary of the day the war began, Mr Biden unveiled plans to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and other refugees fleeing the country into the US. He also pledged to provide $1bn in humanitarian assistance to help with the rising humanitarian crisis as more than 4 million refugees have now left their homes in Ukraine. It's a move that comes after pressure was mounting on the US from European counterparts to do more to support Ukrainian refugees.","Broadsheet",0,"2022-03",1,"Aid"

She can’t shake the memory of bombs crashing around her, the terror each time the air raid sounded and she had to sprint to the nearest shelter in Kharkiv, her home of three years as she studied medicine.  Six months on from the start of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, though the 19-year-old Nigerian has escaped to safety, she faces yet more anguish. All she wants is to be with her close family in the UK -but while Ukrainian nationals are welcomed to Britain, Samantha is being blocked from doing so. Instead, she is living hundreds of miles away in an unfamiliar city, alone. Several weeks ago, alone in her flat in Duisburg, Germany, Samantha heard fireworks going off outside during a festival. She thought the noises were explosions. “The night it happened, I was watching a movie and started hearing, ‘Boom, boom, boom.’ I had to lay flat on the floor. I called my mum, I was crying. I was telling her I don’t want to die.” The UK government announced two designated schemes for Ukrainian refugees when the war hit: one allowing refugees to join family members in Britain and the other permitting them to join UK citizens willing to host them. However, they required that the applicant either had a Ukrainian passport themselves or was travelling with or joining a Ukrainian national. These restrictions fail to take into account Ukraine’s international population. There were nearly half a million non-Ukrainians with temporary or permanent residence when the Russian invasion started, including more than 76,000 foreign students, mostly from Africa and southeast Asia. Many had chosen to study in Ukraine because they couldn’t access study programmes such as medicine, dentistry and engineering in their home countries, and the Ukrainian university fees are cheaper than in many other European countries. Data from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) shows 325,000 third-country nationals have fled from Ukraine to neighbouring countries since the start of the war. They have become, in effect, Ukraine’s forgotten refugees – though they have fled the same Russian attacks as Ukrainian nationals, they are facing barriers to starting their lives again in the UK and across Europe, an investigation by Lighthouse Reports has found.  The Independent’s Refugees Welcome campaign has called for the UK to lead the way in supporting those forced to flee the war in Ukraine.  ‘I feel very alone’  Samantha’s parents and siblings moved from Nigeria to Sheffield a year ago. They are now settled there: her parents have jobs and her younger siblings are in school. But the government’s exclusion of third-country national residents in Ukraine means she cannot join them, despite all the hardship she has faced. She describes spending two days sleeping on the floor of a metro station in Kyiv and waiting for hours on platforms in the snow due to difficulties boarding trains out of the country – something she attributes in part to racism.  “I thought applying for the scheme would work. The only logical thing I want to do is to be with my family,” says Samantha. “I want to have a normal life back. I want to go to school, I want to study. I want to have goals again. My mum is trying everything, trying to look for every option for how I can join them in the UK, but right now it seems like there’s nothing. I try not to let it get to me, but I feel very alone.” The Home Office refuses to say how many people are in the same position as Samantha – while the department publishes data on applications to the schemes from Ukrainians and their family members, those who do not fit this criteria are excluded. Nonetheless, even those who are related to Ukrainians -indicating that they should be eligible -have a far higher refusal rate than Ukrainian nationals, at 14 per cent compared with 0.4 per cent. A much higher proportion of third-country nationals with Ukrainian family members are also still waiting for a decision on their applications, at 45 per cent compared with 7 per cent.  Fleeing war for the second time  As well as tens of thousands of international students, there were more than 3,000 asylum seekers and refugees in Ukraine when war hit. Many others who moved to Ukraine after fleeing persecution in their own countries are believed to have been on work and business visas. Kamran Mehdipour, 43, had been living in Kyiv for six years on a business visa when he was forced out of his home for a second time – while this time it was Russian bombs that led him to flee, in 2016 he had been forced to escape Iran after threats from the authorities over the political campaigning of his brother, Peyman, now a refugee in the UK. Three days after the invasion started, Kamran rushed out of his rental apartment with nothing but a small rucksack and his three beloved dogs -Ice, Snow, and Darchin. He had to leave behind the grocery shop and deli he had set up in the Ukrainian capital.  “We left in a rush. With two friends, I got a lift to a place 25 kilometres from the Polish border, and we walked the rest,” he says. “I thought I would be able to go home again soon, but three months after I left, my old neighbour went to pick something up and sent me a picture of my apartment -it had been destroyed by a bomb.”  His brother Peyman, now a British citizen who owns a shop owner in Elgin, northern Scotland, contacted the Home Office helpline for advice on how his brother could join him in the UK. He says he was told he could apply under the Ukraine family scheme.  The brothers immediately booked a visa appointment at the visa centre in Berlin and met in Germany to register an application. They then waited for three months to be told they had been refused on the basis that Peyman is not Ukrainian. While Peyman is trying to appeal, Kamran is living in a makeshift refugee camp in Leer, a small town in northwestern Germany. He sleeps on a camp bed separated from other refugees by thin planks of plywood. Most people there are Ukrainians, who arrive and leave again to a new home within a matter of days, he says. Kamran has been there for more than three months. “It’s not good. I feel lost. I feel I don’t belong anywhere,” says the 42-year-old. “When I was in Ukraine I was treated like a Ukrainian. I was being taxed like a Ukrainian. But now I’m here with nothing. I share a bathroom: four toilets, six showers between 150 people.”  ‘Cruel and senseless exclusions’  Anais Crane, a caseworker at charity Here for Good, who is representing the brothers, says her team was contacted by several third-country nationals who had been residing in Ukraine lawfully and were now unable to join family in the UK. “In some cases, they have already fled persecution or internal conflicts in their country of origin, only to be forced to flee again – this time from Ukraine,” she said. “They cannot return to their country of origin.” A UK government spokesperson said they would not comment on individual cases, but added that the Ukraine schemes were designed for Ukrainian nationals and that non-Ukrainians displaced by the war could apply to come to the UK “through one of our safe and legal routes, including work and study visa schemes”. However, experts point out that these routes are difficult to access. Madeleine Sumption, of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, says: “In theory non-Ukrainians displaced by the war could apply for other visas, but this is no easy undertaking. Work and study visas in the UK are expensive. And people would either need to secure a skilled job offer from an employer who is a licensed sponsor and is willing to pay the substantial fees, or get admitted to a university or college where they can afford the international student tuition rates. There is no humanitarian visa to come to the UK.” Indeed, no such route is available to Ahmad, 35, who fled from Afghanistan to Ukraine in 2015. He had come under threat from the Taliban because his brother, Idres Bakhshi, had worked for the British army in Helmand Province and was relocated to the UK in 2014. Ahmad built a life for himself in Ukraine -– until the Russian invasion began. Unable to return to Afghanistan with the Taliban now in power, Ahmad applied to join his brother Idres, 34, who is now a British citizen living in Colchester, under the Ukraine Family Scheme. But after three months, he received a rejection letter stating that he was not eligible because neither of the brothers was related to a Ukrainian. The 35-year-old is in Hamburg, Germany, with no immigration status. He has requested temporary protection but is still waiting for a decision. He is staying with a friend of a friend but feels he has outstayed his welcome. Idres says his brother spends his days “walking around in the street, basically like a beggar”. “I work full-time,” says Idres. “I’ve been sending him money in Germany. Why should I be sending him money if he could be here, and I have a place for him to live?” he says. “I never ever thought the application would be refused. He lived in Ukraine, I’m a British citizen, I worked for the British army. I was sure it was going to be fine. When I received the refusal I couldn’t tell my brother for two days. It was so hard to tell him.” Zehrah Hasan, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which has been supporting Idres and Mohammad, said the UK government’s “piecemeal, discriminatory” Ukrainian refugee policy had led to “heartache, destitution and fear for the many refugees left stranded”. “It cannot be right that young Nigerian students, or repeat-refugees, having already fled war in Afghanistan, have been blocked from joining family in the UK. We know that many refugees are in dire straits in mainland Europe, whereas they have the community support they need to rebuild their lives here in the UK,” she added. “It's time they end the cruel and senseless exclusions built into their refugee policies.”  This article was amended on 11 March 2024 to change the name of one individual (*) to protect their identity .

Since Ukraine was invaded by Russia in February, the UN estimates that seven million Ukrainians have been internally displaced, while millions have fled the country to find safety elsewhere. Data from the Home Office revealed that, as of August 15 2022, more than 115,000 Ukraine Scheme visa-holders had arrived in the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme and Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine). The Ukraine Family Scheme allowed fleeing Ukrainians to join or accompany a UK-based family member, while the Homes for Ukraine scheme matched Ukrainians with someone in the UK willing to sponsor them and provide suitable accommodation for a minimum of six months. For Valentina Butenko, a 19-year-old student who was studying at the University of Central London at the start of the year, “2022 has been perpetual hell”. “This is probably going to sound very strange, but it’s also a year that I realised how lucky I am to be able to have things that I really love, and that I’m willing to fight for and protect,” she told the PA news agency. Ms Butenko, who has a British mother and a Ukrainian father, made the decision to return to her family home in Kyiv shortly before the war began and swapped studying for her degree for learning how to administer first aid and fire a gun. “You have this building sense of an immense responsibility to something that really matters to you and you’re afraid of losing. But you can’t quite grasp what that responsibility is,” she said. “I remember, the week before the invasion, I had a conversation with my father about what would happen and what we would do. “We both settled on the idea that if the war happened we had to stay and we had to support Ukraine. I felt we couldn’t leave.” Since the war began, Ms Butenko has worked with her father getting people to safety in the west of Ukraine or out of the country altogether, and spoke about one occasion when the pair got trapped in the middle of an aerial bombardment a few weeks into the invasion, as were moving people out of Kyiv. “The place we were staying, there was no bomb shelter and it didn’t have a basement,” Ms Butenko said. “There were air sirens. You could hear explosions happening. And I thought ‘Oh my god, if something actually falls, that’s it’. “I think it’s the helplessness for me, that’s the scariest feeling.” Despite this, she said that risking her life for her country has been worth it. “The way I dealt with the scariest moments was thinking ‘I’m doing this for Ukrainians’. “Every time I go back to Kyiv, there’s just incredible optimism. People just get on with their life and fight for it. “And I think that actually just gives such a richness to life, understanding there is nothing – no hell, no dictator and no army – that can break your willingness to live.” Ms Butenko – who flies back to the UK every few weeks to pick up supplies and medicine for people back home on the front line – added that being in the UK can sometimes be more frightening that being in Ukraine. “The one habit I kind of got into in Ukraine is that I didn’t sleep. Every few hours, I would wake up to check the news,” she said. “I needed to know, have they taken Kyiv? Do we still have a country? And I think my body’s gotten quite used to waking up every few hours. And I desperately check the news. “To be completely honest, it is much scarier for me reading about bombings sitting in London than actually being there when it’s happening.” February 24 – the day Russia invaded Ukraine – is etched into Ms Butenko’s mind. “I vividly remember waking up to something that sounded like an explosion, and I just instinctively knew ‘Oh my god, it’s begun’,” she recalled. “I looked at the news and they said that the first bombs had been dropped on Kyiv. And it was kind of a very intense sense of fear, a sense there is a possibility that I might not have a country tomorrow.” They're basically kids, but they need to be in Ukraine because it's our law. It's very tragic to see kids who need to start their life, need to make their own decisions, suffer from all the things that are going on Anna Tysovska Anna Tysovska, who worked for a beauty products company in Kyiv and fled Ukraine a few weeks after the war began, also spoke about her memories of the day Russia invaded. “Until I heard the first bombing, I couldn’t believe there was going to be a war,” the 32-year-old told PA. “I was in denial for a long time.” Ms Tysovska came to the UK in April with her mother, aunt and cousin. They were forced to leave their male relatives and friends behind after Ukraine banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country due to the war effort. “My dad is 55 and, obviously, he will not leave,” she said. “He’s really very passionate and he’s patriotic to Ukraine, but I don’t want him to fight because I know how bad things are on the front line. “My cousin, she’s 17, and finished school last year. A lot of boys, ex-classmates, can’t leave Ukraine because they are 18. “They’re basically kids, but they need to be in Ukraine, because it’s our law. It’s very tragic to see kids who need to start their life, need to make their own decisions, suffer from all the things that are going on.” Ms Tysovska and her family moved in with a host family in Cornwall in April as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. After a few months, she enrolled in a Masters programme at the local university, which she hopes can help her country from afar. “I always wanted to get my Masters in psychology,” she said. “I will hopefully write my dissertation on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and I will try to help the people of Ukraine living in the UK who suffer from PTSD. “But actually, you know, I think every Ukrainian will suffer from PTSD so I would like to help in any way I can.” She added that she wants to go “home”, despite loving the UK. “I want to go back to Ukraine. I want to build my future there. I want to help to rebuild my country.” As for Ms Butenko, she has one big hope for 2023. “I want us to win this war,” she said. “And I really mean win. I don’t just mean I want this war to end – I want us to win this war, and claim back all our territory. Because a lot of us, a lot of Ukrainians, have sacrificed a lot for this.” Ms Tysovska said: “My hope for next year is first of all (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will die. Then we will celebrate our victory in the Khreshchatyk Street (the main street in Kyiv).” She also hopes to celebrate a milestone back in Ukraine. “I want to celebrate my birthday next year in Ukrainian Crimea,” she said. “I want everyone to have their country back. I want Russia to repay for everything they’ve done. It can’t be repaid obviously, but that’s what I want. “And I want Ukrainian kids to live in a peaceful country. They deserve it because their childhoods were stolen.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-12",1,"Conditions"

With hosts facing increased pressure from the rising cost of living , many local authorities are worried that Ukrainian families will be left homeless when the initial six-month arrangements end. Refugees, hosts and councillors are also concerned about how Ukrainians will find independent accommodation in an increasingly competitive rental market.  In a snapshot survey of 64 councils, 61 per cent told The Independent that they were worried about an increasing number of Ukrainians presenting as homeless or being at risk of homelessness in the coming months. That was compared to 14 per cent who weren’t worried, and 25 per cent that didn’t respond.  Have you been involved in the Ukraine scheme? If so email holly.bancroft@independent.co.uk  The Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched on 14 March meaning the first refugees to arrive will reach the six-month mark during September.  Twenty-five per cent of sponsors said they only want to provide accommodation for six months or less, according to an ONS survey of 17,702 hosts. There are currently 86,100 Ukrainians in the UK under the scheme, 48,798 of which had arrived by the end of April.  “We’re going to see building pressures over the next few months and the government actually has no plan. There is zero plan or guidance coming out from the government,” Cllr Nesil Caliskan, leader of Enfield council, told The Independent. “If we waited for the government to act we would get to six months and we’d risk having loads of people homeless. So that’s why we’re planning our support now.” Cllr Caliskan said a “big concern” was the affordability and availability of private sector rentals, making it very hard for Ukrainian families to find accommodation. Cllr James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association which represents councils, urged the government to provide clarity on what happens next. “Councils, sponsors and Ukrainian guests all need to know what the options are at the end of the six-month initial placement period so they can start planning now.”  “There is a significant risk that -even if rematching is available -many Ukrainian families may need to present as homeless because of a lack of sponsors or other options,” he said. As of 29 July, 1335 households had presented as homeless to councils -635 of those were on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Analysis by Barnados, Labour and the Lib Dems predicts that between 15,000 and 21,000 Ukrainians could be homeless by winter, rising to more than 50,000 by the middle of next year. “Homes for Ukraine is a really strong scheme but the crisis point now is if we can’t get the refugees into independent housing,” Simone Schehtman, the lead pairer of Ukrainian refugees and hosts in Birmingham, said. “You go to the estate agent to try and get on the property ladder and the computer will just say no; you will fail the credit check and you won’t have a guarantor.” She urged ministers to allow local authorities to become guarantors of refugee’s rent and warned that if a plan was not put in place soon “six months of hard graft and good will by the British public and the government will become meaningless because we will have a haemorrhaging of homelessness”.  Alistair Carmichael MP, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said it would be “a tragedy” if any refugees were forced onto the streets, adding: “Ministers must act now.” Responding to the concerns, a government spokesperson said they disagreed that there was no plan for the future of the scheme. “The vast majority of sponsors want to provide support for longer than six months and we are working closely with councils to ensure all those who have fled Putin’s war have a safe place to live,” they said.  They emphasised that sponsors will continue to receive monthly £350 “thank you” payments for up to 12 months.  Inna Sukhoraba and her 16-year-old daughter Irynka are being sponsored by a host in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and have had trouble finding a place to rent for when their placement ends. Their host, Pilar, told The Independent: “Inna had found a place and was happy to pay six months rent in advance but then suddenly two days later the landlord decided to take somebody else. “It is very difficult for the Ukrainians who want to be independent and build their lives here. The government needs to give them support to move forward because they cannot be permanent guests. Where we live the rent is very expensive and one day flats come on the market, the next day they are gone. “As hosts, we feel that we have been sort of abandoned. They don’t have a plan for us or our guests and we are totally stuck.” Svitlana Stadnyk, who volunteers as a mediator between hosts and Ukrainians in partnerships with National Family Mediation, said she expected to see more cases in the coming months. “As the autumn comes, and as the six-month end approaches, there will be more and more people who need help resolving conflicts,” she said. “There are varying sources of tension and one is the rising cost of living. “Many hosts did not receive their thank you payments in time and they are seeing their utility prices go up going into the winter.” The government provides councils with a £10,500 support fund for each refugee on the Homes for Ukraine scheme, however, they have not yet committed to continuing the payments past 12 months -leaving local authorities unsure where the money will come from after the first year. Barnsley metropolitan borough council said it was worried about the six-month deadline, primarily due to lack of affordable, available accommodation, while Hampshire County Council said it was seeing “increasing pressure” on its services due to the number of arrangements coming to an end. East Suffolk Council said that it was concerned that the six-month mark would come at a time when families were facing challenges managing the increased cost of living, while Tandrige District council said it was worried its homeless prevention service would not be able to cope with the increased demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up said: “In the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. “All arrivals have access to benefits from day one and we are giving councils an extra £10,500 per person to cover any extra costs.”  ‘I simply could not survive the third night’  On the third night of the war, Inna decided she and her daughter Irynka need to leave. They had been staying with Inna’s parents in Berdychiv, Zhytomyr region and sat listening to the Russian planes flying over their home, petrified that bombs would fall on them.  “The first two nights Russian planes were flying over us and we didn’t know if they were going to drop bombs on us or not. I realised I simply could not survive the third night, so my daughter and I got on the train to Poland,” she said. While in Poland, she and her daughter found a placement under the Homes for Ukraine scheme but they always knew it would just be for six months. “I like British people and British culture and I am afraid to go back to Ukraine,” she told The Independent. Now, four months into the arrangement, she is trying to find a place where she can live independently. “I was a project manager for the Bank of Ukraine but now it is difficult for me here. For example, I found accommodation for my daughter and I and the first landlord agreed that we could rent the place but then something changed and she changed her mind.” “Where we live rent is very expensive to start with,” her host Pilar said. “The flats they are looking for, one day it comes on the market, the next it is gone.” “The Thank you payments that the government gives to the host, why can’t they give that to the Ukrainians who want to be independent?” she suggested. Inna is keen to find work in the UK but has struggled due to the language barrier. “I’m working on improving my English and I’m starting a business,” she said. “When I arrived in the UK, British people told me they liked my Ukrainian style and so I thought I could make Ukrainian dresses and sell them here.” She is financially supporting her sister and her parents back home in Ukraine and still has to pay for the utilities at her Kyiv flat.

As he makes his appeal, charities are calling for the Home Office’s “broken” family reunion system to be fixed. The air force lieutenant, who was granted asylum in the UK after a five-month-long campaign by The Independent, is waiting for his young family, including his wife, who are currently in Iran. He is worried that they will be forced to return to Afghanistan as their visas have run out in Iran. His story is one of thousands, it has emerged, with figures from summer 2023 showing that more than 11,000 people were then waiting to be reunited with family members in the UK. The Home Office has repeatedly refused to provide an updated figure for the visa backlog through freedom of information laws.  Charities Refugee Council and Safe Passage have called on the government to “fix and expand the UK’s broken family reunion system” in a new report, which draws on the many cases of separated refugee families that they are supporting.  The Afghan pilot said of his family: “They have been waiting for a visa for five months in Iran, but so far there is no news from the embassy and there is no guarantee it will be issued. My family are facing a lot of problems. They don’t have a proper place to live, and don’t have access to a doctor, because they are living illegally. Their Iranian visas have expired and they need to extend them, but it is impossible.  “My wife is suffering mentally and emotionally, and she is completely [without hope].” Under current rules, separated refugee children in the UK do not have the right to bring their parents into the country. Afghans evacuated from Kabul during Operation Pitting in August 2021 are also not allowed to bring their close family to the UK, and Ukrainian refugees in the UK are not able to sponsor family members to join them either.  Even those who have been granted the right to resettle in the UK can often find themselves waiting years to be relocated. And many thousands who apply for a family reunification visa are forced to wait months for a decision, despite the Home Office promising to process applications within 12 weeks.  One young unaccompanied Afghan child supported by Safe Passage, Ahmad, tried to join his older brother in the UK. His father had been killed by the Taliban and his mother was also dead but the Home Office did not accept that there were any “serious and compelling” circumstances that would necessitate a relocation to the UK.  His family reunion case was only successful after a UK judge ordered the Home Office to help.  Afghans who were evacuated to the UK during Operation Pitting are also struggling to be reunited with family members. Despite ministers promising in October 2023 that a new route would allow them to bring close family to safety, the pathway has not yet been set up.  Farhad, a teenager who was airlifted from Kabul without his parents, told The Independent: “They promised in 2021 that they’re going to bring the families, but it’s still been almost three years. “My mum and my siblings are in Pakistan because they needed a doctor and medication. But my father couldn’t get the visa to go with them. I am doing my GCSEs this month and I can’t really focus on my studies knowing that my family is struggling.” MPs and Lords wrote to the Home Office last week, calling on the government to act faster to reunite Afghan families.  Dr Wanda Wyporska, CEO at Safe Passage International, said: “Nearly three years on, it’s a national shame that Afghans, who risked so much to support UK military operations, are still waiting for a way to bring their family to safety here with them. Their family members are living in fear every day of the Taliban.” Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “The UK has clearly failed the Afghan refugees that it promised to protect, by keeping families separated for so long with no information on how they may be reunited.  “After risking everything for the UK, Afghans and their families should not be forced to make dangerous boat journeys to get here, nor should they face hostile, inhumane policies like the Rwanda plan when they do make it to the UK.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We made one of the largest commitments of any country to support people from Afghanistan, and so far we have brought around 27,900 individuals to safety in the UK, including thousands under our Afghan resettlement schemes. “In October we committed to establish a route for those evacuated from Afghanistan under Pathway 1 of the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme without their immediate family members, to reunite them in the UK. We remain on track to meet that commitment and open the route for referrals in the first half of this year.”","Broadsheet",0,"2024-05",0,"Policy"

The Friends with Benefits star was born in the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi. In 1991, when she was seven, her family fled from Soviet Ukraine to the United States.  In a new interview with Maria Shriver for Conversations Above the Noise , Kunis said: ""People were like, 'Oh, you're so Eastern European.' I was like, 'I'm so LA! What do you mean?' Like, my whole life I was like, 'I am LA through and through.'"" Kunis said that because she identified so strongly as an American, for a long time, being Ukrainian felt ""irrelevant"" to her, despite having close friends in the country and visiting it with her husband, the actor Ashton Kutcher. She said that whenever people would ask her where she was from, she'd say she was Russian for ""a multitude of reasons"". Kunis continued: ""One of them being when I came to the States and I would tell people I'm from Ukraine, the first question I'd get was, 'Where is Ukraine?' And then I'd have to explain Ukraine and where it is on the map, and I was like, 'Ugh, that's exhausting.'"" She soon realised that if she said she was from Russia , people would know where she meant. ""I was like, great, I'll just tell people from Russia,"" she said. Kunis said everything changed for her when Russia invaded Ukraine last month. ""This happens and I can't express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, 'Oh my God, I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,'"" she said. ""It was the weirdest feeling."" She said she will no longer be telling people she's from Russia. ""Hell no, I'm from Ukraine!"" she said. Kunis and Kutcher have raised over £13m to aid victims of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Last week, the couple announced that they will match donations of up to $3m (£2.5m) to help supply humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.

Around 850 people have so far been issued a visa under the Home Office 's family migration scheme, announced on Friday - despite tens of thousands with family links to the UK applying. Vadym Prystaiko said that if bureaucratic procedures were ""simplified"" it would ""definitely resolve all the issues"". He told the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday: ""I don't expect many of them to come. I don't want to see these pictures of people banging at the doors in Calais and scratching the doors which are quite sealed."" Campaigners have accused the UK of ""lagging behind"" other European countries over its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis by welcoming a ""pitiful"" number of refugees in the first two weeks of the war. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman called for ""immediate action"" to enable refugees to get their cases dealt with swiftly by removing ""unnecessary delays and bureaucracy"" in the visa application process.  The Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here .  Ombudsman Rob Behrens said: ""It is vital the Home Office acts to correct failings in its handling of visa applications, especially failings we have previously reported and which we are seeing repeated here. ""In this horrendous situation swift action is needed to make sure the process of getting a visa is simple, accessible and quick. Lives depend on it."" Hundreds of Ukrainians have arrived in the French port town of Calais since the Russian invasion began in the hope of reaching their loved ones in Britain, but have not been allowed to apply to the scheme from there. Confusion arose on Wednesday after the Home Office announced that a temporary visa centre in Lille - some 70 miles away - which was initially thought to be a facility where Ukrainian refugees could travel to submit their visa applications, would only work on a referral basis. The department was also accused of telling ""outright lies"" after The Independent revealed that a Home Office official had wrongly claimed that Ukrainian refugees in Calais could obtain free Eurostar tickets to travel to a UK visa centre in Lille - when in fact this route does not exist. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees grappled with the ""unbearable"" UK visa application process in other European countries, which has seen many forced to wait for hours in the cold and travel for miles. Refugees who attended a UK visa centre in Poland to submit applications to join relatives in the UK were told that they must travel 170 miles across the country in order to complete the process, prompting those going through the process to describe it as ""unbearable"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, described the government's approach to helping Ukrainian people as ""mean spirited"" and accused Britain of ""lagging behind our European neighbours"" in its response. ""The government's family visa scheme is extremely limited and restricted, with visas granted to hundreds of people - a pitiful number, and a fraction of the need and application numbers,"" he said. ""The government needs to urgently waive visa requirements to enable Ukrainians to travel to the UK more easily and then grant them refugee protection as quickly as possible after arrival."" Sonya Sceats, chief executive at Freedom from Torture, echoed his remarks, saying: ""This government's pitiful response to the plight of Ukrainian refugees shames Britain. ""Not only are these failing visa-based schemes causing intolerable heartbreak for Ukrainians blocked from reaching safety here by all the red tape. It is time for the prime minister to listen to the British people and abandon his insistence on visas for Ukrainian refugees."" The government's approach to the crisis came under further criticism after it emerged that home secretary Priti Patel told the Irish government she was concerned that the country's welcoming policy towards Ukrainian refugees would allow them to reach the UK by the back door. An anonymous briefing from a UK government source on Tuesday suggested that Ukrainian criminals or drug dealers could take advantage of the Anglo-Irish common travel area to gain access to mainland Britain - a suggestion was labelled as ""disgraceful"" and ""absolutely terrible"" by members of the Irish parliament. It comes after the government faced a barrage of criticism from Tory MPs over its response, with ministers accused by its own backbenchers of showing ""too little compassion"" and urged to ""get a grip"". David Cameron suggested on Wednesday that the UK should be more generous towards Ukrainian refugees, telling LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr: ""I hope [refugees minister Richard Harrington] is allowed if we want to go for shorter visas, or it's just Ukrainian passports, and perhaps something else, let's find a way to get it done."" Mike Adamson, chief executive at British Red Cross, said:â¯""Right now, as countries across Europe have done, the UK government must waive visa requirements for those fleeing Ukraine. Securityâ¯checksâ¯can still be carried out when people travel or arrive in the UK."" A government spokesperson said: ""The UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Ukraine and we have taken urgent action to process visas at speed for all those eligible to the Ukraine family scheme, while carrying out vital security checks. ""We have protected appointments at all of our visa application centres to ensure there is sufficient capacity and deployed extra staff to help people through the process as quickly as possible.""

Families looking to sponsor Ukrainian families under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have experienced delays because family members' visas are coming through at different times, with others not getting them at all. A vigil took place outside the Home Office in central London on Saturday afternoon, with attendees telling of their frustrations over a lack of information from the Government. Among those attending were Vladymir Tymashov, 35, and his wife Katryna, originally from Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, now living in Wimbledon, south-west London, who are trying to host a young mother and her two young children. The couple, who themselves have two children, told the PA news agency they applied for the scheme in March, but the family has been halted because the youngest child's visa has been delayed. Mr Tymashov said: ""The frustrating part is the mother and the eldest child received their visas and the younger child still has no feedback. ""It's frustrating, it makes us feel uncertain that we did everything right, we tried to call the Home Office but they're just saying they're trying. ""The family hoped for a quicker outcome so they are a little bit concerned and unclear about their future, they're in Poland at the moment and are waiting to come here. ""I would love the Government to speed up, maybe they need to get rid of the checks for the younger kids, some of them are a bit ridiculous."" Government figures released this week show that around 71,800 visas have been issued to Ukrainians under the Family and Sponsorship schemes, but less than a third have arrived in the UK. The vigil saw dozens of people, would-be sponsors and supporters, holding banners calling for the Government to speed up delays and improve the application process. The group intends to maintain a presence outside the Home Office every day between 2-4pm until the delays are resolved. Another, named Lucy Wells, 34, from Blandford, in Dorset, said her family applied on March 23 to sponsor two mothers and four children, aged 15 to three, from Kyiv. She said: ""I'm here today because it's been a really frustrating process and we're still waiting on visas but have been met by so many obstacles along the way. ""One of the most shocking things that we found out is on Monday we finally got an email from someone at the Home Office, who told us that the visas had been issued. ""We've only received two visa emails, so we were waiting on notification of four visas."" The refugees, have been in accommodation in Germany for a month, Ms Wells said. She added: ""It's really like they've been stuck in limbo, they're trying to adapt to something that's completely abnormal. ""They're really struggling financially and it's really difficult for them-it's really frustrating and upsetting. ""We really want to work with the family but we're getting no answers, every day feels like a second job.""

Uwandu Michael, originally from Nigeria , said he was ""really shocked"" when he realised he had been sent to a hotel around 70 miles away from other Ukrainian refugees when they were bussed out of Calais this week. The 37-year-old, who moved to Ukraine in 2009 and secured permanent residency eight years ago, said he was granted Ukrainian citizenship in late February but had to flee before he could collect his passport. As he attempted to travel across the border into Poland , he became separated from his Ukrainian ex-partner and nine-year-old daughter and has not been able to contact them since. Hoping to join his sister and cousin in London, he made his way alone to Calais, where he was helped to apply online for a visa by a charity. The majority of Ukrainians who had gathered at the port town were taken to hotels near Lille on Wednesday, close to where a pop-up visa centre is being set up, or nearer to existing centres in Paris or Brussels. But Uwandu Michael and around five other people of colour with UK relatives were taken to a hotel on a remote industrial estate near Boulogne-sur-Mer. We are alone -nobody is talking to us Uwandu Michael, a refugee from Ukraine They say they have been given no information about why they were separated and are unclear which authorities put them into the mini van. They have received no update about their visa applications or had any help from officials since they arrived. The 37-year-old told the PA news agency he feels ""tired of life, traumatised, and confused"". He suspects they may have been treated differently because of the colour of their skin, adding: ""We are alone - nobody is talking to us"". He said: ""It's like all the stress, everything is beginning again to multiply. ""I think we don't have anybody to speak to, except you... We cannot continue to be living in this kind of tense condition, coupled with what we've seen in Ukraine."" Uwandu Michael said he is desperate to reach the people who love him so they can ""heal my wounds"", and urged the UK Government to speed up the visa process. He said: ""I just want them to help us, because our situation here, we lost a lot of things... and putting me here is actually making me go crazy."" He also described experiencing discrimination when trying to get a train from Lviv, with Ukrainian women and children given priority over people of colour, including his daughter who is mixed race. He said he believes he was able to get to Poland because a journalist tipped him off that a train was leaving on another platform that most people were not aware of. Another refugee, Kevin , originally from Kenya, was three months away from completing his computer science university course in western Ukraine, where he had a temporary residence permit, when the country was invaded. He wants to continue his studies in England and join his uncle in Northampton. He believes the group were separated from the other refugees because they are not Ukrainian, which has left him feeling ""awful, neglected, angry"". He said: ""It's pretty awful, it makes us feel like we're left out. ""But all we're doing is just escaping the war and hoping for the best for ourselves."" Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said the charity had initially understood that people living in Ukraine who were not Ukrainian nationals would be eligible under the current scheme if they had loved ones in the UK. Home Office guidance says applicants must be joining UK-based family members, be Ukrainian or have an immediate relative who is a Ukrainian national who is applying to the scheme, and have been residing in the country on or immediately before January 1 2022. Her biggest fear now is what will happen to people ""who for one reason or another are at the edges of the scheme, who don't quite qualify who do have family in the UK"". Ms Moseley said the group near Boulogne-sur-Mer are ""very scared"" due to the lack of certainty. They speak English and several are students who would like to continue learning in England, but have been ""repeatedly"" asked to apply for asylum in France. She said: ""If they've got close family relations in the UK who are willing to support them, then it doesn't make any sense for them to live in France where they don't know anyone."" Asked if she believed racism may have played a part in the decision to move them to a separate location, she said: ""It's a very big coincidence that the nationality of these people is basically Kenyan, Nigerian and Yemeni. ""And it seems extremely coincidental that all the people that have been taken elsewhere are these nationalities."" Details of a separate visa route, allowing UK individuals and companies to sponsor people from Ukraine to come to the country, and who will be eligible, are due to be set out next week. A Government spokesman said: ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we've made it easier for those with Ukrainian passports to come here.

Steve Dury from Langport, Somerset, was only able to accommodate two mothers and three children from Kharkiv , Ukraine, when his ""desperate plea"" led the Home Secretary's office to intervene and see to the approval of the group's final visa application for three-year-old Egor Svichkar. Having applied for the scheme when it first opened on March 18, Egor's four relatives had been staying in Warsaw and acquired their visas by the beginning of April, but a further delay left them waiting on Egor's document until Monday. Mr Dury said the group were met with an ""impregnable wall of bureaucracy"" during the process and they considered returning to Kharkiv - a city still enduring shelling from Russian forces. ""It's been a diabolical process,"" the local government officer, 59, told the PA news agency. ""They were actively discussing (going back to Ukraine) and were so dejected by the whole thing - which is heartbreaking to think that they were going to return to a warzone because they had given up hope of ever coming to the UK. ""They're already traumatised, they spent days in the basement listening to the bombing around them, not knowing if their apartment was going to collapse on top of them... this (added) to their trauma."" The group, who arrived at Bristol airport on Tuesday, includes Liudmyla Tarasenko and her 15-year-old daughter, Daria, and Liudmyla's 27-year-old niece and Egor's mother, Yulia Svichkar - as well as 13-year-old Denys Chemodanov, whose mother is related to the family and authorised the women to take him with them. They were hoping to have the approval of Egor's visa through on Friday April 1, but ""lost all hope"" when the centre in Warsaw made an administrative error - setting the application back by a week and a half. Mr Dury paid more than £1,000 to keep the five of them housed in the Polish capital but was growing increasingly concerned for their wellbeing when Egor fell ill. He said he felt ""sheer relief"" and ""joy"" when the toddler's visa came through, but that they ""would have gotten nowhere"" without his emailing Home Secretary Priti Patel.  Mr Dury wrote to Ms Patel's office on Sunday: ""This dreadful 'Homes for Ukrainians' visa system is taking its toll. ""My family (is) in floods of tears today, just messaged me: 'What kind of hell is this?' ""(They) are about to give up hope of coming to UK, and return to Ukraine, where they have no accommodation (and) no money."" Mr Dury received a reply on Monday after a message from Ms Patel's email address asked that the case be ""followed up"". A Home Office staff member wrote back: ""Please pass on our apologies to the family for the delays in processing Egor's visa application."" ""Egor's visa was processed by caseworkers in Sheffield over the weekend and an instruction has now been sent to Warsaw to print the visa."" Mr Dury said it should not take ""high-level intervention"" to ensure refugees are allowed to come to the UK. ""I think without my desperate plea to Priti Patel's email, we'd still be waiting... We seemed to be banging our heads against a brick wall,"" he said. ""And whilst I'm glad that (the Home Office) did step in... I'm more annoyed at the very long waits and the anxiety that it's caused, particularly the Ukrainian family. ""Whether they'd ever get a visa, how long it was taking, the length of time they were staying in Warsaw. The little boy went down with a sickness because he got cold and wet. ""So I think their anxiety levels were sky-high as a result of this interminably long process... It should never have reached that stage.""

Czech police reported traffic delays, especially for trucks, after the measure became effective on Thursday at 27 border crossings, while the Austrian authorities enforced it at 11 crossings.  The checks will be initially in place for 10 days. Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia all belong to the European Union’s visa-free Schengen zone, where residents of member nations typically can cross borders without presenting passports or visas. Schengen countries have adopted temporary border controls in the past for various reasons, including to curb illegal migration and to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In the first eight hours of the checks, the Czech police said some 120 illegal migrants, including the 15 in the van, were detained on Czech territory, together with nine human smugglers. “The goal isn’t to complicate the lives of the Czech and Slovak citizens,” Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said after midnight at a border crossing. “The goal is only to make it clear to the groups of smugglers, who are the real criminals … that they have a barrier at the border.”  He spoke after Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger criticized the move of its neighbor. Until 1992, they were one country, Czechoslovakia.  Rakusan said Czech officials will negotiate further steps with the authorities from other European countries. He said the Czech Republic, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency “will do the maximum to find a Europe-wide solution.” Slovakia wants to help enforce the outer Schengen border between Hungary and Serbia to curb the flow of migrants. Interior Minister Roman Mikulec said if the talks with neighboring countries don’t result in a solution, his country will also launch border checks. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the Czech Republic accepted some 430,000 Ukrainian refugees but Rakusan said the latest measure is dealing with illegal migration. The Interior Ministry said the checks were necessary after authorities detained almost 12,000 migrants on Czech territory this year, most of them from Syria. That is more than the 8,500 seen during the previous massive migration wave in Europe in 2015, when the Czech Republic was not on the main route. Some 125 human smugglers have been arrested this year, a significant increase compared with the previous years. The ministry said that the migrants have been using the Czech Republic as a transit country on their way mostly from Turkey to the West and don’t apply for asylum in the country. Rakusan said that after his talks with German officials, “there’s, of course a threat” that neighboring Germany, a key trade partner for his country, will also start checks on the border with the Czech Republic.  “We do all we can to prevent that,” he said. The Czech Republic, together with Hungary and Poland, refused to comply with a refugee quota program launched by the EU after well over a million migrants entered the bloc in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. ___ Follow all AP stories on migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration","Broadsheet",0,"2022-09",0,"Policy"

Refugees who have fled Vladimir Putin’s deadly invasion have shared their hopes for a more peaceful 2023 as the conflict heads toward its first anniversary in February.  Despite usually celebrating Christmas on January 7 – as determined by the Orthodox Church – Kateryna Chebizhak, 34, who works as a telephone interpreter, and her seven-year-old son Kolya, are planning on spending December 25 with friends who live near them in Enfield , North London. “We have friends here that live just next door and we will meet to celebrate”, Ms Chebizhak said. “I have some presents for Kolya and we will have a nice walk, we might do some arts and crafts and play Uno.” The pair came to the UK in April after fleeing Kyiv , following short stays in Poland and Germany. She added that when she told her son that in the UK children usually receive Christmas presents on December 25, he began making a list. “Usually in Ukraine, we just get presents under the Christmas Tree in the New Year, but [in the UK] it works differently”, she said. “Now’s he waiting for his two presents and he’s really excited. As it is the school holidays, he has been writing letters to Santa Claus.” This time of the year is also tainted with sadness since Ms Chebizhak would usually spend Christmas with her family back in Ukraine, of which the exact location details cannot be mentioned for safety reasons. “Usually we have traditions where my mum (Tetiana) will always make 12 dishes which symbolise the 12 months of the year and we would make a wish on Christmas Eve and go to bed and it should come true”, she said. Ms Chebizhak added that her parents are okay, but that her mother did not put up a Christmas tree due to the ongoing war. “My sister Anna also used to live not too far from them and she also left to go to Greece with her two children, so they are alone and she doesn’t have any grandchildren nearby”, she added. “My mum and dad might sit down together and watch some movies or listen to the national anthem of Ukraine and we’ll have a call, but they are coping and doing great despite it not being a good situation.” As the pair look forward to 2023, Ms Chebizhak said she “dreams of peace in our country”.  “We really hope the war’s over and we can return to see Kolya’s dad as he misses him very much and is still in the Vinnytska region in Ukraine. Ms Chebizhak also has plans to do an interpretation and translation course to fulfill her dream of becoming a fully qualified interpreter, thanks to public donations made through a crowdfunder set up by platform Beam , which is supporting Ukrainian refugees into jobs and homes. “We are so thankful for all the kindness and support, which means I moved into my own place in November and can do my interpretation course next year”, she said. “Kolya is also looking forward to continuing with school and his football classes. We’re just trying to live a normal life.” Olha Komarnytska who lives in Birmingham with her children – Mia, 15, and Volodymyr, 13 – are also set to experience their first Christmas in the UK, alongside their host family. They arrived in the UK from western Ukraine in May of this year. “We usually celebrate Christmas in January but a think of lot of Ukrainians will celebrate Christmas in December this year because Russians celebrate Christmas in January and it’s not very good for us because we are fighting with Russia”, Ms Komarnytska, a 42-year-old cleaner said. She said that on December 25, the group are to go to Church together, followed by a Christmas dinner, which will include traditional British and Ukrainian food staples. “I plan to make cabbage with rice, meat carrot and onions and a Ukrainian salad with potato, carrot, meat, onions and cucumber,” she added.  We're so sad because we can't be with our family because my husband stayed in Ukraine and my mum, dad and brothers all stayed in Ukraine and we can't celebrate Christmas with them  Olha Komarnytska The family has already gotten into the Christmas spirit by attending a party hosted by Centrala, an art space in Birmingham dedicated to promoting Central and Eastern European art and culture, on December 19 – Saint Nicholas Day. “It was amazing and all the children there were very happy – they received a lot of presents and they saw Santa and heard Ukrainian music”, she said. “My son was sadly not at the party as he was ill but my daughter was really happy when she went.” Several people from the family will be absent from the dinner – Mrs Komarnytska’s husband Taras, her mother and father, Anna and Vasyl and brothers Dmytro and Vasyl. “We’re so sad because we can’t be with our family because my husband stayed in Ukraine and my mum, dad and brothers all stayed in Ukraine and we can’t celebrate Christmas with them”, she said, “It’s not good, we are not happy – but the situation is very bad because of the war happening in Ukraine and there is a bad situation with electricity where many don’t have any.” As for her hopes for 2023, Mrs Komarnytska said she will be “happy if I am in Ukraine”. “I want to come back to my family and spend time with my family,” she said. “It’s very important for me because my children miss their dad, grandma and grandpapa and their friends. “I think next Christmas we will celebrate in Ukraine, but we will always remember how lovely and helpful those in the UK have been to Ukrainians.”","Broadsheet",0,"2022-12",1,"Migration"

Jane Finlay, 56, criticised the Government following difficulties she faced trying to bring over a family of four women from Ukraine to the UK on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Ms Finlay said once she applied for the scheme there was ""no assistance"" from the Government in finding a family to house, so looked on Facebook where she connected with a woman called Nadia. Nadia, whose last name has not been given for safeguarding reasons, was looking to seek refuge in the UK along with her 16-year-old daughter, her sister-in-law and her 31-year-old niece after Russia launched a war with Ukraine on February 27. Ms Finlay told the PA news agency: ""It became very quickly apparent that the application process [of the family scheme] was the only support we were going to get from the Government. ""It's really cynical on their behalf because there's really generous members of the UK public trying to do something and the Government has done absolutely nothing apart from set this website up where we register. ""I have a degree, three of the family members are graduates, and it still took us 11 hours to fill in the forms. ""They had to provide information such as the father of the 16-year-old had to give written permission that she could leave the country, in English, but he's fighting in Ukraine, so it's a ridiculous thing to ask. Part of the questions seemed cut and pasted from another scheme as they were completely irrelevant, all the information we had to provide we had to give in PDF form, which adds another layer of complexity to people trying to stay online in a war zone. ""I know, anecdotally, this system ended up causing arguments between sponsors and the families coming because it's such a difficult process."" Once the visas were approved, Ms Finlay left her home in Cornwall and flew to Berlin on March 21. There she travelled to the border in Medyka, Poland, with her friend Pete Jones to collect Nadia and her family. The group then went to a visa processing centre in Berlin to skip the queues in Poland, as one of the family members had an expired passport and the family was travelling with two chihuahuas which required paperwork, but when they arrived Ms Finlay said the workers had not heard of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. They went to Calais after receiving notice the visas had been approved but did not receive them until the next day. Ms Finlay said she eventually travelled with the family from Calais to Folkestone on March 31 - nine days after meeting them at the border. The family has now settled with her and her partner Michael Whitehill in Cornwall. ""I'm still hearing daily of women and children in basements not able to come over because the visas haven't been processed. It's absolutely heart breaking,"" she said. ""We absolutely believe, it's the only way forward, this Government should waive the visa. So many people here in Cornwall who have voted Conservative all their lives are now they're saying they won't be voting Tory anymore because the Government's response has been shameful."" A Government spokesperson said: ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme was set up in record time but we acknowledge progress approving visas has not been good enough. The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system. ""We have partnered with the charity Reset Communities and Refugees to fund and provide a matching service for sponsors and refugees to ensure that matches made are suitable, safe and successful. This service will vet eligibility, assess needs, and provide training for sponsors to ensure they can support the people they host.""","Broadsheet",0,"2022-04",1,"Aid"

A tent town built at Gormanstown Barracks, in Co Meath, will open on Monday to put up arrivals. The Defence Forces-built site can accommodate 350 people. Government leaders yesterday held an emergency meeting to discuss new measures to house refugees arriving in Ireland. A temporary accommodation centre for people fleeing war was set up at Dublin's Citywest Hotel earlier this year. However, 250 Ukrainians had to kip on the airport floor this week as Citywest is now full. Ministers last night confirmed that over 160 of these had been transferred out of the airport. Some 41,000 people have come to Ireland from Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February. Of those, 30,000 sought accommodation assistance from the State. And in recent weeks, Ireland has seen a dramatic increase in the numbers seeking refuge here from countries other than Ukraine. In 2021, 2,648 arrivals sought international protection at the border, compared with 7,080 arrivals so far this year. Taoiseach Micheal Martin yesterday blamed the UK's ""shocking"" plan to deport some migrants to Rwanda for a surge of arrivals.

It is offering up to (EURO)135 per person a night to those who take them in. The move - announced on a government website - is designed to ease accommodation pressures. Some new arrivals have ended up sleeping on floors and chairs while many others are staying in tents. The call-out for ""expressions of interest"" comes as Defence Forces continue to examine all options, including buying up additional tents. Latest figures show more than 43,000 desperate refugees have come to Ireland after fleeing Vladimir Putin's war, launched in February. Around 1,400 are arriving each week and all the signs are that the numbers will not drop off any time soon. The Department of Children said it ""urgently needs to secure shortterm accommodation and ancillary services"" for Ukrainians, advising that ""turnkey"" options would be best. It advises via the Government Tenders site that ""short-term"" means the next six months or longer. Normal government rules around providing accommodation have been loosened to speed things up. The site calls for catered and noncatered accommodation which can hold at least 50 residents in double or triple rooms. Many hotels and B&B's came forward in March to strike deals with the Government when Ukrainian refugees began arriving. However, most of those contracts are coming to a close in August and it is not clear how many providers will agree to extend. A Department spokesperson said: ""As existing contracts reach capacity and/or expire, the department is continuing to proactively reach out and engage with the market in order to deliver additional capacity."" Department rates point to (EURO)135 paid per night for each single adult on a full-board basis in Dublin. And Tents an additional (EURO)25 would be paid for each additional spouse or child. The payments are likely to drop for properties outside the capital. Around 150 Ukrainian refugees arrived in Gormanston Army Camp, Co Meath, on Tuesday. They have been staying in around 40 military tents while more permanent accommodation was sourced. And further Defence Forces tents have opened at Knockalisheen Direct Provision Centre, Co Clare, to house 100. Meanwhile, under new rules, non- Ukrainians granted refugee status in other countries will need a visa to enter Ireland.

Around 10,147 Ukrainian refugees have arrived into the State so far, according to the latest figures from the Department of Justice. Hundreds of those who have arrived are healthcare workers, including surgeons, nurses, psychologists, dentists, dermatologists and GPs. And they are preparing to write to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, asking for urgent action so they can work for the Irish healthcare system, which is suffering a severe staffing crisis. Ukrainian couple Nikita Skakun, 34, and Mariia Peschanska, 25, are both qualified doctors who arrived in Ireland on March 14. They are just two of over 100 health workers who are desperate to start work, so that they can send wages home to fund their families and the Ukrainian army. The couple, who are currently living in the Imperial Hotel in Lisdoonvarna, Co Clare, are originally from Odessa, Ukraine. Mariia told The Irish Sun: ""We have a WhatsApp group chat for all of the Ukrainians who have arrived here, who used to work in the medical field. A guy in our hotel is a child surgeon, and there are dentists, psychiatrists, anaesthetists, orthodontists, nurses. It is a group of highly skilled people. ""We will be writing a letter to the Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, to make some sort of unified procedure for Ukrainian doctors because from what we have heard, doctors are very much needed in Ireland so we're hoping something will be done on the matter. ""For medics to work here, you need your medical diploma verified and you have to pass an exam. ""It's different to Ukraine, it won't be easy, unless the Government make a fast-tracking system."" Currently, most non-EU doctors need to take a test, known as the PRES exams, that would allow them to practise in Ireland. However, the exams only recently resumed after being put on hold due to the pandemic - and there are already hundreds of eligible medical graduates waiting to sit them. At home, Nikita and Mariia work at a private clinic in Odessa, where they specialise in dermatology. But now, their lives ""have been erased"" as Russian forces continue to wage war on their beloved country. The couple were on holiday in Sri Lanka when Ukraine was invaded by Putin's troops on February 24. Their flight home was cancelled so they were forced to fly to Germany, and then Ireland, where they are now living in Co Clare alongside hundreds of other Ukrainian refugees. Mariia said: ""When the war started, we were on holiday so we didn't know where to go. ""I feel that my whole life in Ukraine does not exist any more, every little ritual that we had, the work we have, the social network, our friends have all left, so we feel we have nothing left there. Our lives were completely erased. We flew to Germany for a week but we don't know German, so it would be very hard for us to integrate there and get jobs, so we decided to come to here. Ireland was one of the first countries to open its borders for Ukrainians, which really surprised us."" Nikita added: ""We didn't know much about it but it's so beautiful and we feel very lucky and welcome here."" Ireland is expected to take in around 200,000 Ukrainian refugees according to Ministers. And the couple said they have been blown away by the Irish hospitality they've experienced and the Government's handling of the humanitarian crisis so far. Mariia said: ""Everything is so organised, everyone here is so nice. ""We are very surprised how nice Irish people are, everyone is so welcoming, and pleasant to talk to. ""They are compassionate about the Ukraine situation. We were intimidated when we arrived, but they have supplied us with accommodation and food and we feel very grateful for that. ""It is amazing to see that people are so united to help Ukrainians and that they are so compassionate and determined. We really feel the support of the world right now."" Back home, Mariia's mother remains in the historic city of Odessa, in southern Ukraine, which is currently stable. Many of their friends and families are also still trapped in the war-torn country. Mariia said: ""My mum is in Odessa, she does not want to leave, because everything is relatively OK for now. She wants to stay there for as long as it will be safe for her. ""The first couple of weeks, we were so worried. It was very hard for me to talk to her, we would hear sirens in the background, and she was hiding in the bathroom, it was very scary."" The couple also have family living near the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, where dozens of people have died as result of Russian shelling attacks. Nikita said: "" am trying to get them to escape to Odessa. They can live in our flat 'cos it will be safe there. But they are old and they don't want to leave. ""They are saying they are being bombed constantly, it is hard for them to leave the city, even if they want to do so."" Mariia said the couple have been racked with feelings of ""guilt"" for not being able to return to their country and help defend their homeland against the Russians. At the moment, most men aged 18 to 60 can't leave Ukraine as they must stay and join the resistance. Because they were on holiday when the war broke, however, Nikita was unable to return. But the couple vowed to do everything they can to help their country from afar. Nikita said: ""At first I thought I should go back to Ukraine, but we decided I should stay and work so that we can send money back to our parents and the military."" In a statement the Irish Medical Council said the organisation is seeking ways to ""support doctors arriving from Ukraine into Ireland."" It said it had a ""statutory responsibility to ensure that doctors who register with the Council in order to work in Ireland meet the required standards in the interest of patient safety"".

But, as of May 19, 45,000 are in State-serviced accommodation, such as hotels and B&Bs. This number has fallen from 60,000 only last September. Around 8,000 Ukrainian people currently live in homes pledged and provided by the public. Their rooms are paid for by the State. Since March, new arrivals from Ukraine have to stay in designated accommodation centres and there are currently 6,000 there. This means 65,500 are accounted for in State-provided or pledged accommodation. The remaining 41,000 who originally arrived are classed by the Government as ""category unknown"". These have either returned home, gone to another country or are staying in privately sourced accommodation. Previous Central Statistics Office data from late last year estimated that only 78 per cent of PPS numbers which were given to Ukrainian refugees were active, a clear indication that many had left Ireland.

The Deputy First Minister revealed £615million in budget ""savings"" to help balance the books on top of £560million previously unveiled in September. The latest list includes £400million ""reprioritised"" within funds for health and social care - meaning effective cuts to mental health, social care and Covid-related spending. The cash will instead help meet the costs of rising pay offers for NHS staff aimed at averting winter strikes. Mr Swinney claimed that, without more Westminster funds, he had no option but to find more savings amid soaring inflation, the £700million extra needed for better pay deals and the bill for the Ukrainian refugees scheme And the senior Nat - standing in as Finance Secretary - blasted Tory ministers for their handling of the economy. He described it as a ""calamity giving way to austerity"" that was making the UK's financial crisis worse. They decisions are to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt put back plans for a new ""fiscal statement"" from Halloween to November 17. He is expected to set out brutal cuts and tax rises following a huge hike in the cost of government borrowing in the wake of predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous mini-budget. But Mr Swinney told MSPs he could ""wait no longer"" for the Treasury's plans to outline his own proposals. Revealing the new cuts in his Emergency Budget Review, he said: ""They are not decisions we'd wish to make. But in the absence of additional funding from the UK Government, they are decisions we are compelled to make."" He said the impact of soaring inflation meant the Scottish Budget was worth £1.7billion less than when it was set out last December. The Nats No2 added: ""There has never been a time of greater pressure on the public finances."" Pointing to the Scottish Government lacking borrowing powers to offset the cost of inflation, Mr Swinney went on: ""I must balance the books. ""But I am committed to doing so in a way that prioritises funding to help families, to back business, to provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services."" However, his cost-saving measures include cuts to frontline services, such as within the beleaguered NHS. While the health budget as a whole hasn't been cut, £400million has been shifted from key areas to afford pay deals for employees. Funds set aside for Covid measures - such as vaccines plus Test and Protect - will be slashed by £116million, while mental health will lose £38million. And £70million will be taken from social care, with the ""development"" of the SNP's flagship National Care Service now facing an unspecified delay. Elsewhere, the Scottish Government has found £150million in savings from capital budgets that pay for infrastructure projects and other investments. That includes £61million axed from the ""Net Zero"" capital budget, such as £28.5million for low-carbon buses and £14.7million from road, rail and canal eco projects. Another £10million will come from the botched scheme to give every schoolpupil a free laptop computer. are we compelled make There will also be £16million less for the R100 broadband rollout to the most remote areas. Justice, education, social security, tourism and economic development were among departments hit with extra ""resource savings"" totalling nearly £34million. But Tories hit out after it emerged the £20million earmarked for IndyRef2 had been left untouched. Shadow Finance Secretary Liz Smith said: ""Current difficult circumstances do not absolve the Deputy First Minister or his colleagues of responsibility for the position Scotland finds itself in after 15 years of their government. ""He has announced yet more huge cuts to health, education and justice. ""However, he won't touch the constitution budget. ""He made much of the fixed and finite nature of the Scottish Government's budget. But the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that he and his colleagues, not the UK Government, bear the responsibility - and that they prefer a divisive referendum to practical support measures."" Labour's Daniel Johnson said: ""The Tories' economic vandalism has pushed things to crisis point. But years of low growth and mismanagement from both our governments has laid the groundwork for this perfect storm. ""Nicola Sturgeon promised to open the books and take a Team Scotland approach to tackling the cost of living crisis. But she hasn't."" And Lib Dems leader Alex Cole- Hamilton slammed Mr Swinney over the cuts to the mental health budget. Last night medics warned the cuts risked making the situation in the NHS becoming even more ""precarious"". Dr Lailah Peel, deputy chair of BMA Scotland, said: ""Healthcare is under huge pressure so any area deprioritised will be a cause for serious concern. ""More patients are presenting with mental health issues since the pandemic and cuts to a service already on its knees could be hugely damaging."" Meanwhile, MSPs were told a ""flat cash"" funding settlement for the justice sector could lead to three or four court buildings closing and the system becoming slower. The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service, warned a Holyrood committee that costsaving options could also include reducing summary and civil cases by 25 per cent. Tory Jamie Greene said: ""I'm concerned about the effect that may have on a backlog which is already immense.""

It comes as Micheal Martin laid down his ""bottom line"" in the Cabinet dispute on reducing supports to Ukrainians and declared children must be allowed to stay in Irish schools. Last week, a row broke out between Cabinet ministers about proposals to reduce supports available to Ukrainian refugees coming here to escape the Russian invasion. Equality Minister Roderic O'Gorman wants to put a three-month limit on housing given to refugees, with the Government also discussing reducing welfare payments. Proposals to provide Ukrainian children with 'in-house' education within State accommodation has also been discussed. Earlier this week, The Irish Sun reported on concerns from Ukrainian families living here about the impact cuts to supports would have on their children. Asked about their concerns, Mr Martin ruled out children being denied access to Irish schools. The Tanaiste has also indicated any three-month time limit on housing for Ukrainian refugees would only impact new arrivals here. Asked about the threemonth housing rule, he told The Irish Sun: ""That's not contemplated for those already in accommodation. ""Close to 98,000 now have come into the country and obviously that creates its own challenges. ""The Government will continue to review this and give this consideration."" However, the Fianna Fail leader laid down his ""bottom line"" in the dispute on cutting back supports to Ukrainian people - kids must be allowed stay in Irish schools. He told The Irish Sun: ""Children coming into the country must always be educated and must always be facilitated in terms of access to schools - that would be a bottom line to me.""

The US President sounded the warning as world leaders met to discuss measures available to combat Vladimir Putin amid fears he could use the barbaric munitions. Boris Johnson warned the Kremlin dictator would face ""catastrophic consequences"" if he dared do so, as concerned western chiefs stepped up preparations to ship out hazmat suits to war-torn Ukraine. The British PM did not rule out putting boots on the ground in the event of a chemical strike, as Mr Biden warned that the West could launch a ""response in kind"" at the landmark summit at Nato's HQ. It came as Nato stepped up chemical and nuclear defences and announced 6,000 soldiers in four new battalions would head to Eastern Europe to bolster the 40,000 already facing down Putin's forces. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, pleaded with world leaders to send him ""one per cent"" of their aircraft and tanks. In other developments: l VLADIMIR Putin's spokesman declared Boris Johnson enemy number one for leading the world in response to Russia's aggression; l THE US vowed to put up 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and provide $1billion more help; l PRESIDENT Biden said the US would ship liquified gas to Europe to try to help countries wean themselves off Russia's fuel; l BRITAIN slapped sanctions on another slew of Russian oligarchs and banking chiefs, and; l RUSSIAN TV warned of nuclear war if Nato sends in troops to the region. Mr Johnson told the Brussels mega-summit of EU and G7 chiefs that using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be ""catastrophic"" for Putin. He said: ""There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that, the consequences would be very, very severe."" He added that the Alliance must maintain ""ambiguity"" to keep Putin second guessing their response. The PM pleaded with world leaders not to abandon President Zelensky - but admitted Britain could not provide him with the tanks and jets he has asked for. French President Emmanuel Macron also ruled out sending tanks and warplanes to Ukraine as it risked making the EU a ""co-belligerent"" in the war. Slovenian PM Janez Jansa warned that Russia could unleash a ""catastrophe"" on Europe by accidentally shelling a chemical plant. He told Putin such a scenario ""could"" trigger Nato's Article 5 defence clause that states an attack on one is an attack on all. The new troops announced yesterday will be posted to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Brit troops are already stationed in Poland and Estonia and will play a part in the new forces plan. But behind closed doors, officials talked down the possibility of triggering an aggressive response, saying it would make too many countries ""direct"" targets. And they admitted that the huge package of international sanctions was not pushing Putin to change his mind about the disastrous war. Senior officials also played down the prospect of putting Nato boots on the ground in Ukraine. Poland raged at other EU leaders for urging Mr Zelensky to make concessions in ongoing peace talks. President Biden would only say it was ""their judgment to make"" if they wanted to negotiate. Whitehall sources said the PM had been privately urging Mr Biden to stand firm for as long as possible, insisting Ukraine should get to decide its own destiny. In a virtual address to the allies yesterday, President Zelensky urged the leaders for ""one per cent of all your planes, one per cent of all your tanks"" but it appeared his demand would not be met. Piling fresh pressure on Western nations to step up their help he said it would show ""who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us"". Mr Johnson, meanwhile, praised the Ukrainian leader, right, saying: ""Volodymyr Zelensky has proved to be one of the most extraordinary war leaders of recent times. ""He has marshalled world opinion and mobilised his country. ""What he wants from us is more diplomatic pressure around the world. He wants tighter economic sanctions on the Putin regime. ""He wants some very specific military support, defensive military support for the Ukrainian armed forces and that we are determined to provide."" Mr Johnson hailed him as Ukraine's Churchill in their darkest hour. He told LBC: ""He knows, as Churchill said of himself, he may not have been the lion but he's been privileged to give the roar."" The PM also branded Putin a war criminal for the first time - saying he had ""crossed the red line"". But he denied he was anti Russian and said he had nothing against the innocent people who were getting dragged into the conflict by Putin. @IrishSunOnline Graphic   A UNITED STAND Johnson, Biden, Macron & other world leaders gather at Nato HQ yesterday","Tabloid",1,"2022-03",1,"Policy"

Poland received roughly 30,000 displaced Ukrainians over the first 24 hours of the war while 17,500 crossed into Moldova and several thousand more arrived in Slovakia, according to the UN refugee agency. Romania is believed to have taken 10,000 refugees so far and another few thousand have sought refuge in Hungary, which said all five of its crossings on the frontier with Ukraine were at full capacity, with traffic jams stretching for several miles on the Ukrainian side. The total is three times the lower end of the EU's forecasts for the entire conflict, which ranged from 20,000 to more than a million, raising concerns that some countries could be overwhelmed by the influx. UN agencies estimate that more than 100,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and the conflict could drive as many as 5 million to flee. The crisis comes amid growing warnings that the war in the breadbasket of Europe will lead to soaring food prices and leave millions of the world's poor ""knocking on famine's door"".UK government sources said they were not expecting an influx of refugees to move across Europe and the focus was on providing support to help Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova respond to those needing temporary homes. A total of 1,000 UK troops are on standby to support Ukraine's neighbours with refugee responses, James Heappey, the armed forces minister, told MPs yesterday. The Lib Dems and a coalition of humanitarian charities have called on the government to offer an ""ambitious commitment to resettle Ukrainian refugees in the UK"". A government source said: ""We've not seen mass movement across the border yet. The countries around Ukraine are inherently safe so the priority now is to make sure British nationals get out and are safe."" Some refugees said they had walked for 20 hours in sub-zero temperatures to reach Ukraine's frontiers. In the Polish town of Medyka hundreds of cars arrived to collect Ukrainian relatives, including several families that had been separated from their men. Marta Buach, 30, from Lviv, said her husband had been drafted before they could cross the border. Men aged 18 to 60 have been ordered to remain in the country. Pawel Szefernaker, 34, Poland's deputy interior minister, said male Ukrainian coach drivers had been among those prevented from leaving and Ukrainian men in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic travelled home as they received conscription papers. The World Food Programme said the Black Sea basin was one of the world's most important areas for grain and agricultural production. ""We have 283 million people marching towards starvation with 45 million knocking on famine's door,"" it said in a statement.

Almost 2,000 have been offered so far, with many second-home owners pledging their properties to the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme for the next six months. Leeds and Wiltshire were the next most welcoming councils with each accounting for more than 1,500 homes, according to data shared with The Times. There were also a large number of offers in Winchester and Dorset. Cornwall was also responsible for a similarly large proportion of offers made to 666 people resettled under a community sponsorship scheme for Syrian refugees in 2016. Derek Thomas, the Conservative MP for St Ives, said that he had encouraged second-home owners to volunteer their properties in the county because he believed it would bring together communities that had become divided between locals and those whose main residence is in London or elsewhere. He said: ""It's of no surprise but it's great to hear that Cornwall has responded quickly and generously to the difficult situation that refugees face in Poland and other border countries. The use of second homes is something I've encouraged and it makes common sense for people who own property in Cornwall to offer homes in this way. I know that the communities will do everything they can to support and welcome refugees and they'll be very welcome. ""The negative problem we have with homes that aren't permanently lived in is they are right in the middle of communities and at some times of the year it can leave communities quite empty."" Linzi Hanscomb, founder of Newquay Refugee Support Group, said that it had been contacted by several second home-owners offering their accommodation to Ukrainian refugees for six months. ""We have never had that before,"" she said. ""We have several people who have empty cottages or flats which they would normally rent out or let their family use. There is this massive flurry of interest."" Hanscomb said it had taken about 18 months in the past to go through the government and council processes to permanently rehome a refugee. She said that Disclosure and Barring Ser- vice checks could take several weeks. ""We are not quite sure how this new system is going to work,"" she said. Six refugees have already been matched with residents on the privately-owned island of Tresco, the second biggest of the Isles of Scilly in Cornwall. The island has a permanent population of 130 people, of whom about a third are foreign nationals. Yulia Rylska, 24, from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, is among those who will catch a helicopter to make the 24-mile journey from Penzance to Tresco next week. She and five other Ukrainian women will be housed on the island until the war in their home country is over. They had never heard of Tresco until a few days ago. Last night she said that she was still ""very confused"" given the turmoil but was ""looking forward to [coming] to Tresco"".

After spending more than 20 hours in a cramped train from Lviv, 43 miles away, with her nine-year-old grandson Sebastian and the family's cat and dog, she had made it to the safety of Poland. It would not be long before Sebastian was reunited with his parents, already in the country. Yet Olga was haunted by thoughts of those she had left in the path of the Russian offensive, including her son and Sebastian's uncle, who had been conscripted. ""My son and his wife have to stay behind,"" she said. ""He has to - and wants to - fight for Ukraine. It's hard."" Over the weekend the number of Ukrainians fleeing more than trebled to at least 386,000. More than 115,000 crossed into Poland, 70,000 into Moldova, 62,000 into Hungary and 41,000 into Romania. Another 26,000 were registered by the Slovakian authorities. The prospect of fighting, with Russian forces attacking civilian targets, has raised concerns that up to 5 million of the country's 44 million people could be forced out. Poland, which already has a population of about a million Ukrainians and has solicited migrant labour from Ukraine in the past, is expecting up to 1.5 million refugees. Many border checkpoints have been overwhelmed by the volume of people attempting to escape, with tailbacks of more than 12 miles at Ukraine's frontier with Moldova and queues lasting longer than 24 hours at other crossings. Some refugees, including children, spent a freezing night without food or medical aid on the Ukrainian side of the border after a computer failure halted the processing of departures. Jacob and Jessie Boekmann, doctors from the United States, left Kyiv with their two-day-old baby, Vivian, shortly after the first missiles struck. After getting stuck in traffic for seven hours at the Polish border they abandoned their car and walked the final eight miles. ""If we had stayed in the car, I think it would have taken us days or weeks to get across,"" Jessie Boekmann said. In what she described as the ""complete chaos"" on the border, the couple were separated because the Ukrainian authorities refused to let any men aged between 18 and 60 leave. It took ten hours and an intervention from the US embassy before her husband could join his family at their Polish hotel. While many Ukrainians escaping the war will stay with friends and family already in neighbouring countries, thousands are in limbo, waiting to learn where they can continue their lives until it is safe to go home, if it ever is. Przemysl's old railway station, an ornate relic of the Habsburg empire, has been converted into a makeshift refugee centre, its grand restaurant now a soup kitchen. Roksana, 51, had just arrived after catching one of the last trains out of Kyiv. She wept when she thought about her daughter in the western city of Rivne, which has come under Russian missile fire, and her brother, who is helping to defend Kyiv. ""It's hard, very hard,"" Roksana said. ""My heart is broken. I want to tell Putin to give back our peace to us. I want to live and work for my daughter, for my children. I am expecting grandchildren. I want to live just like any other ordinary person. I want children to go to schools, get married, study."" Around the station soldiers, police and border guards hand out food and water and for those moving on, the Polish government is allowing Ukrainians free travel on its rail network. Many ordinary people, including some of the million or so Ukrainian citizens already living in Poland, have come to help. One is Pawel, 33, who drove with friends from Szczecin near the Baltic and is offering to take displaced compatriots to their next destination. ""When the war started, I just went into shock and I couldn't do anything, I couldn't even work,"" he said. ""So the next day I just decided to come here because I just want to help our citizens."" Some of those fleeing Ukraine have found it hard to make the journey because of difficulty getting permission to board the trains even with tickets. Romeo, 29, a Nigerian student at Kyiv International University, claimed white Ukrainians were given priority. Ukraine's neighbours have mobilised in a humanitarian response to the crisis. Tens of thousands of people queued at sites across Poland, including Legia Warsaw's stadium, to donate blood, while other Poles donated hundreds of tonnes of food or made space in their homes for refugees. Twenty Latvian drivers volunteered to make a 1,300- mile round trip to Poland to bring refugees to the Baltic coast. Germany has offered free railway tickets to Ukrainians crossing Poland. The Czech Republic sent two trains to collect about 1,400 refugees and said there was ""no ceiling"" on the number of Ukrainians it was prepared to take.

The task now will be to match the British offers of support with Ukrainians who want to come to the UK. The sheer scale of interest means there may be an oversupply of hosts in this initial phase. The government is also responsible for resettling the Afghans evacuated from Kabul airport last August. The Afghan Warm Welcome scheme has now stalled, with many people still in temporary hotels. By simply asking those who register for the Ukraine scheme if they are also interested in hosting other groups, the government could speed up its efforts to offer a warm welcome to Afghans too. Sunder Katwala, director, British Future; David Goodhart, head, Demography, Immigration and Integration Unit, Policy Exchange; Luke Tryl, UK director, More in Common Sir, Your leading article (""Refugees Welcome"", Mar 15) was much too kind to the government. Surely the open-hearted welcome to Ukrainian refugees by the British people puts to shame the bureaucratic bungling by Priti Patel and her colleagues.

The country is generous: it's the government that is mean and petty. Gareth Williams Rockhampton, Glos Sir, I oppose the £350 a month that will be paid to British households to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. This payment may attract the attention of unscrupulous landlords and lead to scams experienced previously with government-funded schemes such as furlough payments. The £350 should be a charitable gesture to support the desperate needs of Ukrainian refugees in a time of unprecedented crisis. I would far rather the money were spent implementing a robust safeguarding policy to ensure the safety of Ukrainian women and children fleeing a war zone and on providing them with funding for the best possible care and support that this country can offer. Helen Hanson Chester Sir, Angela Thomsett (letter, Mar 14) suggests that those fortunate enough to own second homes and Airbnbs should offer them to refugees. She may be surprised to know that many owners have already done so. However, as several of my friends have found, if the accommodation offered is not in large towns or cities it will not be taken up. The guests are allowed to choose who and where their hosts will be and most opt to be near city centres. As they will need to attend job and welfare interviews it is probably a wise choice.

First, the refusal to drop visa requirements was driven by Priti Patel, the home secretary, seeking to prioritise security concerns over the humanitarian situation, according to officials at the Home Office. ""Her focus is very much on the security of the UK. That is her ultimate viewpoint and therefore she's not looking at it from a humanitarian issue,"" one senior Home Office official said. This is driven by her political instincts but also the experience of the evacuation effort in Afghanistan, when concerns were raised over individuals being let into Britain despite being found to be on terrorist watchlists. Patel even rang her Irish counterpart to express concerns about their so-called open-door approach to admitting Ukrainian refugees, which has led to more than 2,000 being welcomed into the country, more than double the UK's response. The home secretary is concerned that Russian agents could use the route as a back door into Britain, given the common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The requirement to conduct biometric checks on every Ukrainian coming to the UK has placed a limit on the speed at which visas can be granted, and will do so for as long as the checks remain in place. Practical concerns about where the Ukrainian refugees will live have also helped to drive caution in Britain's response. Both the Home Office and Michael Gove's housing and communities department are terrified of the practical obstacles of having to find accommodation for tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees when they have failed to find homes for 12,000 Afghans seven months after the evacuation of Kabul. Finally, as the crisis deepens by the hour, the Home Office has misjudged both the sheer scale of the refugee crisis and the public mood in Britain. It has failed to move with the rapidly changing situation on the ground. Initially the Home Office said that its primary focus was on helping Ukraine's neighbouring countries to cope with an influx of refugees, insisting that the government in Kyiv did not want western states to encourage mass resettlement schemes for fear that Ukrainians would not return to rebuild their country after the war. But as the Russian bombardments became increasingly barbaric and inhumane, the initial exodus quickly escalated to become Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Britain's offer to Ukrainians has opened up by only a fraction. Ministers have been struck by the strength of anger from some Conservative MPs willing publicly to vent their anger at Britain's lack of generosity. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, repeatedly deflected blame for the refugee policy on to Patel when questioned by MPs on Monday. The following day Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, insisted ""I am not the home secretary"" when it was his turn to face MPs. Yesterday Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, piled on further pressure by admitting that ""lessons will be learnt"" by Britain's response to the crisis. Today The Times reveals that Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has also become increasingly frustrated with the low number of refugees being given sanctuary in the UK. If this does not increase rapidly in the days ahead, Patel's future will again become one of the main topics of discussion in Westminster.","Broadsheet",1,"2022-03",0,"Policy"

Scilt, Scotland's national centre for languages run by the University of Strathclyde, has published resources for pupils starting school in mid-August. Teachers and hosts have also been told to be vigilant for Ukrainian children who may be neglected because their parents are too distressed to care for them. Some teachers are trying to learn Ukrainian, a language rarely heard in Scottish schools previously. There were only 23 Ukrainian speakers in Scottish schools in 2010, the last time the Scottish government published a detailed breakdown. Eight of those were in Glasgow. After 2010, Ukrainian speakers were collated into the rare languages listed as ""other"". Fiona Normansell, a language teacher in South Ayrshire, has published a video on YouTube for Ukrainian refugees on what to expect when they start school in Scotland. The video is translated into Ukrainian using Immersive Reader, an app that translates Microsoft Word documents into foreign languages automatically. Teachers are encouraged to use this app and Microsoft Translator when teaching Ukrainian children, although Normansell acknowledged ""there may be some mistakes"" in her translation. Teachers are also encouraged to use pictures, gestures and sign language. About a third of Ukrainians speak Russian as their first language, particularly those from the eastern border regions. Many more speak Russian as an additional language, although books and broadcasts in Russian were withdrawn after the Maidan revolution in 2014 that replaced Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-backed president, with a more western-leaning government. Russian was one of the fastest-growing languages in Scottish schools before the Ukraine invasion in February and was among the top ten foreign languages last year. In 2010, 479 pupils spoke Russian as their first language, behind the littleknown Malayalam, which is spoken by 3 per cent of Indians. By 2021 Russian speakers had tripled to more than 1,400, on a par with Spanish. The next pupil census, published in March, will reveal the impact that sanctions have had on the number of Russian-speaking pupils in Scottish schools. The Scottish government has produced guidance for hosts of Ukrainian families to help them integrate. It states: ""A small number of people might benefit from crisis mental health input. People may need more specialist help if they have pre-existing mental health conditions, are so upset they cannot care for themselves or their children, feel like they want to hurt themselves or hurt others are not eating or attending to self-care and are expressing suicidal ideas or plans."" Teachers and hosts concerned about the psychological or mental health needs of a child, adult or family are recommended to seek professional advice. The guidance states that most refugees adapt and build resilience but warns that some may end up ""distressed, upset and not coping well"". It states: ""Distress in this situation is a normal reaction - in adults, distress might come across as anger, panic, sadness, crying and withdrawal."" Hosts are advised to be calm, patient and kind, to respect people's privacy, learn how to pronounce their names correctly and accept that their guests may not initially be able to express gratitude for taking them in. Hosts are advised not to pressurise Ukrainians to talk about their ordeal or judge them for their reactions or emotions. News bulletins about Ukraine should be switched off unless the family want to hear them.","Broadsheet",1,"2022-08",1,"Migration"

Despite sponsoring about 35,000 visas for refugees only 4,000 homes have been approved for them to live in. Of the 18,400 Ukrainian refugees who have already arrived with a visa, 6,050 are still living in hotels and cruise ships, according to official figures. During first minister's questions on Thursday Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""The first minister boasting about numbers will be cold comfort to those who have been living out of suitcases since February or are coming to the end of a placement with no idea what happens next. ""This isn't a new life, this is a new limbo. And the mobilisations in Russia, and pretend referendums, mean no chance of a quick return."" Nicola Sturgeon responded: ""It is important that we recognise Scotland is more than playing our part."" The Scottish government has chartered two cruise ships, including the MV Victoria in Leith, to temporarily house Ukrainian refugees. Government figures show that about 1,350 refugees were on the two vessels and a further 5,200 were living in hotel rooms. The minister in charge of refugees, Neil Gray, said: ""We are providing sanctuary to more displaced people per head of population than any other part of the UK."" On Thursday the Scottish government announced that it was making £50 million available through the Ukraine Longer Term Resettlement Fund for councils and landlords to refurbish properties for refugees.

Officials warned that refugees fleeing their homeland after Russia's invasion faced sleeping on camp beds unless drastic action was taken. The passenger vessel the MS Victoria will be docked in Leith, Edinburgh, to provide 739 rooms, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the 7,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Scotland. Two thirds of them applied under the super sponsor scheme, launched in March, after the Scottish government committed itself to accommodate at least 3,000 people. In a separate move, North Lanarkshire council said it would refurbish 200 unused council tower block properties, funded by £5 million from the Scottish government, to provide longer-term accommodation. The Wheatley Group, Scotland's largest social landlord, has pledged to make 300 homes available to councils to help displaced people from Ukraine. Although officially ""paused"" for three months, a document released by the Scottish government to justify the decision suggested longer-term issues. The paper stated it had been hoped that ""the crisis in Ukraine would prove temporary and that a peace agreement could swiftly be reached"". Scotland's temporary accommodation sector is at capacity, the document said, adding: ""If numbers continue at this level, local authorities may find themselves having to house displaced people, including families, in emergency contingency accommodation such as camp beds in community settings. Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the Scottish and Welsh first ministers, had said that there would be no cap on the schemes' numbers. Gary Gray of the volunteer group ScotHosts said: ""Placing families into accommodation that was due for demolition and an old cruise liner that was probably for scrap is in no way the proper and humane way to treat refugees."" He said he stepped back from having anything to do with the Scottish government's programme a month ago after becoming ""disgusted by the shoddy way that everyone in authority was handling it"" and predicting that the scheme would have to be paused. The Scottish government said that 21,256 visas had been issued naming a Scottish sponsor, which is more than 20 per cent of the UK total and the highest number per head of population across Britain and Northern Ireland. Neil Gray, Scottish minister with responsibility for the refugees, has asked Lord Harrington of Watford, the UK minister for refugees, if the British government would consider introducing its own super sponsor arrangements. Behind the story The press release outlining Nicola Sturgeon's plan to introduce a ""super sponsor"" scheme for Ukrainian refugees hammered home its intention in the accompanying note to Michael Gove, then UK housing secretary (Kieran Andrew writes). ""The letter makes clear that no cap will be set by Scotland and Wales on the numbers of refugees they will welcome,"" it said. Given the Scottish parliament has no powers over immigration, foreign affairs or defence, it is limited in what it can do. Finding homes for the displaced is one way it could help. Yes, the aims were laudable, but was the infrastructure in place? Housing families on a repurposed cruise ship and in tower blocks earmarked for demolition suggests not. It is true that the Scottish government originally banked on receiving 3,000 refugees and 7,000 have arrived but it was Sturgeon who said there was no limit on how many Scotland could welcome. Now, it seems, there is.","Broadsheet",1,"2022-07",1,"Policy"
