This influx has resulted in the Hungarians building a wall and kaleidoscopic changes of policy all round. The situation could destabilise Europe, including and especially the UK. We have difficulty in absorbing the migrants we have already got. But the underlying realities are clear. If the European Union in its present form were to collapse, it would be necessary to form some sort of organisation for Europe's collective defence. We would have to hope that we had learnt from past mistakes. Whether we like it or not, survival depends on cooperation.

Worried officials say they must either be working on the black market or have turned to crime because no registration means they get no benefits. Germany's Federal Criminal Police will present their concerns to Chancellor Angela Merkel today. They are expected to report that most migrant crime is committed by those from Balkan countries. Syrians, Iraqis and Afghanis ""barely feature in the statistics"", a spokesman said. The police have also completed an overview of the events in Cologne on New Year's Eve which saw bands of migrants, mostly from North Africa, sexually molest and rob hundreds of women around the main train station. The episode polarised society and has put Mrs Merkel under threat at next year's general election. Police said they found no evidence of organised crime and put the attacks down to ""cultural"" differences fuelled by alcohol. Meanwhile Greece yesterday temporarily halted the deportation of migrants to Turkey under a deal struck last month. More than 200 were shipped from the Greek islands to the Turkish town of Dikil on Monday while Syrian refugees were flown from Turkey to a camp in Friedland in central Germany. Despite protests at a migrant camp on Lesbos, deportations are expected to resume later this week.

Three boatloads of refugees who had sailed into Europe across the Aegean Sea were transported back the same way. They were returned under a controversial scheme thrashed out between the Turks and the EU to return hundreds of thousands of people who enter Europe from Turkey via Greece. In an exchange included in last month's deal between Ankara and Brussels, 32 Syrian refugees were flown to Germany from Istanbul. The authorities in all three countries involved said despite opposition to the deal the operations passed off smoothly. European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the operation was managed by border security body Frontex with the help of police and migration experts. He said: ""We didn't see unrest or riots. The operation was organised properly."" But in an indication of the diffi-culties facing the project 339 new migrants were picked up arriving in Greece - 50 per cent more than had been sent to Turkey in the preceding 24 hours. Helicopters The returnees were mostly Pakistanis and Afghans who were ferried from Lesbos and Chios to the Turkish town of Dikili. All the boats were accompanied by Turkish coastguard vessels and police helicopters. The Syrians were flown on two separate flights to Hanover, then moved on to Lower Saxony. Further resettlements are planned to Finland and the Netherlands. Under the Turkey-EU deal, Brussels handed the Ankara government £2.2billion in aid, including £500million from Britain. Critics have accused the Turks of using immigration to squeeze money out of Europe and of ""building up muscle"" to force its way into the EU. Human rights groups attacked the deal for sending displaced people back to war-torn regions and not being able to guarantee their safety en route. Gauri van Gulik, of Amnesty International, who was overseeing the Lesbos operation yesterday said Turkey was not safe for the migrants.

The capital Budapest was on the brink of civil disorder as refugees protested at the closure of international Keleti station - following clashes between migrants earlier in the day. The station was later reopened to other passengers sparking a protest by around 1,000 people, mostly fleeing war-torn Syria, and travelling to Munich or Vienna. Around 100 police formed a blockade as people tried to storm on to trains to the West. The chaos came as the Europe's refugee crisis deepened last night. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the UK should offer refugee status to ""a few thousand people"" from Syria but cannot be an open door. He said: ""The problem we've got is, potentially, we've opened the door to an exodus of biblical proportions, meaning millions and millions of people. ""We've lost sight of what is a genuine refugee. How many millions does Europe want to take? That really is the question."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem we have now is if you look at the definition of the EU's asylum policy, it includes anybody who comes from a war-torn country - and it even includes people leaving extreme poverty. ""The EU has sent the message that anybody who comes across the Mediterranean or Turkey - once they have set foot in an EU country they will be accepted. That's a message to hundreds of thousands of people."" Hungary has become the flashpoint of the European migrant crisis as the primary gateway to the EU through the Balkans. After the clashes yesterday, officials announced there would be no trains leaving for Austria or Germany until further notice. Last night, Hungary's defence ministry said up to 3,500 soldiers could be sent to the southern border with Serbia to help with the refugee crisis.

Turkey's EU minister Volkan Bozkir said yesterday talks on giving his countrymen visa-free travel in Europe's passport-free Schengen zone as soon as next month had reached stalemate. He said: ""I am not very optimistic about the outcome of the talks we held in Brussels today. ""It's essential that the European Commission finds a new formula."" The warning came after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the EU of setting new hurdles for his country. One of 72 conditions Brussels has set is that Turkey narrows its definition of terrorism. Critics claim Ankara is using terror laws to stifle legitimate dissent and press freedom. But the government argued that it needs the powers to fight Kurdish and Islamic State attacks. Turkey said yesterday that eight of its soldiers and 22 militants had been killed in clashes in the past two days in the Kurddominated south-east. Mr Erdogan has ruled out any return to talks with the separatists PKK and has vowed to crush the group seeking autonomy. Tension with the EU now threatens to scupper the deal under which Europe offers Turkey visa-free travel to Schengen countries - which do not include Britain - and cash to help with the thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled over its border. Turkey is also being offered faster talks on joining the EU. The package is in return for Turkey taking back those who arrive on the Greek islands. For every refugee returned to Turkey, the EU will resettle a Syrian already in Turkey, as part of efforts to deter refugees risking their lives crossing the sea. EU border agency Frontex said yesterday that the numbers arriving in Greece dropped 90 per cent last month compared with March, seen as a sign that the deal with Turkey was working. About 2,700 people arrived in Greece from Turkey last month, mostly from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.

106,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,10/9/2015,585 words,BY DAILY MAIL COMMENT,JUNCKER'S EU VISION IS ANOTHER OWN GOAL,"CAMPAIGNERS for Britain's exit from the EU will be quietly pleased after yesterday's vainglorious State of the Union' address, in which Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker outlined his vision of Europe's future. Hundreds of thousands of passports to be handed out, allowing economic migrants into Britain… compulsory quotas, forcing member states to accept 160,000 refugees, with more to follow… Internal borders to be kept open… asylum-seekers given the right to work while they are processed… an end to the requirement that migrants are vetted where they first land… full mobility of labour, with centrally-agreed pay rules… Thankfully, Britain retains an opt-out from quotas. But while we're signed up to the EU's free movement rules, we'll remain at the mercy of our partners if they grant citizenship to all-comers. And how much longer could we resist the pressure to hand Brussels full control of our migration and asylum policy (and much else besides), if David Cameron fails to secure agreement to radical reform of our membership terms? Indeed, every word of Mr Juncker's speech, with his demands for ever-closer union, might have been calculated to boost the Better Off Out brigade, in a Britain whose public services are under acute strain after 15 years of the most dramatic mass immigration in our history. It's very different for Germany. With a population forecast to shrink by 10.5million before 2060, leaving fewer working age Germans than pensioners, it is desperate to expand its labour force. Doesn't this explain Angela Merkel's readiness to accept migrants - rather than pure compassion, as she pretends? By contrast, Brussels predicts Britain's population will balloon by 16million over the same period. No wonder nearly half of Britons say the Government plans to take too many Syrian refugees. Yet still Mr Juncker hectors us to throw open our doors to more. This is despite the fact that we contribute far more than any other EU country to the humane and pragmatic policy of looking after refugees in countries bordering their homeland. Why, voters may ask, should a nation like ours be preached at and dictated to by the former prime minister of the tiny, corrupt Grand Duchy of Luxembourg? First the farce of the single currency. Now the tragedy of the refugee crisis. Who can blame the Brexit campaigners if they're starting to believe that events are conspiring to support them? Backing for the brave THROWING powerful weight behind the Mail's Betrayal of the Brave campaign, the Defence Select Committee condemns the wholly unacceptable' treatment of our troops' Afghan interpreters who have been abandoned to the Taliban. The cross-party MPs tell ministers that it's not only a matter of honour to offer asylum to these courageous men and their families. It is also vital to ensure our soldiers receive similar help in future. With some interpreters already killed, and the rest in daily danger, how much longer can Defence Minister Penny Mordaunt keep insisting that there is no major problem'?

Asylum applications shot up from 22,640 in 2010 to 31,260 last year - a rise of 38 per cent. In total Britain received 137,660 claims over the period - although not all succeeded. The refugee agency UNHCR released the figures as it announced that the number of people seeking asylum in developed countries has hit a 22-year peak. An estimated 866,000 lodged claims last year - a 45 per cent rise in a year - driven by the spiralling conflicts in Syria and Iraq and the highest point since the start of the war in Bosnia. Of the 44 developed nations, Germany last year received the most asylum applications at 173,000 - 30 per cent of the EU total. It was followed by the US (121,160), Turkey (87,820), Sweden (75,090) and Italy (63,360). Britain was eighth on the list. The country took in 2,400 Syrian refugees last year, with another 260 referred by the UNHCR.

151,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,13/9/2015,1722 words,BY MICHAEL POWELL AND ZIA WEISE,AYLAN AND FATHER: THEIR REAL STORY,"The haunting image of little Aylan Kurdi's body lying face down in the sand of a Turkish tourist beach seared itself in the world's collective conscience and sparked an outpouring of sympathy for the refugees fleeing the bloodbath of war-torn Syria. The three-year-old's unwitting legacy in the ten days since his drowning in the Aegean has been an unprecedented mass movement of tens of thousands of migrants towards Europe and joyful scenes of them being warmly welcomed to the promised land'. But as the emotion subsides, questions have begun to emerge not only about the status of many of the new arrivals in Europe but of the Kurdi family themselves. Are these refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution, unable or fearful of returning to their homeland, or simply economic migrants in search of a better life? Some reports yesterday went further - accusing Aylan's 40-year-old father Abdullah of being one of the people traffickers, a claim he has vehemently denied. The Mail on Sunday has retraced the steps of the Kurdi family from their origins in Syria to their tragic attempted journey to the Greek island of Kos in a 16ft boat, during which Aylan, his five-year-old brother Galip and his mother Rehan died. We have spoken to the people who met them along the way and built up a remarkable picture of their situation while living in Turkey. It is a moving story of hardship and deprivation and of course there is no happy conclusion. But once the family settled in Turkey nearly a year ago, could the Kurdis still truly be classed as refugees in the same plight as those sheltering in a dusty tented city? And more importantly, could Mr Kurdi's decision to risk all their lives in a hazardous sea crossing - something he once vowed never to do - ever be justified? The first immense upheaval for the Kurdi family came in 2011, when they were bombed out of their home in the Syrian capital, Damascus. After allegedly being tortured by the regime, Mr Kurdi fled 300 miles north-west with his wife and eldest son to their Kurdish home town of Kobane, where Aylan was born the following year. But life in the Euphrates valley town near the Turkish border was hard and, struggling to ply his trade as a barber, in the winter of 2012 Abdullah made the life-altering decision to travel alone to Istanbul, more than 800 miles away, where he started working in a sweatshop producing Islamic gowns. His job was to check the garments being produced by the dozen women using sewing machines to produce black robes in a humid haze for ten hours a day. Like many Syrian refugees in Turkey, Mr Kurdi was effectively stateless with neither passport nor birth certificate and so denied a work permit. That defined his life in near-Dickensian terms and left him working for a pittance on the black market, earning only £5.50 a day. Former colleagues said he told them he would never consider using people smugglers to reach Europe and beyond. We were talking about it and he said, “I will never risk my family's life doing that, it's too dangerous”,' said one, who declined to be named. He wanted to go to Canada because his sister lives there. He was always preparing himself in his head to go to Canada and always rejected the idea of going by sea. He wanted to get his papers legally.' The manager of the basement factory, a Turkish Kurd, said Mr Kurdi initially spent three nights living in a hostel with other Syrians which cost him double his daily pay. He was losing money so I said to him you can stay with me and some of the other workers. Some nights he spent sleeping on the floor of the factory in his work clothes. He would sleep in the kitchen and toilet area and sometimes in the corner in the office here.' After a few months, Mr Kurdi returned to Kobane - a gruelling 20-hour bus journey - to bring his wife and children across the porous border to Istanbul and for three days they joined him sleeping on the floor of the factory's fetid toilet before securing a tiny flat by using the name of his boss on the tenancy agreement. BUT scraping together the £80 monthly rent while feeding his family was impossible on his meagre wages, and after four months, he reluctantly sent Rehan and the children back to Kobane. For a further 18 months, he toiled alone in Istanbul, leaving the rag trade in September 2013 to tout for work on construction sites, earning about £8 per day. He was always homeless and slept on a succession of sofas at friend's houses. Little by little, he was able to save a small amount of money. A former colleague at the factory said: He was really missing his family. He would be away from them for long stretches. He wanted to work hard but he also wanted to see his children. They were his world.' The family was reunited again in October last year in Kobane - just as the Syrian civil war erupted in the city, with Islamic State terrorists laying siege to the town in fierce battles with Kurdish militia. Mr Kurdi rescued his wife and children from the war zone and once again took them to Istanbul where, in November, he managed to use his savings to put down a £50 deposit to rent a small house in the district of Eyup. The Kurdis' fortunes finally began to change for the better. The prefab home - which The Mail on Sunday has found - was far from luxurious but for the first time in Aylan's short life he was permanently living with his father. The family slept in one room which had one double bed and two old tatty sofas. Although the home had a large 32in television, there was no shower or bath and the toilet was a hole in the ground. They cooked on a single-hob camping stove. Mr Kurdi's sister Fatima was paying the £100-a-month rent by sending money from Canada and Turkish neighbours of the family say they appeared to be happy and comfortable' in their new home. Most days the boys would wake up their father, begging him to play with them on their tricycle and other sit-on toys that he'd saved up to buy. Neighbours say they would run up to him shouting Daddy' and grab his legs when he returned home shattered from a long day's labour. At weekends, Mr Kurdi would join Istanbul's tourists and take his boys on the ferry across the majestic Bosphorus strait to the Asian side of Istanbul for a treat. All the while, he was saving for the dream move to Canada. They were having a good life here in Turkey, I don't know why they left,' their landlady Mushreff Terregy, 66, said. It is a question which has haunted all who knew the Kurdis. One significant factor may well have been the difficulties which would have lain ahead for Aylan and his brother in getting access to education or health care in Turkey, where their prospects as both Syrian refugees and Kurds were doubly blighted. And with no job security, it's not difficult to see why Mr Kurdi would seek to emigrate. Sitting on a stall in the front garden in the same spot where Abdullah was pictured proudly holding both his son's hands in July, Ms Terregy added: They were good tenants and a very loving family. She was a wonderful woman and did a very good job looking after the boys. I loved them so much. They were very good people. If I knew they were leaving to get a boat to Greece, I would never have let them go. It is too dangerous. When they moved out on August 6, they said they were going back to Kobane to tend to olive trees they own there. I had no idea they were going to Bodrum.' Zafer Bektars, a Turkish neighbour who said he helped fix the Kurdi family's television earlier this year, said: I am angry and sad. Angry with him because of what he did and the risk he took and sad because those children were very little. They did not have to leave.' But Mr Kurdi, speaking from Kobane, where he returned to bury his family said: The house was in a worse situation than my previous house back home. It wasn't good enough to live in but I had no other option. I couldn't handle working in Turkey because it was too hard to get by. I love Turkey as a system and Istanbul as a city, but I couldn't afford it. If I wanted to take my children on the ferry trip, which they loved, I was worrying about the money that I'd spend.' What made budgeting even harder was that Mr Kurdi had to spent around £1.50 each day buying special ointment to treat his children's eczema, he said. Mr Kurdi claimed he decided to take the dramatic step of using people smugglers after an application to migrate to Canada was rejected in June. My main concern every day was to provide our daily food by finding work, that if I could find a job then we could eat. My sister helped me and wanted to take me and my brother Mohammad and his family to Canada. But the Canadian government rejected our request. So we decided to take the sea way. We were living on a beautiful hope. All my life was devoted for these little children and wife and now it's gone. It's over.' A spokesman for the Canadian government denied ever receiving an application for residency from Abdullah Kurdi. Mr Kurdi last night denied claims he was a people smuggler and was driving the boat which capsized off the coast of Bodrum. Iraqi mother Zainab Abbas, 32, whose own two children also drowned, said Mr Kurdi was taking a cut of the money her family had paid for the perilous crossing. He said: I don't know why she is saying this. Why would a people smuggler take his family on the same boat? Why would I be living in such a poor house in Istanbul if I was earning lots of money as a smuggler?' Four men have been charged in connection with the deaths but Mr Kurdi has not faced any police action. As the exodus from Syria goes on, the Kurdis have been swiftly replaced as tenants by another couple from the country who fled Aleppo with their seven-year-old son. Aylan and Galip's toys remain eerily on display in the house. The mother, who asked not to be named, said: When we came here Aylan's tricycle and his happy birthday decoration was still here. We hadn't got round to moving them and now we are not going to remove them in memory of them.'

220,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,29/7/2017,1757 words,NA,OVERWHELMED. ABANDONED,"THE EU. IS ITALY ABOUT TO TRIGGER THE MIGRANT NUCLEAR OPTION? BY SUE REID ON THE ITALIAN /AUSTRIAN BORDER On a farm track outside the huge migrants' camp hidden away among cornfields near Venice, a young Nigerian is telling me of his hopes for a new life. With pink varnish on his nails and a paisley bandana on his head, he does a Michael Jackson-style shimmy under the searing July sun. Osarume Ehiz, 16, has lived in the camp with 1,000 other male migrants, many of them fellow Nigerians, for 11 months. I'm a dancer,' he says, eyes sparkling and his feet moving fast in his white plastic sandals. But I can't make a career in Italy. I'm waiting for a special visa, so I can go anywhere in Europe. I hope the paperwork will come soon.' The special visa' he refers to is at the centre of a furious row that is dividing EU governments and escalating border tensions as the continent struggles to cope with the biggest migration crisis since World War II. Earlier this month, Italy, which because of its geographical position is bearing the brunt of a huge influx of migrants from Africa, threatened to disperse them by providing EU temporary visas to up to 200,000. The move would let thousands of migrants many of whom have made the treacherous and illegal journey by sea on flimsy boats from Libya spread across the rest of Europe. It follows growing anger in Italy that other EU nations have reneged on promises to help with the migrant crisis engulfing the country. Up to 95,000 people have arrived on Italian shores so far this year. Last weekend alone, several thousand were rescued and brought into port by naval vessels and charity boats. Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni's contentious plan would allow visa holders to travel freely into Austria and beyond. Austria has retaliated by threatening to close its key Alpine border with Italy, at the Brenner Pass, and enforce it with tanks and troops. Its foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, has said that being saved in the Mediterranean cannot be connected with a ticket to Central Europe'. To say emotions are running high between the two countries is an understatement, but the stand-off reflects hardening public opinion across the EU about levels of migration and the pathetic response from politicians to what is, arguably, the greatest issue of our times. Under the EU's migrant quota scheme, all member countries are meant to accept a mandatory share of migrants whose landing point is Italy. But the growing realisation, as confirmed by the UN, that most of the current influx of migrants are no longer Syrian refugees fleeing civil war or Islamic State horror, but economic desperados from countries including Bangladesh, Guinea as well as Nigeria, is having an impact. Even the European Commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, recently admitted that most migrants are not escaping persecution but simply searching for a better life. Poland and Hungary are jibbing at taking in migrants (citing cultural difficulties in view of the fact that many are Muslim and both countries have strong Christian traditions), while the Czech Republic is dragging its feet, too. So in this febrile atmosphere, Italy's border with Austria has become a potential flashpoint. And, as I witnessed this week, few migrants seem to be in need of special visas as they cross with apparent ease from one country desperate to be rid of them to another which is no more welcoming. Italy is the major recipient of migrants and refugees on the Central Mediterranean Route from Libya. It now takes in far more than Greece, where the numbers arriving have fallen thanks to a deal negotiated with Turkey last year at a cost of several billion euros to the EU. (Turkey agreed to take back those migrants who had travelled from the Middle East and elsewhere, via Turkey, and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, but who did not qualify for asylum in the EU.) Increasingly, migrant holding camps, which have been set up all over Italy, are close to overflowing. The young Nigerian I met this week, Osarume Ehiz, who gets 75 a month from the Italian government if he stays in the camp, says conditions are dreadful. I live in a room with ten others in bunk beds,' he complains. There are mosquitos, the food is uneatable and we get no education. Italy is a bad country. The clothes they give us are unusable, so I buy mine from the market stalls.' Every day, like other migrants at his camp, a former military base in Bagnoli di Sopri, he uses a charity bike to cycle around the countryside, simply for something to do. The Italians in the villages don't say “hello” to us. They are not rude, but avoid our eyes. I think it is because we are black,' he adds. Four miles away at another camp housing 2,000 migrants in the village of Conetta, it is much the same story. There, the 190 locals feel overwhelmed. Some have got fed up and, at one stage, put up protest messages scrawled on sheets in the village square. One said simply: Repatriate the migrants.' The local mayor Albero Panfilio said it was wrong to squash human beings together with no hope for the future. I call the camp a human warehouse. The migrants arrive, the authorities don't know where to put them, so they dump them here. They are treated like garbage.' Certainly, the Italian public is losing patience. In an appalling but telling scenario in January, a migrant drowned in the Grand Canal in Venice as passers-by watched but did little to help. There were even ugly shouts of Go home' and Let him die'. Patel Sabelly, a Gambian in his 20s, had jumped to his death from a bridge after reaching Italy by boat from Libya and being refused asylum. Although the Mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, in a gesture of respect, paid for the man's funeral out of his own pocket, his statement at the time was in tune with public attitudes and officials' frustration. We can't continue to nurture the hopes of half the world of coming to Italy,' he said. It is impossible for our country to continue managing such a large-scale phenomenon in the way it has done so far.' Meanwhile, Austria is still reeling from the impact of the 2015 migrant influx when Angela Merkel controversially opened Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. Of the million or so heading for Germany, 90,000 decided to stay in Austria as they passed through. In this fiercely nationalistic nation, politicians and the people were soon saying enough is enough'. The burka has been banned by Austria, compulsory German lessons introduced for migrants, and after a spate of attacks across the EU on women in public places, signs have gone up in Arabic at a market town near Vienna, telling male migrants not to touch female bathers or follow them into swimming pool changing rooms. This week, I observed migrants on their way from those camps in Bagnoli di Sopri and Conetta, near Venice, up to the town of Brenner marking the border with Austria. I followed them to Innsbruck, a major city and popular ski resort which hosted the 1976 Winter Olympics. It was clear this is a well-used route for migrants, many of whom refuse to stay in the Italian camps more than 24 hours, walking out after a meal and a shower. They are anxious to avoid being fingerprinted and escape being tangled up in the Italian asylum system, preferring to take their chances in northern Europe. Their journey often begins in the pretty Italian town of Bolzano, about 50 miles south of Brenner, where trains go to Innsbruck. Outside the railway station, I met Musa, 23, from Guinea, who arrived by boat from Libya seven months ago. I am sad and tired,' he tells me. Europe is not what I hoped for. I sleep on the streets and now I am going to Austria.' No Italian official intervened as he bought a ticket for Innsbruck and boarded a train. When trains arrive at Brenner, there appear to be no onboard checks. Indeed, on Wednesday and Thursday this week, the only visible security at the border was an Italian army truck. Its three occupants occasionally got out to stretch their legs and at one stage could be seen pointing the way to migrants who preferred to simply walk into Austria. Other migrants sat on benches outside the station, waiting for trains, eating hot dogs and sending messages on their phones. One, a 23-year-old from the Ivory Coast, told me he expected to be in Innsbruck by nightfall. It is easy,' he said laughing. No one likes to stay in Italy when there are opportunities further north in Austria, Sweden, Germany and Britain.' Inside Brenner station, another trio of Italian soldiers walked along the platform as an Innsbruck-bound train rolled in. Migrants boarded under their noses and were soon leaving Italy. At Innsbruck's main station, I saw migrants newly arrived from Italy being greeted by a Somalian called Hussein, 30, who has lived in Austria for five years. They come in all the time, every day and at all times of the day,' he told me. I take them to the mosque across the road. They often need clothes, food and help. The Italians turn a blind eye. They see the migrants on the platform back at the Brenner Pass and say “go now” when the train for Austria comes. It's not only the trains, there are cars and trucks, too. If a migrant has money to give a trafficker, then it is easy as there are no regular road checks into Austria either.' If the Italian government's threat of special visas becomes a reality, then this constant stream of migrants towards the Austrian border may well become a deluge. Adding to the sense of crisis, this week the European Court of Justice endorsed an important EU law that requires migrants to seek asylum in the first EU country they reach, overruling arguments that it is not equipped to deal with the huge numbers of migrants arriving in Italy. So might this be the tipping point for the Italian government? Only time will tell, but Mattia Toaldo, senior analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, fears the worst. He recently warned that Italy's threat to assist the onward journey of migrants with temporary EU visas was a nuclear option'. Italians had lost all hope of getting help from the EU,' he said, and might yet tell Brussels: If you won't make migration a common challenge [for all the member nations], then we will.' This week, looking at dispirited, overstretched Italy struggling to cope, it's difficult not to have sympathy if that is the incendiary path this nation chooses to take with awesome consequences for its neighbours and beyond.

The star, who is a special envoy for UN refugee agency UNHCR, said delays over a peace deal were tragic and shameful'. Miss Jolie's Hollywood grin and movie premiere-ready figure looked decidedly out of place in a camp which thousands of Syrian refugees are forced to call home. The actress, 40, said: We need governments around the world to show leadership: to analyse the situation and understand exactly what their country can do.' She added that while much of the refugee debate was focused on Europe, the greatest pressure is still being felt in the Middle East and North Africa'. Some 80 per cent of the camp's inhabitants are in debt, she said. The one million registered refugees in Lebanon represent a quarter of the country's population. © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2016-03,1,Aid

The Government said the vulnerable migrants have already been resettled. Their arrival marks the first step to fulfilling David Cameron's promise to give sanctuary to desperate people forced from their homeland by the civil war between President Assad and Islamic State. Ministers have not provided details of the exact number who landed in the UK or where they have been sent, but the first wave of people is understood to be fewer than 100. The Syrians, who had fled from the war-torn country to poverty-stricken camps in neighbouring countries, will receive housing, access to medical care and education, and permission to work. Those being resettled have been selected by the United Nations on the basis of need. Mr Cameron has said the UK would give shelter to the most needy, including children, the elderly and disabled, women who had been raped and men who had been tortured. The UK will resettle the 20,000 refugees by 2020 by expanding the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement scheme. Until this month, the scheme had taken in 216 Syrians on top of about 5,000 who had been granted asylum. Under the programme, the refugees will be granted five years' humanitarian protection in Britain. After that they can apply to settle permanently in the UK. Ministers had been under pressure to act as Europe struggled to deal with a huge influx of refugees, many fleeing war and poverty in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Hundreds of people volunteered to put up refugees in spare rooms, but the Government declined, saying the offer, while heart-warming', was a short-term solution to a long-term problem'. © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2015-09,1,Aid
196,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,4/9/2015,1254 words,BY EMINE SINMAZ IN TURKEY AND VANESSA ALLEN IN LONDON,THEY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS,"THE heartbreaking images of their bodies symbolise the horror of the refugee crisis. But, for their griefstricken father, the deaths of Aylan and Galip Kurdi are a personal tragedy. Sobbing uncontrollably, Abdullah Kurdi yesterday recalled his terror when a flimsy and overcrowded dinghy capsized and his wife and children vanished beneath the Mediterranean waves. His sons, who were just five and three, slipped from his grasp in pitch-black waters off Bodrum in Turkey. With the night air pierced by the screams of his fellow Syrian refugees he tried in vain to save wife Rehan. I was holding her, but my children slipped through my hands,' he said. We tried to cling to the boat, but it was deflating. It was dark and everyone was screaming. I could not hear the voices of my children and my wife.' Over the following three hellish hours in the water, Mr Kurdi battled for survival, while frantically searching for his sons and his wife, who had also been pulled from his reach. He found one child but it was too late - the boy had drowned. My first son died from the high waves,' he said. I was obliged to leave him to save the other one. I tried to swim to the beach by following the lights. I looked for my wife and child on the beach but couldn't find them. I thought they had got scared and had run away and I went back to Bodrum. When they did not come to our meeting point I went to the hospital and learned the bitter truth.' The barber had paid people smugglers £2,900 over the course of three attempts to reach Greece from a refugee camp in Turkey. But he has told friends he wished he had also drowned to be spared a lifetime of self-recrimination over the family's desperate gamble for a better life. Pictures of Aylan and Galip have been shared by social networkers around the world, prompting calls for politicians to do more for fleeing Syrians. Aid agencies have been inundated with donations and offers of help. They have even taken calls from families offering to take desperate refugees into their homes. Mr Kurdi told the Daily Mail: I wanted a better life for them, that's why I left. I just hope that this photo of my son changes everything. We want the world's attention on us, so that they can prevent the same from happening to others. Let these be the last things that happened to us here, in the country where we took refuge to escape war in our homeland. We want the whole world to see this.' The Kurdi family had hoped to move to Canada but had not made a formal application to emigrate there. Mr Kurdi's sister Tima, who lives in Vancouver, said an application for her other brother Mohammed had failed because he did not have formal refugee status. They didn't deserve to die,' she said of her nephews. They were going for a better life. It shouldn't have happened to them.' Family pictures of the boys on Facebook made an unbearably poignant contrast with the images of their bodies, washed on to the beach at Bodrum. Smiling and laughing, they were hand in hand with their father or cuddled up together with a soft toy. As he prepared to take his family's bodies back to Syria for burial, Mr Kurdi said he could not face trying to build a life in Europe without them. Instead the ethnic Kurd will return to his former home in the border town of Kobane, despite it being under constant threat from Islamic State extremists. All I want is to be with my children - they were the most beautiful children in the world,' he said. Is there anybody in the world for whom their child is not the most precious thing? They woke me every morning to play with me. Now everything is gone.' Mr Kurdi and his wife Rehan, 35, fled Damascus in 2012, first for Aleppo and then Kobane. Three-year-old Aylan had spent his entire life on the move as his family fleed from fighting in their homeland. Friends said they endured shelling in Kobane before leaving last year as IS forces were poised to seize the town. Mr Kurdi said he had worked as an odd-job man and sold the family's belongings in the streets in a bid to fund their dream of a new life in either Canada or Europe. But once in Turkey, the family hit a bureaucratic dead end because they were Kurds. They faced difficulties registering as refugees with the UN and could not gain refugee exit visas to leave Turkey legitimately. In desperation, they turned to the people smugglers. Coastguards intercepted their boat on their first attempt to reach the Greek island of Kos. The second time round the traffickers failed to show up at the rendezvous point. Mr Kurdi said a Turkish smuggler started the third voyage with him and other Syrians with whom he had obtained the boat. They had been at sea for only four minutes when the dinghy began taking on water. The captain saw that the waves were so high and as he tried to steer the boat we were hit immediately,' said Mr Kurdi. He panicked and dived into the sea and fled. I took over and started steering, but the waves were so high that the boat flipped immediately. I took my wife and my kids in my arms. Now all I want is to lie in a grave next to them.' Mr Kurdi broke down after seeing his sons' bodies in the morgue, running from the building and crying out My God, my God'. Three coffins were later loaded into a white ambulance to be flown to Istanbul and to the Syrian border. Funerals are due to be held in Kobane today. Residents in Bodrum said the discovery of bodies on the beach was a grim daily reality. At the city's state hospital, director Orhan Yuce said seven children were drowned on the night Aylan and Galip died. We see this every day. It breaks my heart,' he said. It's got so much worse this year. Hundreds of people. Every day. We have no idea of the real numbers - all we know is those who are washed up on our shores. It's terrible. All these lives must not be forgotten.' Save the Children said the images of Aylan and Galip had made a huge impact on public opinion. This image has put a human face on this tragedy that's been mired in statistics so far,' said Gemma Parkin, a spokesman for the charity. When you think about it in the context of it being your child perhaps, I think that's where the tide of public opinion is turning.' A barman told last night how he pulled the lifeless body of Aylan from the sea at Golden Beach, Bodrum. Adil Demirtas, 18, who works at the Woxxie hotel, says he saw the toddler's body with that of a another little girl, in pink trousers, when he arrived at work. He and a friend pulled the bodies out of the water on to the sand in horror before calling an ambulance. Mr Demirtas, who has worked at the hotel for three years, was preparing the bar for tourists when his friend shouted out pointing to something in the shallow water. He said: I ran toward it and saw them. I was so afraid. He helped me pull them out of the water.  They looked still alive, like they were sleeping, smiling a little. Their faces and arms and legs looked so new still. They couldn't have been in the water an hour. Their eyes were open. I closed them softly.' The teenage resort worker said he has been profoundly affected by the horrific discovery: I can't eat anything. I couldn't sleep last night. I kept thinking about the two children. I don't have children but my brother has two about the same age and I am very close to them. I will think about it for a long time I think.'  Mr Demirtas said he had swum out to rescue six or seven people after they had fallen in the water in the past few months.  The traffickers choose this stretch of coast because Kos is only a few miles away. © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2015-09,1,Conditions
232,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,27/6/2015,2238 words,NA,THE CATASTROPHE THAT WILL REALLY TEAR EUROPE APART,"SATURDAY ESSAY - FORGET THE GREEK CRISIS AND BRITAIN'S REFERENDUM. THE TIDAL WAVE OF MIGRANTS - AND THE ANARCHY IT'S PROVOKING - COULD BE THE BIGGEST THREAT OUR CONTINENT HAS FACED SINCE THE WAR BY MICHAEL BURLEIGH This was meant to be the week that Britain's relationship with Europe was to start changing. When David Cameron would begin his bid to persuade his 27 fellow EU leaders at a summit in Brussels to accept the reforms he has promised British voters. On Thursday night, he told fellow national leaders that they had to address widespread unease about the UK's membership of the EU'. He had carefully laid the groundwork with face-to-face meetings with each of them, and is demanding, among other things, an opt-out from the EU's principle of ever closer union', protection of the City's financial services and a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming benefits. Predictably, Europe's leaders gave him the brush-off. Not just because of their antipathy to what some have called the British Prime Minister's a la carte' approach to Europe, but because they have other things on their minds. The crush of current political events Greece's interminable debt crisis, Russia's serial provocations in and around Ukraine and a migration problem running wildly out of control meant Cameron's big moment was squeezed into a late-night session after pudding. Many of the leaders he was trying to persuade were, by this stage, exhausted by the endless chicanery of the Greeks and a bitter and hopelessly unresolved row over whether to disperse 60,000 migrants according to mandatory quotas for member states. In the end, Downing Street officials were forced to concede that Britain will not be able to secure changes to any EU treaties in time for the referendum in 2017. All the Prime Minister can get is a promissory note instead. It was a rebuff that serves only to highlight how small-beer and parochial our negotiations seem at a time when nobody not Cameron nor any other EU leader is prepared properly to acknowledge that Europe's most urgent problem is the relentless human tide heading our way from several points of the compass. Any talk of changing our welfare benefits system or dispersing thousands of migrants across Europe is simply fiddling at the edges. It will do nothing to avert a catastrophe that is not only causing the deaths of thousands of migrants, drowning at sea, but could splinter the Continent, fostering xenophobic nationalism, as immigration swamps individual countries. The appalling and anarchic scenes in Calais this week, where 350 stowaways were turfed off British-bound lorries in just four hours on one day, as British and French authorities traded insults about whose responsibility they were, will become commonplace unless firm action is taken. Besieged lorry drivers, forced to confront people armed with knives who clamber aboard their vehicles, say it can only be a matter of time before someone is killed. Yesterday, the Mail revealed that the Mediterranean boat crisis has now reached Britain, with police figures showing a 200 per cent increase in the number of migrants making it to our shores over the past 12 months. Bedfordshire Police who cover Toddington Services on the M1, 125 miles from Dover but where migrants are caught daily as they clamber out of the lorries they board in Calais say they caught an average of 23 suspected illegal immigrants each month and 67 in May. In just two days last week, they found 36 stowaways. The statistics are shocking. So far this year, more than 100,000 illegal migrants have successfully crossed the Mediterranean into southern Europe 48,000 to Greece and 54,000 to Italy. And 500,000 more are said to be waiting in Libya to chance their arms. And this does not include the increasing numbers entering the Continent overland from Turkey and Serbia into Hungary. The European border agency Frontex whose HQ, for political correctness reasons, is thousands of miles from the Mediterranean coast in Warsaw is completely overwhelmed. The inability of governments to get a grip on the problem is benefiting parties on the populist Right which exploit immigration. And it's not just Ukip's huge tally of votes at the last British General Election; recent elections in Denmark, where the Right-wing Danish People's Party won the biggest share of the vote in its 20-year history, and Finland, where the nationalist Finns Party is now part of the coalition government, are also cases in point. But before we address the question of what can be done about illegal migration, we have to understand how it happens and what is driving it. Certainly, there are huge numbers fleeing war zones such as Iraq, Syria and Somalia, and many of them have a legitimate case to claim asylum as their lives are truly menaced in their own country. In the case of Syrian refugees, although many have headed towards Europe, the vast majority have elected to stay in their own neighbourhood in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and the Kurdistan region, which are coping heroically with millions of refugees who want to return home when it is safe to do so. This truth should not be forgotten when Europe is being asked to receive migrants who are travelling thousands of miles from countries which are safe and benign in order to better themselves economically. While there are economic migrants from countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, many more are from Africa. With the help of cynical people-smugglers, some make it through Turkey into the Balkans by land a route used by about 40,000 people in 2012. This led to tensions between Austria and Hungary, each of whose governments insist the other country should take responsibility. The bulk take the route across the Mediterranean, travelling from west, central and east sub-Saharan Africa to the coast of Libya, which is the epicentre of the people-smuggling trade. In the days when Colonel Gaddafi despotically ruled the country, the smugglers were under his control. Indeed, he earned himself billions the Italian government under Gaddafi's friend Silvio Berlusconi happily stumped up just by threatening to allow migrants into Italy, thereby turning Europe black'. Now Gaddafi is gone, it is a smugglers' free-for-all. The migrants pass from the hands of African nomads into those of the Libyan boat-people who send them out to sea with rudimentary navigational instruction and a mobile phone, to which they text a number for the Italian coastguard after ten hours have elapsed. Local smuggling networks in Africa offer pay-as-you-go and full package options. The former involves a migrant travelling in stages, stopping often for a year to earn enough money for the next leg of the journey. The latter can cost anything up to $40,000 and involves entire families, including members already in Europe, making an investment in a single payment, on the promise that once successful, the migrant will send money back home from the El Dorado' of Europe. Smugglers also offer a credit option the most perilous which can lead to a migrant being in perpetual debt and forced to work in prostitution or slave labour in the black economy. So what can be done about this tide of humanity heading our way? One option mooted by politicians is to disrupt the smugglers' operations in the source countries. It sounds a good idea, but on a practical level the complicated payment methods for smugglers involving extended families means that deploying special forces and spies to close them all down is fanciful. There are simply too many people involved, and families conniving in the trade could hardly be considered criminals. Smuggling is also facilitated by the corruption and weakness of many of the states concerned, whose borders are often unpatrolled. And this is where EU governments can bring influence to bear: they can use their generous foreign aid budgets as a lever to make the migrants' home-states cooperate with our national interests. Last year, 48,000 refugees sought asylum in Europe from Eritrea in the Horn of Africa. Even 50 members of the national football team have absconded in recent years. They are fleeing a regime which uses indefinite military conscription as a disguised form of slavery. The EU has recently decided to give Eritrea 312 million to crack down on people-smuggling. But most African countries are not hell-holes like Eritrea. Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, not to mention Kenya and Uganda, all nevertheless produce economic migrants, even though there are plenty of places from Lagos to Nairobi where they could find work locally. Burkina Faso has 3,200km (almost 2,000 miles) of land borders with six neighbours. It has just 19 fixed border-posts and 300 frontier police earning $200 a month with no money for fuel or spare parts for their jeeps. Since a smuggler can earn $5,200 by packing 30 migrants into a bus for a single trip, he can easily afford small bribes that represent a fortune to a policeman. Europe should get tough with Burkina Faso. It should force the government to act by diverting aid towards a proper, well-equipped border force and threaten to cut off aid altogether unless the government cracks down on smugglers. It can be done. President Mahamadou Issoufou of Niger, which will have received 600 million of EU aid by 2020, recently introduced 30-year jail sentences for people-smugglers, and under new laws, owners of buses and trucks who collude in smuggling will lose them, too. Aid money should also be spent on sending European policemen to these countries in Africa to focus the minds of the local police on the problem. There should be a massive public information campaign in the migrants' home countries to help puncture delusions about life in Europe. This should highlight the deadly risks that illegal migrants take, going so far as to point out that many drown and their bodies end up being picked apart by crabs and fish at the bottom of the Mediterranean. If Europe was serious about this problem, it would also introduce draconian penalties for domestic employers of illegal migrant labour or those who cram dozens of them into tiny basements or garden extensions and sheds in areas such as suburban London. Above all, there should be a serious European debate about whether the 1951 UN Refugee Convention (designed to deal with displaced people inside Europe after World War II) should now apply to economic migrants from other continents. The entire process of repatriating failed asylum-seekers should be accelerated, only allowing them to appeal decisions once outside the EU area. That would diminish the opportunities for human rights lawyers and humanitarian organisations to prolong matters at public expense. Also, Europe should seriously explore the policy of the Australian government of processing its illegal migrants outside its borders. It rents detention centres in and off Papua New Guinea to which it immediately deports migrants picked up at sea heading for Australia. From there, the migrants make applications for asylum in a considered way. Although the global human rights industry, supported by liberal media organisations such as the BBC, euphemistically describe these centres concentration camps' because of riots caused by disgruntled migrants there, at least no migrant has drowned trying to reach Australia since they were introduced. It should be an EU priority to establish similar facilities in one of the North African states, such as Algeria or Morocco, where boat people intercepted by a European-wide naval task force can be deposited, and where their options are realistically explained and economic migrants are weeded out and flown home. It is time they learned that life in Europe can be tough, too (as it is in many countries), and that its population has had enough of a problem that is now completely out of control. Uncontrolled migra-tion impacts unfairly on benefits, education, housing and public transport in ways that destroy any notion of the contributory element that lies at the heart of European welfare states. As we have witnessed in various European countries, the anger this engenders quickly assumes political forms, with the rise of neo-Nazi parties. What on earth do Europe's leaders imagine is driving this angry populism, including that of established legal immigrants? The common fisheries policy? Sections of the liberal media insist on relentlessly depicting the individual tragic stories of illegal migrants, with the BBC correspondent Clive Myrie, for example, telling one passing migrant you've made it' as he disembarked from a rescue ship in the Mediterranean. In fact, illegal migration is an insidious problem that strips desperately poor countries of precisely the sort of enterprising young people who ought to remain there, while oppressing the poorest sections of our own societies with people who compete for diminishing resources. It also raises the questions of whether one can simply uproot people from entirely different cultural universes and expect them to thrive in societies that may subscribe to other values, with radically different expectations of their citizens. And unless David Cameron and the European Union start to take it seriously as opposed to tinkering around the edges its effect will shatter the EU in a manner that would make a Greek or British exit look like a mild disagreement at a vicar's tea party. © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2015-06,0,Policy
57,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,7/9/2015,714 words,NA,AID CASH TO FUND SYRIANS IN BRITAIN,"AT LAST, CHUNK OF VAST FOREIGN BUDGET IS DIVERTED TO HELP PAY HOUSING COSTS HERE BY JACK DOYLE POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT MILLIONS of pounds from the foreign aid budget will be spent in Britain to pay the costs of supporting Syrian migrants here, George Osborne said yesterday. The decision marks a major change in how the controversial budget will be used. Critics have long claimed that huge sums of aid cash are being squandered - especially as the Government's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid means the money available will keep rising as the economy thrives. However, Chancellor said part of the budget will now go to town halls to ease' the pressure on public services of the new arrivals instead of going into development projects abroad. It represents the first step in what he called a fundamental rethink' of aid which will see all additional spending - expected to total some £1billion by 2020 - diverted into responding to major crises. Mr Osborne said aid money should go to the big threats facing Britain'. It could mean vast tranches of aid money set aside to deal with emergencies as they arise, including natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis as well as civil war, famine and disease. It is hoped he decision to use cash from the ballooning £12billion aid budget to pay for new arrivals will calm public fears about even more migrants coming to the country at a time of spending cuts and record immigration levels. Mr Osborne said there would be an assessment of what our public services and our infrastructure can support'. The scheme will particularly focus on bringing in orphaned children who have fled the civil war, he said. The announcement came as: ? Cheering crowds welcomed migrants arriving in Germany on trains with toys and chocolate; ? The Pope called for Roman Catholics in Europe to shelter refugees fleeing death from war and hunger'; ? Greece sent troops to the island of Lesbos after new clashes between migrants, locals and police; ? A convoy of cars driven by German and Austrian activists crossed into Hungary to pick up migrants attempting to reach the West; ? Hungary relaxed restrictions on train services, and took several thousand people to the Austrian border by bus. Today David Cameron will give the House of Commons further details of the Government's response to the refugee crisis, amid expectations up to 10,000 Syrians could be brought to Britain from refugee camps. Officials dismissed reports the number could be as high as 15,000. A survey showed the public's lack of enthusiasm for thousands more coming in. The Mail on Sunday poll found nearly one in three people said Britain should not accept any Syrian migrants on top of existing asylum seekers. One in six said Britain should take less than 1,000. Britain is already comfortably the biggest European contributor of aid cash to the Syrian crisis. The extra £100million promised by Mr Cameron last week will bring the total to £1billion. Much has gone to refugee camps. Mr Osborne told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: The foreign aid budget … could help the local councils with things like housing costs. Understandably people here ask about the pressure on public services - we'll have extra money to help local authorities deal with that.' He added: In the short-term we're going to take more refugees, but not in a way that encourages them on to these dangerous boats. In the longer term, I think we need a fundamental rethink of our aid policy, so yes, we support reducing poverty but we also direct our additional aid spending to these failed states, to this refugee crisis, to the big threats facing Britain. So the question in the spending review is not just how does our aid budget help the rest of the world, but how does it help Britain's national interest.' Revelations about wasteful aid projects, corruption, donation to countries with their own aid budgets and even space programmes have increased public opposition to growing aid spending at a time of cuts at home. Officials said all the additional spending over the coming years will be ringfenced for use on global challenges' such as the Syrian refugee crisis.  That could means some £1billion diverted to responding to major international crises by the end of the decade. Comment - Page 16 © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2015-09,1,Aid
215,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,28/5/2016,1684 words,BY SUE REID,THE TRAGIC BUT BRUTAL TRUTH: THEY ARE NOT REAL REFUGEES,"WHATEVER David Cameron and his fellow European leaders tell us, the enormous one-way flow of migrants to the West is changing Europe irretrievably and forever. Twelve thousand migrants have been rescued from people-smugglers' boats off the coast of Libya and heading for Italy in the past week alone. And more - maybe a million more - who come from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia will soon be on their way there, too. For more than 15 years now, I have reported on the steady flow of migrants heading for Europe. In countries across the Continent, I have spoken to those who have travelled thousands of miles, and never ceased to be amazed by their resilience and determination to find a better life. I have witnessed fatal tragedies as migrants make their way across perilous seas, despair and disappointment as their hopes turn to ashes, and resentment and anger from Europeans who feel their own countries and cultures are threatened by this relentless tide of incomers. But this week, on the quayside of pretty Porto Empedocle in Sicily, I came across a scene that convinced me more than ever that the explosion in migration is completely out of control. I watched as 540 Syrians, Libyans and Moroccans came ashore from the Italian naval ship that had plucked them from the sea after the boat taking them to a new life across the Mediterranean capsized. Coming down the gangplank they waved at the waiting crowd of TV crews, international charity workers, UN officials, police and Red Cross doctors, as if they were celebrities on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival. The crowds cheered back, shouting bon giorno' (good morning) and clapping as the arrivals set foot on dry land. Such was the surreal carnival atmosphere that it was almost impossible to comprehend that hours earlier these smiling migrants had been involved in a life-or-death struggle. Or that they were in Italy only because they had paid smugglers, now growing rich in chaotic Libya, for a place on a flimsy wooden boat to illegally enter Europe where they were now being accepted with open arms. Crammed to the hilt, their boat sank after 240 of its passengers had already been taken off and ferried to safety on the Italian navy ship. The remaining 300 passengers had then panicked and rushed to one side of the vessel, tipping it over. Only the best efforts of the navy, who threw scores of red lifebelts and rafts into the water, saved all but a handful of them. The ship's captain, Francesco Lavezzo, took his turn in front of the cameras in Porto Empedocle. He said an uplifting memory for him was when a rescued migrant girl smiled with excitement as she was given a white teddy bear by his crew on board the ship. It was a tear-jerking story - and one that sugars and distorts the tragic but ugly truth about this sorry episode. For whether we like it or not, large numbers of those coming ashore in Sicily were not refugees fleeing persecution or war. Many were economic migrants, who may have come from countries run by despots, or live on less in a year than most in the West get paid in a week - but who have now slipped into Europe illegally with few questions asked. The port-side party atmosphere also seemed offensively incongruous. For next to the noisy quayside welcoming party stood a line of hearses waiting to take five bodies to a Sicilian morgue. They were the migrants who had drowned after the boat upturned - the ones who had not been so lucky. The hearses would be in use again shortly afterwards. A second boat full of migrants capsized the following day and up to 30 were feared drowned as another 88 were hoisted to safety. But it's not just Sicily. Across the water on Italy's mainland, the southern port of Salerno yesterday received more than 1,000 migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who had been recovered by a Norwegian ship. As soon the Siem Pilot docked, those most unwell were taken on stretchers to makeshift medical tents set up on the quay. Among them, 173 were found to have scabies. The arrivals, including tens of pregnant women and at least 107 children, many clutching teddy bears, then lined up to fill in registration forms and have their photographs taken by immigration officers. Officials said they came from 20 countries, mostly Sub-Saharan, including Nigeria, Mali, Cameroon, Somalia, Gambia, and Senegal. They had departed from the Libyan city of Sabratha on Tuesday night in dinghies. What seems incontrovertible about the biggest migration crisis in Europe since the Second World War is the extraordinary number of people who are prepared to risk their own lives, and even their children's, to reach the West. Yes, the risks are huge, but they understand that the odds of survival are stacked in their favour, and greedy people-traffickers in Libya encourage them by telling them so. And there is also an official safety net: under EU rules, member countries have a duty to send their navy to rescue anyone in peril on a vessel in their own territorial waters. These rescue vessels simply act as a magnet for more migrants to try the crossing. They know that if they reach Italian waters, they will most likely survive and be taken to their destination even if the smugglers' craft in which they are sailing does not make it. What is certain is that some of those brought to safety in Porto Empedocle this week will have vanished from Italy within weeks. They will simply walk out of the migrant hostels after taking a hot meal and a shower. Last year, a staggering 47 percent of the 153,000 migrants who arrived in the country did not even attempt to claim asylum. Many ran away, travelling to northern Europe to try their luck at getting into prosperous Britain, Germany or Sweden. Of course, some do stay in Italy. In the midst of economic woes, the country has been forced rapidly to extend its hospitality. Last year the highest number of migrant housing places Italy had to provide was 67,000. This March that had risen to 106,000. An increasing number of them are unaccompanied children less than 18 years old. They have been sent as forward scouts by their families back home, who one day hope to join them. Each migrant, whether a grandmother, a young man looking for work or a baby, is an extra mouth to feed, another human to clothe who needs a bed to sleep on. No wonder Italy is buckling under the strain. The EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini estimates that half a million more migrants are currently waiting in Libya hoping to reach Europe on traffickers' rickety boats. Migration experts have said the true number could be twice that figure. For other paths to Nirvana are closing. Migrant numbers on the route from Turkey to Greece, through the Balkans and up to northern Europe have dwindled in the face of border checks and barbed wire fences in less welcoming Austria and Hungary. More than a million people reached Europe that way last year after Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel invited in all Syrian refugees fleeing civil war and the horrors of the Islamic State which has taken over swathes of their country. What a can of worms she opened. What a seismic shift she has caused in Europe. For countless numbers of those who took up her offer were not refugees from beleaguered Syria at all. Thousands upon thousands chanced their luck by pretending to be Syrians, while in fact they fact hailed from the Balkans, from Albania, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Morocco, Egypt, Iran, Iraq or from Africa. Today, safely in Germany, many don't even bother to lie about their background and no sanctions are imposed on them for their deception. Last year I did actually meet Syrian in Calais, a well-dressed man who had booked in to my hotel there. The 32-year-old was a civil servant who had reached Europe by sailing from Turkey to mainland Greece on a traffickers' boat. Once there he headed north to France by train. I am going to Britain,' he told me with certainty at the French port. I have the cell phone number of an agent here in Calais who I will pay to hide me inside a car on a ferry to Dover. I am not going to wait with these other migrants in the mud of the camps. They are not Syrians. They are from Africa and Afghanistan where there is no big war like ours.' When you look at the latest asylum claims in the UK, you realise what he said is right. The figures have jumped by more than a third to the highest annual level for more than a decade, according to the Office for National Statistics. In the year to March, the largest numbers came from Iran, followed by Eritrea, Iraq, the Sudan, and Pakistan - all countries which certainly have their troubles but nothing like the difficulties facing Syria. Indeed, Syria accounted for only 2,500 of the total 34,687 UK applications. Libya's former dictator Colonel Gaddafi, before he was deposed and killed in 2011, promised the West that he would turn Europe into a Muslim country if the EU did not support his power struggle with insurgents and extreme Islamists. He threatened to allow traffickers to operate unhindered - they already existed on a limited scale in Libya - and let them flood our Continent. Last month, Frontex, the EU Border Force, warned that terrorists are infiltrating Europe by pretending to be refugees. It pointed out that two of the bombers in last November's Paris attacks arrived on a smuggler's boat from Turkey. At the G7 summit in Japan this week, David Cameron warned that Islamic State is gaining a foothold in Libya, and pledged Britain would send a Royal Naval warship to patrol Libya's coast to help tackle people-smugglers. But he failed to acknowledge that it was his own gung-ho decision to help remove Gaddafi using British armed forces that reduced Libya to the terrifying anarchy it is in today. Frankly, the Prime Minister's gunboat diplomacy smacks of gesture politics. The plan is for the vessel to turn back smugglers' boats - but there are simply too many of them. At the G7, the Mr Cameron said the migrant challenge would take time to solve. With more boats packed with eager passengers setting sail from Libya for Italy each day, time is what we have not got. © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2016-05,0,Migration
12,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,15/10/2015,685 words,BY JAMES SLACK AND IAN DRURY,OUTRAGE AS UN SAYS BRITAIN'S REFUGEES POLICY IS LIKE 1930S,"A SENIOR UN official triggered outrage last night by comparing Britain's response to the Syrian refugee crisis to decisions taken in 1938 which he claimed paved the way for the Holocaust. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said the rhetoric being used by politicians in the UK and elsewhere in Europe had echoes of the years leading up to the Second World War. He said that at the 1938 Evian Conference - called to discuss the growing number of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution - politicians turned their backs on German and Austrian Jews on the grounds that taking them in would destabilise their societies. This reluctance, he claimed, helped Hitler to conclude extermination could be an alternative to deportation. Mr Al Hussein - who appeared to take a swipe at both Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May - said the same arguments were being used today. He said: It's just a political issue that is being ramped up by those who can use the excuse of even the smallest community as a threat to the sort of national purity of the state. Closer examination of what happened in Europe in the early part of the 20th century should make people think very carefully about what they're saying. Why is there so much amnesia? Why don't they distil from experience that they've been down this road before and it's a very unhappy road.' Tory MPs said the comments were offensive' and appalling'. Mr Al Hussein also said the use of terms such as swarms of refugees' - language used by Mr Cameron in relation to the Calais immigration crisis - were deeply regrettable. In an interview published by the Guardian newspaper, the Jordanian took aim at comments by Mrs May that uncontrolled immigration made it impossible to build a cohesive society'. Asked whether he believed Mrs May would also come to regret her choice of words, he added: These are human beings: even in the use of the word migrants, somehow it's as if they don't have rights. They all have rights just as we have rights.' Tory MP Andrew Percy said: The idea that the debate around the Syrian issue could in any way be similar to Nazi persecution of the Jews is offensive. This kind of comparison is so overblown and so disgusting it undermines a sensible debate on how to address the migration crisis. The UN would be much better targeting the massive human rights abuses in parts of the world where their members are committing them.' Sir Bill Cash, a veteran Tory backbencher, said: These remarks are abhorrent. It is an obscene comparison to make which is totally unjustified. There are realities that have to be faced up to, and these include the fact that we have to distinguish between real refugees acquiring asylum and economic migrants or those who might be hidden jihadis.' Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: I entirely reject any characterisation that this country does not have a proud record of welcoming refugees or showing compassion in these circumstances. When I look at the £1.1billion we have targeted at those in most need, those fleeing persecution, to give them hope, it is that sense of compassion and focus that this Government has demonstrated, helping hundreds of thousands of people.' During Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron also defended the Government's record on Syria and its pledge to take 20,000 refugees over the next five years. He told MPs: We are the second largest bilateral donor to Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, in Lebanon and in Turkey. We have done more than almost any other country to help Syrian refugees.' It is the latest in a string of political attacks on Britain by the UN. In July, the special representative on migration, Peter Sutherland, said Britain's xenophobic' response to Calais was being exaggerated beyond belief' to inflame tensions in regard to the number of people coming into Britain'. And in May, Francois Crepeau, the UN's special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, said Britain risks taking the path of Nazi Germany if it pulls out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

But there are still strains in the Coalition over how high the eventual numbers could go. And last night, fears were growing that one of the county's oldest Army camps is to close down as a military facility to make way for the displaced families. The sprawling Gormanston base in Co Meath is being considered as a potential temporary new home for hundreds of fleeing Syrian families, the Irish Mirror has learned. Although it is still a working barracks used by the 28th Infantry Battalion, its proximity to Dublin Airport and the M1 motorway make it an ideal site to house refugees. But if the former Aer Corps base is to be used, hundreds of prefabs will be needed to accommodate the Syrians under the emergency refugee accommodation plan. A source said: ""The numbers being talked about are going to present very Enda Kenny serious problems. Sure there are a number of empty barracks available but given the numbers we're beginning to hear, these alone could not accommodate the numbers being proposed. ""Gormanston has nearly 260 acres and despite the fact there are some security issues, it could easily become a small town."" This would not be the first time the camp, which began its life as an RAF base in the First World War, is used to house refugees. At the start of the Troubles in 1969, large numbers of refugees, mainly from Belfast, moved across the Border to escape the violence and were housed at Gormanston. By October 1971, more than 12,000 people had passed through it. Yesterday, the Taoiseach denied there was any split in the Coalition over the amount of refugees that should be accepted insisting: ""There is absolutely no split in what we want to do as a government."" Enda Kenny said refugees must be allowed to seek asylum to escape IS, who he claimed wants to ""blow up Newgrange"". He added monuments such as the Co Meath attraction and the Rock of Cashel would be offensive to jihadists, adding a special Cabinet meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the crisis. But he again would not give an exact number of refugees despite Tanaiste Joan Burton saying the country should take 5,000. The Taoiseach added: ""When people say, 'How many are you going to take in?', I want to see the European model here first of all. Why do they have to cross the sea at all, if you are in a position to assess if they are eligible for relocation or asylum status? ""Don't be just fixated on a number, Ireland will do what it can."" Meanwhile, the Immigrant Council of Ireland called on the Government to start planning for the refugees to arrive. Chief Brian Killoran said: ""While much of the debate has been about numbers of people being admitted to each country - there has been a lack of focus on meeting the needs of those arriving. pat.flanagan@irishmirror.ie Graphic   DECISION Enda Kenny",Tabloid,0,2015-09,1,Policy

EU leaders and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu last night agreed to a ""one in, one out"" scheme to deter perilous crossings to Europe. Turkey will be handed £4.6billion under the deal. It includes £500million from the UK, but Britain is not obliged to take refugees from the scheme. The UK currently takes 20,000 refugees a year from Syrian camps. This will not change under the new deal. Human rights campaigners branded the plans a ""dark day for humanity"". Leaders including David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, at a crunch summit in Brussels, agreed the EU would take one Syrian refugee from Turkish camps for each migrant sent back from Greece to Turkey. Any migrant coming ashore in Greece after midnight will have a quick interview to decide whether they are allowed to remain. Most face being returned under the hardline stance. A spokesman for European Council President Donald Tusk said the removals would be ""in full compliance with international and EU law"", with no collective expulsions. Mr Cameron said the plan ""really could help make a difference"" in reducing migration and shutting down traffickers' trade. The Prime Minister added: ""We will work together to stop migrants from leaving Turkey in the first place, to stop at sea those that do leave and turn back the boats, and turn back to Turkey those that do make it to Greece."" But Kate Allen, of Amnesty International UK, said: ""This is a dark day for the Refugee Convention, a dark day for Europe and a dark day for humanity. It's shameful to see leaders seeking to abandon their legal obligations."" The EU has also pledged to speed up talks on Turkey joining the union. ben.glaze@mirror.co.uk Q&A WHAT IS THE DEAL? Refugees and migrants trying to enter the EU will be sent back to Turkey from Monday morning. Turkey gets £4.6billion in aid and its citizens could get visas to Europe. WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US? Britain will pay £500million to Turkey from the overseas aid budget to boost relief work. But the Government's plan to accept 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020 remains unchanged. WHY ARE CHARITIES AGAINST IT? They fear refugees will be forced to stay in cramped Turkish camps - or give more cash to people smugglers so they can try to enter Europe again.

Hundreds of migrants staged a mass sit-in, blocking a major crossing point, as Hungary declared a state of emergency after closing its border. It came as German Chancellor Angela Merkel piled pressure on David Cameron and other EU leaders by demanding an emergency Brussels summit next week over the crisis. Hungary's government has rushed through tough anti-migration laws, meaning those trying to enter illegally will be jailed. More than 60 refugees were arrested yesterday. Groups pouring into a no-man's land area between Hungary and Serbia refused to move, making threats to starve themselves to death if they were not allowed to pass. Dozens angrily threw down bread, tubs of chocolate spread and bottles of water given to them by charities. BODIES Aasif Abdullah, from Afghanistan, said: ""We will not eat this food or drink their water until we can cross this border. We will die here on the road, we will starve ourselves to death and then they will have to pick up our bodies from the streets. ""Is that what Europe wants? We do not want to stay here, we want to pass and will not move from here until we are allowed to."" A young boy was lifted up to hang a T-shirt, daubed with the words ""Europe Shame"", on the three-metre-high wire gates. While IIHAN Sadi, from Syria, shouted: ""Remove these borders. ""Remove these police otherwise we will not move ourselves. We have travelled hundreds of miles to be here and suddenly now we cannot pass. Where is the humanity in this? Show me. GREECE ""They offer food and Syrian girl emotional water but we will not take it."" Women wailed and children cried as the crowd surged forward, banging on the gates. Hundreds chanted ""we want to pass"" and ""no food, no water, until you open this border"". In further harrowing scenes, 22 migrants drowned and 211 were saved yesterday when a boat capsized off after arrival Turkey's coast while trying to reach Greek island Kos. It came as more Syrian refugees arrived at Piraeus, near Athens, on a passenger ship. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban vowed to shut out tens of thousands of migrants by securing the country's southern frontier. The crackdown means police can detain anyone who tries to breach the 110-mile wire fence put up on Monday. Those caught face an automatic jail term of 12 months to three years.

Meanwhile, Erno Simon, of the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, warned of t an ""impending humanitarian crisis"". Sources said Hungary had also angered Western European nations for its handling of the crisis. Yet EU states including Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Finland have introduced new border controls too, effectively ending the 20-year Schengen Agreement of free movement across much of Europe. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere yesterday made a veiled threat that the UK and other EU nations reluctant to take in thousands of refugees could face penalties from Brussels. He said: ""We need to talk about ways of exerting pressure. These are often countries that receive a lot of structural funds from the EU. ""European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested we should look at whether these countries should get less structural funds, which I agree with."" And Mrs Merkel called for support from the whole EU, with an emergency council being held next Tuesday to reach an agreement on relocating 120,000 asylum seekers from frontier states. A No10 spokeswoman said David Cameron yesterday had ""a good discussion"" with Polish president Andrzej Duda about tackling ""the root causes of the problem"".

EARLY last year, I spent 10 days at a UN refugee camp in Kurdistan, northern Iraq, where 8,000 Kurds sought refuge from the civil war raging in Syria. They were fleeing the Assad regime's assault on their identity and livelihood, but reluctantly. These were not economic migrants - they lived in brick houses, drove cars and held down professional jobs. IS had not been heard of… My job, for a fantastic Italian charity EPOS was to provide political education to the refugees - why were they there, what could they do, how could they contribute? We ran classes every day in big tents. We employed refugees as assistants, interpreters and tutors. We explored citizenship, human rights, the risks of human trafficking, community organising, campaigning. First, they explained, after shelter and clean water (we were in a bleak featureless desert 50 miles from the main town), they wanted iPhone chargers. frustrated Then they campaigned for a secondary school since the UN only provided a primary facility and the teenagers were becoming restive, frustrated and angry. It is now built and working well. Third, they debated whether to build a mosque or was that creating too much stability? Some remembered the Palestinians who had been living as refugees in Damascus for 50 years. They wanted to go home. One day, a young girl explained she was dipping back across the border, to now famous Kobane, to attend an exam. Another older man apologised for missing my social media class because he had to go home to plant seeds for the next harvest. When the lights failed, as they often did, I called a halt to the day's classes but they begged me to continue, turning their phones upwards to illuminate the dingy tent. They drew pictures for me when I left. Would I take them in to my house now? Of course. Do I think they want to flee across Europe to our islands? No. Do I think they need encouragement and support? Yes, of course. Graphic   VIEWPOINT Quintin Oliver",Tabloid,0,2015-09,1,Conditions

They all say the same…to go home and feel like children again; AMANDA HOLD DEN VISITS SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP EXCLUSIVE","Watching groups of kids battling it out on stage as they performed their best dance moves, songs and magic tricks was like any other day at work on Britain's Got Talent for Amanda Holden. Just as she does when she judges the ITV show, Amanda asked the youngsters what they would do with their cash prize if they won the competition. But these children did not light up at the thought of going on holiday or helping their local community centres. These kids just wanted their lives back. Because Amanda was watching a very different version of the talent show, one based in a camp housing Syrian refugees who have dodged bombs, bullets and sexual slavery in a desperate bid to flee their war-ravaged homes. Amanda says: ""I basically treated it like the show and joked around with them saying, 'What's your dream?' and, 'The next two minutes will change your life'. The response was like a movie. ""Literally every child kept saying the same thing, 'We want to go back to Syria, we just want to rebuild our homes, we just want our childhoods back, we just want to feel like children again'. ""And obviously that's not a prize that will ever be available to them."" They called the show Zaatari's Got Talent after the refugee camp in Jordan where they now live. There was a banner, judging table and a bell instead of a buzzer. Amanda, 46, says: ""They were so, so good. ""There was a boys' choir who sang a song for Syria and, even though it was in a different language, I understood the sentiment and the song because you could see the emotion in their faces. ""I thought to myself, 'I need to tell Simon Cowell that we need to get a camera into this camp'."" Amanda spent two days in Jordan, visiting the Zaatari camp 25 miles from the Syrian border and the Makani centre in Amman where children get psychological support to help them cope with the trauma they have experienced. Mum-of-two Amanda spoke to 13-year-old Rasha, who fled from her hometown, the Syrian capital Damascus, after her school was hit by a bomb when she was just eight years old. Rasha was in the playground with her best friend when the blast struck. Most of the boys playing football around her were killed - but that was not the worst of it. She saw her best friend with horrendous head injuries, the blood splattering across Rasha's face. Rasha was so traumatised she stood still for a week, stupefied by the death that was now part of her everyday life. But that was not the end of the terror for Rasha. She later saw her mother electrocuted by soldiers and her two brothers were shot. Rasha herself was brutally dragged by her hair and hurled against a wall by soldiers. Her mum suffered numerous strokes as a result of the torture and trauma she endured and now does not recognise Rasha, her youngest child. As Amanda places a sympathetic hand on Rasha's knee, the teenager asked her: ""How can I ever be happy? I've lost everything. I smile, but inside I'm crying. I feel so much pain inside. ""Not only have I lost my friends, but I have lost my mum, who doesn't recognise me, and my family is separated as half my family are in Syria."" Amanda, who was visiting Jordan in October with Save the Children as part of their Christmas Jumper Day appeal, struggled to compred hend the barbarity these children have witnessed. In 2011, she and husband Chris Hughes were devastated when their son was stillborn. She described her grief as ""overwhelming"". Just a year later, she almost died herself giving birth to her youngest daughter Hollie. But the refugee camp was beyond anything Amanda had ever experienced before. She says: ""Obviously I have had my fair share of trauma. But after seeing these people I said, 'Nothing is as important - whether it's a new haircut, or a new car - as my kids' health, my husband, my parents and my family."" We're all alive and love each other and we're together. It made pain inside me think, 'Every woman in the world is a tiger when it comes to protecting and looking after their own children'."" There was one story which really hit home. Hadeel is also a mum of two, and her 11-year-old daughter Ayla is struggling to overcome shyness - just like Amanda's own daughter Lexi, also 11 But the cause of Ayla's shyness is horrific. The trauma of seeing soldiers threaten her family when she was just six years old left Ayla perpetually afraid for her life and struggling to speak. Hadeel, also mum to Yana, eight, was attacked by armed soldiers and frequently saw dead bodies lying in pools of blood on the streets. Ayla was in the camp for year before she had the confidence to speak again. She found the courage to perform a heartfelt song for Amanda, having seen BGT on smartphones. Amanda says: ""They were an amazing family. I really related to Hadeel as she has two daughters too and her daughter had to overcome a great amount of shyness, like Lexi. ""I said to Hadeel, 'How do you find the strength?' And she replied, 'You just have to, as a mother'."" The visit carried on affecting Amanda even when she returned to the UK. She says: ""We get to leave, we get to go and have a hot shower and settle down for the evening. I couldn't stop thinking about that. I felt immensely guilty that I had the choice to do that. ""This time of year it's freezing and their heating consists of big oil drums filled with fire. They are no longer in their homes with their families at Christmas. They literally have nothing."" Amanda found it tough telling Lexi and Hollie, five, about her trip. She bought two dresses for her girls from tailor Faris, 17, who works in the Makani centre. His work must sustain his family of eight, after his father died in Syria. Amanda says: ""These kids learn a lot of skills to prevent them from being taken as sex slaves and all the other horrendous things that can happen. ""Hollie loves her dress. But she couldn't even get her head around the fact that some of these children don't have their mummies and daddies."" But Amanda did take positives from her experience. She says: ""It was amazing to see the sense of community in the camp. The joy inside those buildings in Jordan is overwhelming. ""That sense of family is everything. In moments of trauma, you do think, 'The only thing that's important is my family, their health and our love for each other'.""

EU chiefs in Brussels yesterday drew up plans to relocate 160,000 refugees across Europe. But the UK has opted out of refugee policies. Senior Tories yesterday added their voices to cries of anger from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP over Mr Cameron's refusal to help. Tory activists are also calling for temporary refugee camps to be set up in the British countryside. Mr Cameron said on Tuesday the only solution was peace in the Middle East. But he struck a different tone yesterday when questioned about the heart-rending photos of a young boy who drowned in the Mediterranean. He said: ""As a father, I felt deeply moved by the sight of that young boy. ""Britain is a moral nation and we will fulfil our moral responsibilities. ""We are taking thousands of Syrian refugees.

As a Unicef goodwill ambassador, he sat in a community centre in Amman, Jordan, and heard the stories of teenagers, who had no idea he is a Hollywood star. Neeson, 64, said: ""They are all our children. They want peace, they want to be recognised."" The Co Antrim actor's visit to Jordan this week was his first to the troubled Middle East for Unicef, one of a number of UN agencies and aid groups trying to ease the plight of displaced Syrians and their host communities. Nearly five million refugees, half of them children, have fled the civil war since 2011 and settled in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. The Arab kingdom hosts close to 660,000 displaced people, most living in the poorest areas where locals complain the influx is pushing up rents and driving down wages. Neeson and his son Micheal, 21, visited the centre which is run by community group Johud. Here Syrian and Jordanian teenagers get to know each other after school. The programme is funded by Unicef and run by the Jordan-based Generations For Peace. After watching the youngsters compete in a race, the star sat with them on the tiled floor. Ahmed, a 15-year-old Syrian, told him he used to get into fights with a Jordanian boy now they are like brothers. Reema Mohammed, also 15, from the capital Damascus, told him a Jordanian girl used to bully her at school and the centre helped her cope. Neeson said he was particularly inspired by the girls, including those he met on a tour of Za'atari, Jordan's largest refugee camp. The Taken star added: ""I thought they would be more oppressed because of their culture, and of course because of the ordeals they have been going through, coming from Syria, the horrors there. These girls I met they are so positive, so eager and keen to learn."" The Ballymena actor asked them what they want to be and was delighted to hear their responses included engineer, mathematician, police inspector and teacher. He added: ""To see these girls being empowered by education and the focus in their eyes was incredibly humbling and very moving."" But Unicef says about 700,000 school-age Syrians are starved of education because there is no space for them in overcrowded schools or because they have to work to support their families. In Jordan and Lebanon, many schools are running double shifts to try to accommodate the refugees. Asked about the backlash against asylum seekers in Europe and US, Neeson said: ""We in the West tend to have a bias against Muslims, a sweeping generalisation because of what these fanatical fundamentalist groups will do in the name of God, in the name of Allah."" Being raised in the North, he added: ""I kind of grew up cautious very, very cautious. I have kind of seen it in some of the kids here, in their eyes - but once you engage them and talk to them that rapidly disappears."" While he's a huge name in Hollywood, Neeson took his lack of celebrity status in Jordan in his stride. He joked: ""I was appalled. It is kind of refreshing [the kids] saying, OK, thanks for coming to our school but who are you?"" news@irishmirror.ie 660 Hundred thousand refugees have fled to Jordan since 2011 ""They are all our children.

The men, women and children, some of whom had lost loved ones in the bitter conflict, arrived at a former hotel in Ballaghaderreen, Co Roscommon, which has been transformed into an emergency reception centre. Justice Department officials told local representatives in January about the plans to transform what was the Abbeyfield Hotel. There had been concerns over the capacity of the town to cope with the arrivals, but yesterday there was a real appreciation from the refugees who were delighted by their welcome. Mum of two Jenan Hussein, in her early 30s, said she felt happy to be in Ireland and had often felt lucky simply to wake up every day before her family left Syria early last year. Through an interpreter she added: ""I went to sleep every night in the hope of waking up the next day. I felt like I died 10 times and passed away from all of the bombing."" Jenan travelled to Ireland with her mother Seham, daughters Ahman, nine, Judi, six and 19-year-old nephew Ghasan after almost a year in Greece. Syria has been ravaged by civil war since 2011 with several factions and foreign belligerents involved. The most recent estimate by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research puts the death toll at 470,000. It's thought 10.9 million people (about half of the population) were displaced and 3.8 million made refugees. Welcome banners were placed in the former Abbeyfield Hotel as locals, Irish Refugee Protection Programme officials and orientation staff greeted the visitors with a guard of honour. The new arrivals, more than half of whom are children, will stay for six months at the centre before being settled in other parts of the country. They have six computers which they can use as an internet hub to contact relatives at home, while Moroccan chef Ali Derazzi will cook halal meals for the families. ""Welcome packs"" of essentials including nappies, wipes, toiletries and baby wipes have been provided by local chemists, Molloys and Murphys, while book shops have donated books in Arabic. Seham Hussein, 62, looked very content and relaxed as he watched the younger members of her family settling in. To see the welcomed us is We are very She said: ""The reception, the people, everything was very welcoming. SEHAM ROSCOMMON, ""I am very happy to get out of war. I feel very settled and I'm willing to settle even more. ""To see how the Irish have welcomed us is great and we feel very Irish safe and secure. We are hoping for a better future ahead. ""We just registered and we said we wanted to be relocated to another foreign country [after Greece] because we can't go back to Syria obviously. ""We wanted a country that would accept us and to make us feel like we used to feel in our home country. We are very happy."" Asked about what she h d had heard about Ballaghaderreen, she said: ""I did not know a lot. What I did hear was it was a quieter place but all I care about is being settled, being secure and being safe. ""When we were in Greece we heard Ireland is a very nice country. The people are lovely and what is most important is to feel welcomed and appreciated."" Seham's grandson Ghasan said his mother and father Roma and Atman were relieved when he left Syria as they were very worried about his future. He said: ""My parents and my brother and sister are still in Syria. I had to leave because the army is compulsory in Syria so I escaped. ""In a year my family will come and join me. I am very happy to be here. I feel like I wasted 11 months in Greece. We were homeless and we had no life. ""I always had the hope of finishing my education and I am very happy I can now do that here. I really like to work in the media in the future."" The Department of Justice requested the refugees were not photographed yesterday. A spokeswoman said some of their relatives in Syria had suffered ""reprisal attacks"" after new arrivals were photographed in their host countries. Shane O'Connor of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme said: ""There are challenges when you are opening a new centre. ""The centre has to comply with fire regulations and that type of thing but we also need to make it a welcoming place. We need to make it a home."" news@irishmirror.ie ''To see how the Irish welcomed us is great.

353,src_dailymirror_raw.docx,Daily Mirror,22/12/2015,700 words,NA,Three months after tragic Aylan washed up on beach the exodus continues...; GOAL on plight of Syrian refugees during perilous journey to safety in Europe,"THE ruthless people smugglers at the centre of the refugee crisis are still profiting from their vile trade. Even for those who reach dry land from war-ravaged Syria, the journey is only beginning as they struggle to get to Europe...and again face being fleeced by gangs of thugs selling empty promises of a brighter future. Three months after images of little Aylan Kurdi's lifeless body on a Turkish beach rocked the world, the desperate exodus continues. Here GOAL's communications officer David Williams tells how the heartbreaking crisis continues to unfold day after day in the Turkish city of Izmir. UP to recently, Izmir's Basmane district was best known as a base for tourists with dollars in their pocket and adventure on their mind. Now this part of Turkey's third most populous city presents a grim reminder of the Syrian war and the refugee crisis it has spawned. Sitting under a telephone kiosk at one end of the street a young Syrian woman wraps her baby tightly in a shawl. She holds the tot close to her chest to protect it from the chill of the December wind. Her husband stands over them holding a plastic bag, presumably with some of the possessions they intend to bring with them to Europe. Thousands of others like them walk the streets. At night they crowd into cheap accommodation, take refuge in mosques or huddle together in doorways. And they all wait for the call. The side streets and alleyways off the main strip are the shadowy areas where these desperate refugees grease the palms of smugglers who they hope will transport them safely to the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios or Samos, and in so doing so, to Europe. Adozen or so shops on Fevzi Pasa Boulevard, one of the district's main drags which normally trade in clothes, luggage and other goods, now offer outside their doors cheap life-jackets and inflatable rubber rings. We sit down with three Syrians. Mohammed, 30, was up to recently a tradesman living in a town not far from the port city of Tartus in western Syria. His 24-year-old wife Riham had been studying archaeology. Her sister Amena, 27, was travelling with them. She recently graduated from university in Damascus. Amena's husband had travelled to Germany four months ago and was waiting for her there. They know better than most about the journey their fellow refugees have come here to undertake. Two nights ago their attempted crossing went badly wrong. Although they were told their inflatable dinghy would be 12m long and would be occupied by just 35 people, that wasn't the case when they arrived at their departure point. Instead, the smugglers had arranged for almost 50 people to board a boat no more than 5m in length. Still, they climbed in, such was their desperation to get to Europe. A few minutes into their journey the boat struck a rock and sank. Within seconds the passengers found themselves struggling to remain afloat in the freezing waters of the Aegean. Somehow they all managed to scramble on to the rocks that seconds earlier had ruptured their dinghy. They clung there for nine hours until the Turkish coastguard spotted them at 5am and brought them back to shore. The refugee crisis may not be making the headlines as it was this summer and autumn, but it is still a crisis. Syrian people are still taking the same risks and they are still being driven here by the same factors. Until the conflict is over and they feel safe to remain where they are they will continue to come to Izmir and pay hundreds of dollars to men who care little if they survive the journey by water. In total, more than 3,560 people have died in the waters of the Mediterranean this year. As we sat down later that night my Syrian colleague Adnan wiped away a tear as he remembered Amena's courage when we asked her whether she was scared of what lay ahead. She said: ""Why would I be frightened? I have lived through four years of war. I am not afraid. I am a Syrian.""

4424,src_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,10/12/2014,488 words,Ruth Sherlock,Britain 'shutting out Syrian refugees'; Aid agencies accuse Government of closing its borders and say it must do more to resettle people fleeing the conflict,"THE British Government is failing in its responsibility to resettle refugees who have fled the conflict in Syria, aid agencies have told The Daily Telegraph. The United Nations hosted a conference in Geneva yesterday aimed at encouraging countries to pledge to take more refugees from Syria, which faces the biggest humanitarian catastrophe in modern history.  While many countries are participating at ministerial level, Britain is represented only by its ambassador to the UN in Geneva and is not expected to make any meaningful commitment to resettle more refugees on its soil.  ""We see this as a signal that Britain is not prioritising this [issue] as they should,"" said Camilla Jelbart Mosse, Syria campaign manager for Oxfam.  Britain has been heavily involved in the war, backing the opposition to the Syrian regime when protests began in 2011, and later providing non-lethal support to rebel groups. However, its borders have remained almost totally closed to Syrians whose livelihoods have been destroyed.  Thus far the overwhelming burden of the refugee crises has fallen on countries neighbouring Syria, including Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, who are struggling to cope with an influx of more than four million people.  The UK declined to join the United Nations' resettlement programme, which was designed to help manage the burgeoning crisis, instead setting up its own Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme for Syrian refugees. Under the scheme, which began this year, only 90 Syrians have been resettled in the UK.  The Government has said it expects that number to grow into the ""hundreds"" over the next three years. Even if that is the case, international aid agencies have said, Britain will still be lagging behind in comparison to the help being offered by other European nations.  Germany has so far resettled 20,000 refugees, and Sweden another 9,000.  ""The [British] numbers are pitiful, and dwarfed by the need in the region,"" said Karla McLaren, government and political relations manager with Amnesty International. ""By their own rules they could admit more people: the scheme is meant to be based on need rather than filling an established quota. But the number of places offered so far do not reflect this.""  A means assessment of rich countries by Oxfam, supported by 35 other major international charitable organisations, claims that for the UK to play its role in the crisis, it would need to resettle 10,000 refugees by the end of 2015.  A Government spokesman said: ""The UK has been at the forefront of the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Syria, having pledged £700million, making us the second largest bilateral donor.""  The UN will resume food aid to Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries after a scheme offering food vouchers ran out of money, the World Food Programme announced yesterday. About 1.7million refugees will have their electronic food vouchers topped up by mid-December.",Broadsheet,1,2014-12,0,Policy
4693,src_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,12/6/2015,1229 words,NA,Austerity at home and profligacy abroad - foreign aid is a mess,"ll British civil servants are in a panic over spending, but not the same kind of panic. Most wonder how they'll police the streets, or defend the realm, on an ever-shrinking budget. But officials in the Department for International Development (Dfid) are seized by a different terror: they have to sink an average of £30 million a day in overseas aid. Under bizarre new legislation it's against the law for them to fail - so they spend all day looking, desperately, for legitimate ways to bury the cash. As you might expect, this is leading to rather unusual results. Wind farmers in the South Pacific, fishermen in Madagascar, all have ended up the unexpected beneficiaries of Dfid's seemingly unlimited largesse. It's not all about helping the poor, nowadays, but about whether a project can be categorised as Official Developmental Assistance (ODA). Under a new law, passed three months ago, ODA must amount to at least 0.7 per cent of national income. Those present at National Security Council meetings now ask if a military deployment is ""odable"" [sic]. If it is (helping with Ebola, for example), then the cheque is written - and the larger the better. If not (helping the Iraqis confronting Isil, for example), then austerity rules. This has been the case for years now, leading to a grotesque distortion of government priorities. The military budget has fallen almost as quickly as the aid budget has risen - and with disastrous consequences. After Colonel Gaddafi was deposed, the British military was keen to do more to train the troops of Libya's new government to keep the peace. But they were told there was no money left. The opposite instruction was issued to foreign aid officials: they came under immense pressure to spend as much as they could and ended up splurging £62 million on providing legal and police training. This was not much use when the country collapsed into civil war. David Cameron only acted there to save lives of Libyans set to be massacred in Benghazi. His intervention was certainly foreign aid, of the most urgent kind - but it wasn't ""odable"". So the military was pulled back, and the divisions of consultants deployed instead. Under the system Michael Howard unwisely signed the Tories up to 10 years ago, the British Prime Minister has no power to decide what counts as foreign aid. So there is no point arguing, for example, that HMS Bulwark rescuing immigrants from the Mediterranean should count. The decision about what is ""odable"" is made in Paris, by accountants from the OECD. Austerity at home, profligacy abroad: this bizarre combination means that Britain takes in a pitifully small number of Syrian refugees. But when it comes to funding aid camps, we stump up more than the rest of Europe put together. Every time there is a natural disaster, the British government makes a stunningly generous pledge. But when it comes to honouring our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, we seem not to have any money. As they say in Whitehall: if it's not ""odable"", it's not doable. All of this might be more defensible if British overseas development was a great success. But it is now depressingly clear that the £30 million-a-day spending target is also deforming our aid, at the expense of the welfare of the very people we are supposed to be trying to help. We know a lot more about this because, to his immense credit, Mr Cameron has created a fully fanged watchdog. The regular reports of the Independent Commission for Aid Impact have been steadily building a picture of what is going wrong - and the damage done when foreign aid is judged by how much it costs, not how much it achieves. The latest of these reports, published yesterday, spells it all out. Time and time again, inspectors encountered examples where ""ambitious spending targets"" seemed to take priority over considerations such as whether the poor were being helped. ""When we asked one contractor what Dfid meant by 'impact' the response was: 'it doesn't come up very often',"" the report said. This is not to condemn the men and women who do such work at Dfid: they are obeying instructions, and the main instruction is to spend. But as the report says, the ""pressures on Dfid staff to meet ambitious spending targets"" can ""create incentives to overlook problems"". So aid becomes more bureaucratic - and less humanitarian. The report also discusses Dfid's habit of making grandiose claims that look commensurate with its gargantuan budget. Take its claim that it ""helps nine million children in primary education"". This sounds impressive, until you learn how they count it. If Dfid chips in 2 per cent of a country's education budget, it claims to ""help"" 2 per cent of the children. The measure is not only arbitrary, but self-defeating: if a foreign government is persuaded to spend more on schools, as actually happened in Punjab, the UK share of its school budget falls. And, by its absurd logic, Britain is seen to ""help"" fewer children. Or take the goal to ""reach"" 20 million young children and mothers with nutrition programmes. As the report's authors reveal, officials can claim to have ""reached"" a woman by handing her a deworming tablet, ""irrespective of whether this led to improvements in nutritional status"". Aid agencies who work for Dfid told the inspectors of their dismay at being under pressure to deliver ""superficially impressive"" results, rather than ""meaningful and lasting"" help. In this way, the needs of the starving are subordinated to the needs of a boastful government bureaucracy. This is not to say that Dfid is a giant scam; the majority of its work is effective and urgently needed. But it is simply growing too fast to ensure the money is well spent. Its budget has doubled in seven years, chiefly to give politicians an applause line to slip into speeches. Even that doesn't work: George Osborne moans that he is lambasted, rather than applauded, when foreign aid is brought up by voters. The average household now has to give the taxman £400 a year to spend on a charity of his choice. This grates not because Brits dislike helping the poorest. We have done so for generations, generously, and in many ways. Add up the private money going to poor countries then Britain, as a country, has long met the 0.7 per cent target. Justine Greening, the International Development Secretary, has done what she can. She has shut down failing programmes, cut back on aid to undeserving countries and sought to have the phrase ""value for money"" reverberate around her department. But given that Mr Cameron put the spending target into law, her orders are clear. Her officials will always think that their work is mainly defined by cash, not outcomes. It's strange: Mr Osborne rightly boasts that Labour's borrow-and-spend orthodoxy was defeated at the last election. But it still governs Dfid. There is a Conservative alternative. The Prime Minister should recognise that Britain always has been a country where people give generously; the Government's role is to top this up, where appropriate. There are a great many things the state can do best, like nationwide vaccination programmes. But Dfid should be released from the legal target and allowed to spend only what it thinks it can properly manage. Its remit - to save the lives of the world's poorest - demands no less.

While Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, insists she wants to keep Europe's borders open, plans leaked to a German newspaper yesterday suggest her government is drawing up measures to reinstate its own national controls. In what Welt am Sonntag called a ""clear threat to the EU"", sources said Germany was considering turning away asylum-seekers at the border. Such a move could leave countries that have been critical of Mrs Merkel's ""open-door"" refugee policy struggling to cope with hundreds of thousands of migrants. Sources close to Thomas de MaiziÈre, the interior minister, told the newspaper he had ordered officials to draw up plans to close the borders. ""For de MaiziÈre, the time of waving the refugees through is over,"" they said. Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's vicechancellor, has commissioned a report on the possible economic consequences of closing the country's borders. In Bavaria, the state government has ordered police to make preliminary preparations to reintroduce permanent border controls and start turning away asylum-seekers. Any closure of Germany's borders would have to be approved by Mrs Merkel. The latest decisions appear to be an attempt to put pressure on other governments ahead of an European Union-Turkey summit next Monday. Mr de MaiziÈre has decided the summit will be the ""turning point"", according to Welt am Sonntag. If EU leaders cannot agree a joint strategy to tackle the crisis at the meeting, Germany is prepared to take unilateral action. Mrs Merkel has been leading negotiations for EU states to take in a fixed quota of Syrian refugees from Turkey in exchange for Turkish help reducing the flow of migrants into Europe. But she has faced growing opposition from a number of European countries that say they will not accept quotas. Austria and several eastern European counties have called for Greece's northern borders to be closed as an alternative way to stop the influx. That has left Greece fearful it will be left to deal with the crisis alone. Mr de MaiziÈre's intervention appears to be an attempt to turn the tables on other European governments, warning that if Germany closes its borders they will be left to deal with the influx. Germany is understood to have drawn up plans to turn asylum-seekers away by enforcing the EU's Dublin regulations, under which asylum-seekers must register their claim in the first member state they reach. That could leave countries across the continent scrambling to send refugees back to their first point of entry in the EU. While other governments have been critical of Mrs Merkel's ""open-door"" refugee policy, Germany has long complained that it has been left to shoulder most of the burden alone. ""Germany has to enforce the restriction on its share with its own measures, if necessary also without EU regulation,"" Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian state interior minister, said. He called for Germany to impose a daily limit of 500 to 600 on the number of asylumseekers allowed across its borders. Austria has already imposed a similar limit in defiance of the European Commission, which warned it was illegal under international law. Hans Peter Doskozil, the Austrian defence minister, said Mrs Merkel's government ""should be grateful"" for the Austrian limits, which have dramatically reduced the number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany. But Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, poured scorn on the idea his country can close its borders to asylum-seekers. ""We have to take on this responsibility - we cannot behave like Austria or Sweden,"" he said. 'For de MaiziÈre, the time of waving the refugees through is over'",Broadsheet,1,2016-02,0,Policy

The EU country's migrant crisis escalated as police fired tear gas at its main processing centre and the government announced 2,000 ""border hunters"" to reduce the number of people entering. With more than 2,500 migrants crossing from non-EU Serbia on Tuesday alone, pushing the total for the year above 140,000, Hungary's Right-wing ruling party said it wanted to deploy the army. In the village of Roszke, on the border with Serbia and close to the town of Szeged, police fired tear gas at 200 migrants, who became agitated when they were informed that they were to have their fingerprints taken. The mainly Syrian and Afghan migrants fear that, in line with EU rules, if they are stopped later elsewhere in the union they will be returned to Hungary as their official point of entry. ""If I get fingerprinted in Hungary, I don't go to Germany,"" explained Abdul Majed, a 25-year-old language student from Syria. ""We make fingerprints in Germany, so you will be a refugee in Germany, not in Hungary."" Exhausted families trudged along the road through Serbia, hoping to get across the border into Europe, then continue north into the wealthier parts of the continent - such as Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. ""It's been very, very difficult,"" said Odei, a Syrian migrant from Deraa, once he reached Hungary. ""We were here from yesterday. We are very hungry. There's no food, there's no medicine for the children, there's nothing. We are so tired."" Yesterday saw another record day for arrivals, with 2,533 detained - up from 2,093 the previous day. More than 10,000 migrants, including many women with babies and small children, have crossed into Serbia over the past few days and headed toward Hungary - meaning that the records for arrivals will continue to be broken. The government of Hungary, lead by the Right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, has begun construction of a fence, built out of three layers of razor wire, along the border with Serbia in an attempt to stem the flow of arrivals. Mr Orban has ordered that an 11fthigh fence be built along the 110-mile border. It is expected to be completed in the coming days. But it is hardly a formidable barrier. One group of migrants, including women and children, crawled under it yesterday, using blankets, sleeping bags, jackets and a stick to raise the wire. As a police car approached, they dashed through a field. Water cannon will also be sent to Szeged, the largest city in the region. And, as construction of the fence is fi-nalised, helicopters, police dogs, horses and 2,106 extra border patrol officers have been dispatched. Karoly Papp, the chief commissioner of Hungarian police, said the officers ""don't have and will not get an order to shoot"". Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, said parliament would debate next week whether to employ the army in the border effort. A Western Balkan summit will be held in Vienna today, with migration high on the agenda. The EU yesterday released (EURO)1.5 million (£1.1 million) worth of humanitarian aid for refugees in Serbia and Macedonia, on the day that Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, urged countries to show compassion and do ""much more"" to end the crisis. ""Today there are more people displaced than at any time since World War Two,"" said Mr Ban, speaking in Paris. ""In Syria and elsewhere, millions of people flee violence and persecu-tion. Others try to escape poverty and seek ways of living with dignity. ""By our intervention, we must save lives, fight against trafficking and discrimination, bring judicial solutions, examine the profound causes of problems and defend human rights."" The Serbian prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, said yesterday that his country will never close its borders to migrants. He said EU leaders must help frame a plan on how to cope with the influx, but said: ""We speak about desperate people. You cannot stop the flow of life with fences.""

Angela Merkel and François Hollande called for an overhaul of the EU's asylum system, following emergency talks on the migrant crisis in Berlin. An official source confirmed reports that Germany had suspended deporting asylum-seekers from Syria under the EU's Dublin Regulation, which states that migrants can only apply for asylum in the first EU state they enter, and face deportation if they try to apply in another. But Germany, which has long complained that the system is failing, has ordered its officers to process applications from Syrians even if they have made their way through other states. ""Germany and France expect all member states to implement fully the right of asylum,"" said the German chancellor. The French president added: ""We must implement a unified asylum system. There are moments in our European history when we face an exceptional situation. Today is an exceptional situation."" The two leaders both called for migrants to be shared more evenly between EU states. They want to see a common list of ""safe countries"" to try to separate genuine refugees from economic migrants, and for EU registration centres in Italy and Greece, where most migrants arrive after crossing the Mediterranean, to be set up by the end of the year. Germany saw a third night of violent far-Right protests on Sunday against a shelter for migrants, in Heidenau, Saxony leaving more than 30 police officers injured. ""It's disgusting, how Rightwing extremists and neo-Nazis are trying to preach dull hate messages,"" Mrs Merkel said yesterday. Mrs Merkel and Mr Hollande are believed to want an EU summit on the crisis. But Jean Claude-Juncker, the European Commission president, said there was no need for talks. Mr Juncker, who has struggled to win support for EU quotas to distribute 60,000 migrants through the Continent, wrote in France's Le Figaro newspaper that leaders must show ""courage"" and take unpopular decisions. ""Instead what I see is finger-pointing - a tired blame game which might win publicity, maybe even votes, but which is not actually solving any problems,"" he added. In the Balkans, there were scuffles yesterday between Macedonian police and migrants on the Greek border, as officers let through a trickle of people heading north to Hungary, a member of the Schengen free movement area and a major point of entry to the EU. Since the border was reopened following clashes over the weekend, nearly 10,000 people have poured across and on into Serbia, many on foot and including some pushed in wheelchairs and wheelbarrows, or moving on crutches. The migrants, largely from Syria, Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan, are following a route north from Greece into Macedonia and Serbia, and then onto into Hungary and richer EU countries such as Austria, Germany and Sweden. Hungary is rushing to build a fence to block the flow. In Austria, police said 37 people were injured, seven seriously, when two vans packed with as many as 90 migrants collided yesterday near the Hungarian border. The flow of people across the Mediterranean is continuing. Greece's coastguard was searching for at least five people missing after their dinghy overturned off the coast of the island of Lesbos. The coastguard said it had picked up 877 people in 30 operations from Friday morning through to yesterday near Lesbos, Chios, Samos and Kos. On Saturday, the Italian coastguard plucked 4,400 people from off the coast of Libya.

A survey by the Bertelsmann Foundation found that the majority of Germans still say immigrants and refugees are ""very welcome, or quite welcome"". But the number of people who felt Germany had reached the point where it could no longer afford an unconditional welcome had risen to 54 per cent, up from just 40 per cent in 2015. ""Many feel that the maximum limit has been reached,"" said the report. ""The readiness to take in more refugees has significantly fallen."" Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has faced strong criticism for her ""open door refugee policy"", which caused up to a million refugees and migrants to enter Germany in 2015. The following year a number of domestic terror attacks were carried out in Germany by Afghan and Syrian refugees. In July 2016, an Afghan injured five people in an axe attack on a train, while a Syrian killed himself and injured 15 others in a suicide bombing. The most serious incident, on Dec 19, saw a failed asylum seeker from Tunisia plough a truck into a Christmas market stand in Berlin, leaving 12 dead. Anis Amri, 24, entered Germany in July 2016, after the EU-Turkey deal and the closure of the Balkans route significantly slowed the rate of migrants and refugees entering Europe. The study was released shortly after Mrs Merkel told a Syrian journalist that refugees must respect tolerance, openness and freedom of religion. ""We expect the people who come to us to stick to our law,"" she said. The Bertelsmann Foundation's study also showed a clear divide in opinion between east and west Germany in attitudes towards refugees. Around 65 per cent of Germans in the west said they would welcome refugees ""with open arms"", compared to just 33 per cent in the east. It came as the German government yesterday announced steps to choke off state campaign finance for the far-Right National Democratic Party (NPD), after a failed court bid to outlaw the xenophobic fringe group. The initiative aimed to deprive the NPD of Germany of taxpayers' money, to which German political parties are generally entitled, before September elections. Handing government funds to the NPD amounted to ""a direct state subsidy for far-Right hate speech"", said Heiko Maas, the justice minister. Germany's highest court had in January rejected a bid by the parliament's upper house to ban the NPD, ruling that although it held a similar ideology to the Nazis, it was too small to endanger German democracy.",Broadsheet,1,2017-04,0,Migration

He said they were likely to be international migrants who plan to claim refugee status here rather than seeking shelter in France because of ""perceived advantages"" in the UK. The judge spoke out as he handed down a landmark legal ruling allowing four young Syrian refugees to leave the camp and come to the UK so they can live with their brothers. The decision focused narrowly on their ""special, unique"" situation but paves the way for hundreds more to submit similar claims. One support group said that up to 300 people could now benefit. One of the four Syrians said: ""I'm very glad that my case is now going to open the door to so many others to get here safely, because in Calais I saw so many people of the age of 14, 15 and 16 risking their lives dealing with human traffickers and jumping on lorries and being beaten by others, which is not a way for minors to live or experience."" Mr Justice McCloskey, president of the Upper Tribunal of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, described the JS ungle as a ""bleak and desolate place"". The judge said: ""It seems likely that there is no real basis for many of its occupants remaining indefinitely in the Jungle and enduring the conditions that obtain there. ""Many are probably not refugees in any general sense or any sense entitled to recognition. Rather, they are migrant nationals of a number of countries outside the European Union, who, while intending to make a claim for refugee status, decline to make the claim in France due to perceived advantages, correct or otherwise, of doing so in the United Kingdom.""

In a growing crisis, the numbers in an encampment just over Jordan's northern border have ""skyrocketed"" in the past two months, according to Red Cross and UN officials. They say the majority have come from territory controlled by a reportedly weakening Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). Those few who are being let through - many because of medical emergencies - described dire conditions in a desert landscape with no water or supplies other than those provided by aid workers. ""It was a tragedy - hellish,"" said Amira, a 19-year-old from Isilcontrolled Raqqa province, who was allowed through to give birth. ""It was very hot and dirty. You just wanted to die. My blood pressure was dropping all the time,"" she said. She was treated by a doctor from the Red Cross, which won her a permit into Jordan from the local authorities. Amira asked not to give her proper name, saying her family was still at risk. She gave a picture of life under the ""caliphate"" that suggested the crisis will get much worse as Isil rule weakens. She said Isil was becoming more desperate and bloodthirsty. She and her husband, both from a rural area away from Raqqa city, Isil's headquarters, left for fear he would be forcibly recruited as the group ran low on fighters. She said her family were increasingly disgusted by Isil. ""They began slaughtering people in front of us,"" she said. ""They would do it with knives for any reason, if you curse Allah or even something smaller."" Hala Shamlawi, of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the numbers in the camp had ""skyrocketed"", partly as a result of the Russian bombing campaign since September. Aid workers put the number at about 30,000, up from just 3,000 at the end of last year, while the Jordanian government's most recent figure is 26,000. The government insists it is still processing entry permits, at between 50-100 a day, but that it has to protect its own borders. King Abdullah, in a BBC interview last month, said fears of Isil ""elements"" among the refugees had made the issue a ""red line"". Mohammad al-Momani, the information minister, said: ""We have serious concerns that among these people are terrorist organisation infiltrators. If any country would like to take them, we would send them in our own aeroplanes."" He said border guards were allowing aid workers through to help the refugees.

In a major blow for Brussels, Turkish government sources said they would not change domestic law to grant Afghans and Iraqis refugee status in Turkey, which would prevent them being deported to warzones. In order to deport migrants to Turkey, the EU needs guarantees that they will be cared for in accordance with international law, and will not be sent back to warzones. Only Syrians are recognised as potential refugees under current Turkish law. But 24 per cent of those landing in Greece are Afghans, and 15 per cent are from Iraq. Yesterday confusion reigned on Lesbos, the main destination for many of the refugees hoping to reach Europe, after a deadline passed at midnight on Saturday meaning all new arrivals face deportation. The influx since the deadline surged to 1,600 by 7am as the flotilla of flimsy dinghies continued. Migrants ""react with disbelief "" when told they will be deported, one aid worker said. EU sources admitted the 2,300 EU officials who will implement the deportations will not start arriving until next Monday. ""A decision came through from Brussels for political management of the crisis, but there is no clarity on how to execute this,"" Spiros Gallinos, the mayor of Lesbos, told Sky News. ""It was a rushed, if not forced, decision. For one and half years the EU policymakers dragged their feet. Then overnight they came up with a decision they want us to enforce within two days."" One police officer said: ""The orders seem to change every hour."" Local offi-cials also questioned whether deportation to Turkey would deter migrants from another attempt. ""They will return and try again,"" warned Marios Andriotis, an adviser to the mayor. ""We have been saying from the beginning to do the registration in Turkey and ship those who are in need of protection over here."" Friday's (EURO)6 billion (£4.7 billion) aidfor-deportations deal with Turkey contained no written commitment that Turkish law would change, merely a commitment to comply ""with the relevant international standards"". But officials insist they received verbal assurances, in private meetings with the Turkish delegation, that the legislation would be altered. ""For us, the commitment is to change the law,"" said an EU source. ""If they don't, we won't send people back."" Turkish government sources also insisted no one would be forcibly sent back - a baffling claim given the EU is converting reception centres into detention camps surrounded with barbed wire to hold migrants, who will be removed by a task force of 1,000 Greek soldiers and 1,500 foreign police officers on to chartered holiday ferries. Further confusing matters, sources at EASO, the EU's asylum agency, that will be advising migrants on their claims, said that people with immediate family in Europe could avoid deportation and win the right to rejoin their loved ones in western Europe. The proportion of women and children among asylum seekers has surged to six in 10, as mothers and wives attempt to follow men who successfully made the trip to Germany and Sweden last summer. However, this was contradicted by European Commission sources, who said its legal position was that rules on family reunification did not ""trump"" the power to send people back to Turkey. It was also confirmed that the onefor-one relocation scheme, which will see those migrants who are deported ""swapped"" for Syrians currently held in Turkish camps, is voluntary, raising questions about how many states will volunteer to take the Syrian refugees. The deal has been criticised by international organisations. The UNHCR agency said it had stopped co-operating on the Greek islands, including suspending a bus service used to take migrants to reception centres, saying it objects on principle to detention. ""The deal is being implemented prematurely - the necessary safeguards are not yet in place,"" said Boris Cheshirkov, a spokesman for the UNHCR, which has been tasked by the EU with supervising the deal. ""Greece does not yet have the capacity or staff to deal with this and the facilities are not up to standards that guarantee a dignified environment."" Amnesty International said the deal ""is seriously legally and morally flawed"". But a spokesman for Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said: ""We have to make this work. We don't have time for comments."" Kosovan leader's brother sought refuge in Germany The brother of Kosovo's prime minister was among more than a million migrants who sought asylum in Germany last year. Isa Mustafa, the Kosovan leader, admitted that his brother Ragip requested asylum days before the PM attended talks with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. Mr Mustafa said: ""This shows that my family members also face the same destiny as other citizens."" The admission is likely to provoke anger in Germany, where economic migrants from Kosovo are seen as abusing Mrs Merkel's ""opendoor"" policy.

The assertions, contained in a leaked memo, appeared at odds with Mr Cameron's insistence yesterday that his approach to the referendum would be ""wholly positive"". Speaking at the conclusion of a Brussels summit, he said he believed Britain's membership of the EU was beneficial and that reforms would make it even more so. He said that his policy of meeting all 27 European leaders to discuss his plans rather than ""kicking over the table"" and making ""immediate demands"" was the right one. But Charles Michel, the prime minister of Belgium, suggested Mr Cameron was not being ""open and frank"" enough and urged him to go beyond ""vague intentions"". The leaked memo was yesterday seized on by Eurosceptics. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said it exposed the Prime Minister's renegotiation strategy as ""one giant con"". The memo, obtained by The Guardian, says that the Prime Minister has the ""firm aim"" of remaining in the EU. It says: ""He believes that people will ultimately vote for the status quo if the alternatives can be made to appear risky."" The Prime Minister apparently suggested ""Angela and Matteo"" - referring to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Matteo Renzi, the Italian Prime Minister - have responded positively to his proposals. It is claimed the French were ""warier"" over reforms to welfare. The note says: ""He [Mr Cameron] said that he needed to win the middle ground and, if he is to achieve this, then moderate people needed to feel that the things that bother them about the EU have been dealt with."" Mr Cameron used the European summit to make his pitch for EU reform, but a row over migrants left him with just five minutes to make his point. One source described it as a ""commercial break"" while legal papers were prepared. The European Council issued a brief, 27-word statement in which it said it would ""revert to the matter in December"". Mr Cameron clashed with EU leaders after he blocked attempts by Germany and Italy to make Britain take migrants from the Mediterranean. He rebuffed attempts to force Britain to take a quota of refugees from the Mediterranean, warning that such an action could encourage more migrants to come. Pressed by Germany, Italy and other nations to accept a share of the 40,000 migrants who have arrived in Europe after fleeing from Syria and Africa, he used Britain's opt-out to block the demands. He later warned that the approach was ""counter-productive"" because it could ""act as a draw"" to come to Europe. Aides insisted that Britain can ""hold its head up"" because it is now taking 1,000 asylum seekers a year after extending a scheme to help Syrian refugees.

More than 3,300 migrants landed on Spanish shores in the first four months of 2017, up from 1,063 in the same period last year, the UN's International Organisation for Migration said. The report followed a surge in boat arrivals over the past week. Yesterday the Spanish coastguard rescued more than 100 migrants from three boats near Alborán, a rocky island outpost halfway between Spain and Morocco. In the past week, more than 200 people, including a number of pregnant women, were picked up along the Andalusian coastline in half a dozen boats, more than half of them on Saturday alone. On Sunday, a rubber dinghy carrying 34 people, including nine women, caught fire when its outboard motor exploded 16 miles off the coast of Alborán. The flaming vessel was spotted by the Portuguese air force, patrolling as part of the EU's Frontex operation, as its passengers leapt into the waves. With the aid of a local fishing vessel and the Spanish coastguard, all of them were pulled out alive and have since been transferred to Granada. Spain has now surpassed Greece in the numbers of migrants dying in its waters. Fifty one migrants have been killed crossing the Mediterranean to Spain this year, while 37 have died in the Aegean Sea, where the EU's migrant deal with Turkey has deterred many from attempting the journey. The crossing to Italy - accounting for 80 per cent of European arrivals by sea - remains by far the most deadly, with almost 1,500 people killed in 2017. Almost 59,000 migrants have traversed the Mediterranean to Italy this year, a nearly 50 per cent rise on the same period in 2016, when just over 40,000 made the journey. But the latest figures indicate that the Western Mediterranean route, as the crossing from Morocco to Spain is known, is reestablishing itself after years of waning activity. While the proximity of the two countries has historically made this an entry point to Europe, cooperation between Moroccan and Spanish authorities kept migration relatively low. One of the reasons for the route's growth is thought to be the effective closure of the passage through Greece and the Balkans. The EU's deal with Turkey, under which Syrian refugees arriving in Greece are to be processed and sent back to Turkey, has led to a huge drop in crossings. So far this year 7,043 migrants have taken the Eastern Mediterranean route to Greece, according to the IOM figures, down from 156,267 over the same period in 2016. The majority of the migrants crossing from Morocco to Spain hail from sub-Saharan Africa, though Syrian refugees are also known to use the route. While a decade ago it was mostly favoured by economic migrants from north Africa, increasing conflict in countries such as Mali, Sudan, Nigeria and the Central African Republic is now also fuelling the push northwards. Maria J Vega, a spokesman for UN High Commission for Refugees in Spain, said: ""It is a worrying situation - this increase means that there are more people desperately trying to reach safe countries and they are risking their lives at the hands of smugglers and traffickers.""",Broadsheet,1,2017-06,1,Conditions

Mark Rowley, a Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner, said that Syrian-based terror network has shifted its focus from small-scale attacks on the police and Armed Forces to ""more determined and more ghastly"" atrocities such as those seen last year in Paris and the downing of a passenger jet in Egypt. ""Going from that narrow focus on police and military as symbols of the state to something much broader, and you see a terrorist group which has big ambitions for enormous and spectacular attacks, not just the types that we've seen foiled to date,"" he said. A shared effort to look for any links with Daesh-trained networks that have reached the UK was obviously ""a massively high priority"", he added. The Met announced that any ""marauding"" attack by terrorist gunmen would be publicised on the force's Twitter account to give the public early warning and advice on action to take, which would save lives, officers hope. Meanwhile, under a radical shakeup of migration law planned by Brussels, David Cameron is expected to demand that his European counterparts protect Britain's ability to deport asylum seekers. The European Commission wants to replace the Dublin rule, that allows states to send asylum seekers back to the first state they arrive in, with a system of quotas that will split migrants among the states. Mr Cameron said there is ""no prospect"" of Britain joining a quota system, due to its ""absolutely rock-solid optout"" on common home affairs policy. But diplomats must battle to keep the Dublin powers, which allow the UK to deport 1,000 asylum seekers a year, to avoid an explosive row in the middle of the Brexit debate. Leaders will be presented with four options next Wednesday. A Downing Street source said: ""We've always been clear that we support the Dublin convention. Because it's the system that is the right one in terms of when people arrive in a safe country, that is where they make their asylum claim. We have held that position for a long time."" An EU official admitted the timing clashed with the referendum debate, but said: ""You can't stop doing things because of the UK referendum."" Chris Grayling, the Eurosceptic Leader of the Commons, warned that terrorists could use migration routes to come to Europe, and said that Britain would ""certainly"" be affected by the shake-up. ""There is a very real danger that that safeguard disappears and we end up unable to send asylum seekers back to any country they have come from,"" he said. Meanwhile a study in England found that public opinion is less hostile to immigration than it was five years ago - but that that does not mean welcoming more Syrian refugees. Research for the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate found that the number of people concerned that immigrants could threaten their job has halved from (23 per cent in 2011 to 12 per cent) and the share who see immigration as ""good for the country"" has risen from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. But only 12 per cent thought the Government's plan to take 4,000 Syrian refugees a year was ""too few"", while 43 per cent thought it was too many. 1,000 The number of asylum seekers Britain currently deports each year under the EU's Dublin convention",Broadsheet,1,2016-03,0,Policy

The death toll - about 10 souls a day - doesn't really change but the methods of killing them do. Last week, for example, we learnt about 200 migrants who set sail from a port in Libya. After a few hours, the people smugglers ordered them to board a new, already-overcrowded boat in the middle of the sea. It sank under the weight of the new arrivals; entire families died together. ""I saw my wife and my two-month-old child die at sea, together with my brother-in-law,"" said one Ethiopian survivor. ""They died in a matter of minutes."" From the outset, David Cameron has recognised this people smuggling for what it is: one of the greatest new evils of our time. It's now a huge industry, worth about £4 billion a year. The smugglers offer not just transport but the ability to game the system, either with fake passports or help with an asylum claim. This trade in human lives is greatly helped by the prize dangled by panicked politicians: that those who survive the journey, and end up on European soil, will be granted asylum. It's a promise born of compassion, but has helped to lure hundreds to their deaths. To his great credit, the Prime Minister has played no part in this. He has been wonderfully clear: Britain will take in 20,000 refugees but it will fly them in directly from the Middle East. To take those who arrive in Europe, he says, is to play the game of people trafficking - an enterprise that Britain wishes to eradicate, rather than support. On top of that, his Government is giving £2.3 billion to help those fleeing war in Syria. And on top of that, the Royal Navy is to help save the lives of those making the crossing. It's not just that Britain is giving more than any country in Europe; we're doing more than the rest of Europe put together. Which makes it so odd that Mr Cameron is now under attack for not doing enough. The problem comes down to his point of principle: taking refugees directly from the Middle East rather than Europe. This is being portrayed as a simple refusal to take refugees - and, ergo, proof of the blackness of his Tory heart. A parliamentary rebellion has succeeded in the Lords, but was defeated in the Commons on Monday. The leader of the rebellion, Lord Dubs, says he has not given up. Some Tories are wavering. And Lord Dubs, 83, is proving a potent foe because he arrived in Britain as a child refugee from the Nazis. We offered Kindertransport then, he says. Why not now? When the Thirties are mentioned, in any discussion, rationality tends to be thrown out of the window. Emotions run deep, as Ken Livingstone can attest. But this has been precisely the problem with the refugee debate: at times, it has seemed like being more about politicians' depth of feeling than the fate of the actual refugees. The tens of thousands of unaccompanied migrant children, from all parts of the world, represent a very 21st-century problem. They deserve better than Second World War-era solutions, yet this is the prism though which most European leaders still see the migration crisis. First, this is not simply a story of children fleeing war. Only one in seven of the unaccompanied children who registered with European authorities last year is Syrian. About half were from Afghanistan, others were from Eritrea and Iraq. The Swedes have found a phenomenon of ""anchor children"" being sent ahead by their families, so as to stand a better chance of settling. And by no means all of them are necessarily children: when the Danes did tests recently (with dental checks and collarbone X-rays) they found that three quarters of them were adults. It's hard to blame those posing as children, or anyone who risks so much for the chance of a better life. The binary distinction between a refugee (who has a right to be accommodated) and an immigrant (who does not) might have made sense when the UN Refugee Convention was being drawn up in 1951. But the distinction is rather moot today. A Syrian fleeing war and a Somali fleeing poverty can end up in the hands of the same boat from the same people smuggler, risking being washed up on the same beach. When both are desperate enough to put their lives on the line (and the lives of their families), it's far harder to say that one has a valid claim for help, and the other is a criminal. The internally displaced, meanwhile, seem to have no rights at all. War destroys towns and families, but most of those facing starvation as a result have moved to a different part of the same country. If they cross a border, they're categorised as refugees and have some hope of assistance. If not, the world ignores them. Syria has five million refugees, but a further seven million are internally displaced. These sickening totals put our debate about 3,000 child refugees into perspective. Those serious about helping Syrians, rather than virtue signalling to a domestic audience, could look to Jordan, where there are 600,000 Syrian refugees in urgent need of assistance. This has been the focus of British efforts not just in aid but working with Jordanian authorities to let the Syrians work, rather than depend on handouts. And the children? Only last week, the British Government said it would take 3,000. But not just the unaccompanied children who are currently capturing the political imagination. We will take those on the United Nations' ""at risk"" register, which includes teenagers at risk of child marriage or sexual exploitation. It is now seven months since Angela Merkel tore up EU agreements and declared that Germany would give asylum to every Syrian who made it to her country. People smugglers from Turkey to Libya would have rejoiced at this news: the number making the journey over the Mediterranean has trebled so far this year. We can expect many more deaths as summer comes, and the crossings intensify. This is a tragedy, but at least Britain has played no part in making this tragedy worse. When leading his parliamentary rebellion, Lord Dubs summed things up rather well. ""Once in a while,"" he said, ""there are major challenges that test our humanitarianism."" He's right. Mr Cameron is about the only leader in Europe who has risen to this challenge, which is why it's so important that he does not back down now.

The grand bargain drawn up at a Brussels summit hopes to end deadly Aegean sea crossings and smuggling rackets, while encouraging refugees to stay in Turkish camps by offering them the prospect of a direct flight to the European Union. British taxpayers will pay £500 million in aid, up from an initial £250 million agreed in October, after EU leaders acceeded to Turkey's demand to double its payouts to (EURO)6 billion (£4.6 billion) by the end of 2018. In a host of sweeteners offered to Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish prime minister, new chapters of the long-running talks on Turkey's accession to the EU will be opened. And from June, 77 million Turks will gain access to the EU's Schengen zone for 90 days without a visa, under a significant relaxation of the rules. In exchange, Ankara agreed to ""readmit expeditiously all irregular migrants"" who land on the Greek islands and to station immigration officers on islands including Lesbos, Leros and Kos, according to a leaked draft text. However, senior EU sources told The Daily Telegraph that internal pre-summit assessments had sketched out a best-case scenario of reducing the number arriving in the Greek islands to 1,000 a day. This would be a cut from last Sunday's 2,480 migrants, and the peak last October of 5,600 to 6,000, but still amounts to 30,000 a month - a number that could overwhelm Greece since its northern border was sealed. Greek officials are more pessimistic and think 50,000 a month will still arrive. Turkey was offered an initial (EURO)3 billion payout in October, costing Britain £250 million, and David Cameron is happy to keep on paying after Ankara dramatically hiked its demands. ""If we've got a position where you know we're coping and dealing with the migration challenges, we're clearly going to not turn the tap off on that,"" said a British source. David Davis, the former Conservative shadow home secretary, said: ""We are being held to ransom by the Turkish government. The EU is a very weak negotiator in these matters."" President Racep Tayyip Erdogan yesterday goaded EU leaders. He said in a televised address in Turkey: ""The prime minister is in Brussels right now. I hope he returns with that money, the (EURO)3 billion."" Some 362,000 Syrians claimed asylum in Europe last year, 29 per cent of the total. It suggests that, depending on how far the influx drops, EU states face accommodating tens or even hundreds of thousands of migrants under the one-for-one policy. There are significant questions over how, in practice, migrants who had risked their lives and their savings to reach Greece by boat could be coerced on to deportation flights to Turkish camps. And experts fear the crackdown could open up new, more dangerous routes from Egypt and Tunisia to Italy. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian leader, threatened to veto the one-for-one scheme, warning it would only add ""fuel to the fire"" and cause even more people to come. ""Nothing should be done without the closing of the borders"". Hungary yesterday announced it would cut cash subsidies for asylum seekers and reduce the individual space they are allotted in detention centres to the size given to prison inmates. The Government said the move was to bring their rights into line with citizens, but human rights groups claimed it was simply to drive migrants away. Mr Cameron used the lunch of celery soup and sole to rebuke Mr Davutoglu for his crackdown on press freedom, following the government takeover of the main opposition Zaman newspaper on Friday. It emerged yesterday that nearly 40 clandestine migrants a day, many from the Calais ""Jungle"", were discovered in Dover and the surrounding area last summer. More than 3,600 migrants were picked up by the Home Office between July and September, in the first official indication of the full scale of the impact of the migrant crisis on Britain's border controls. Home Office officials last year repeatedly denied that figures were available on the numbers of migrants - both asylum seekers and illegal immigrants - who had reached British soil concealed in lorries or on Channel Tunnel trains. But figures emerged in a report by Peter Clarke, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, following an inspection of detention facilities at the ports of Dover and Folkestone. William Hague: Page 22 Ocean task force Britain's role in tackling people smugglers Britain's main contribution to the naval force gathered by Nato in the Aegean Sea will be RFA Mounts Bay, a 16,000 ton Landing Ship. This vessel from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary - with a deck of 1,200 square metres - has extensive medical facilities, enough space to hold 300 fullyequipped soldiers and a 'wet dock'. Mounts Bay would be an ideal platform to accommodate any rescued migrants without having to transport them to a shore base. The ship could be used as an offshore holding centre, perhaps before returning the migrants to Turkey. The ship has one Wildcat helicopter, designed for anti-submarine warfare but with the capacity to conduct surveillance missions over large areas of ocean. Mounts Bay, whose home port is Falmouth in Cornwall, also has a floating dock where ships carrying migrants could offload their passengers. Britain is sending two fast patrol boats, known as ""cutters"", operated by the UK Border Agency, to join VOS Grace, which is already in the region.

The refugees, who include Syrians, Iraqis and Eritreans, will be taken to France to relieve pressure on Germany, the French government has said. A further 24,000 refugees will be welcomed to France over the next two years, the president François Hollande said on Monday. The government is to hold talks with mayors and local officials this weekend to work out housing for refugees. But there is debate in France about public opposition to taking more refugees. A poll conducted by Odoxa for Le Parisien, after the images of the drowned 3-year-old boy Alan Kurdi had shocked the world, found that a majority of French people, 55%, were opposed to France acting in the same way as Germany by loosening its conditions for refugee status. A total of 62% of French people felt those fleeing Syria should be treated as migrants like any others. Only 36% felt Syrians should be given a better welcome as refugees from war. The historian Benjamin Stora, who heads the board of France's Museum of the History of Immigration, warned that the reasons for French public reticence went beyond France's current economic crisis and millions of unemployed. Writing in Le Monde, he argued that far-right ideology had permeated debate in the country and more must be done to reverse negative stereotypes in France, which was historically a country that had welcomed asylum-seekers.

Echoing an argument that has also been made by David Cameron, Duda said: ""In Europe the talk is all the time about fighting the systems, and not the causes of the crisis. Europe is in a kind of a closed circle."" Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz said last week that the European Union must help people who flee wars and Poland is ready to discuss its role but does not want to accept automatic quotas. block-time published-time 2.39pm BST  Hassan Abu Walied, a 45-year-old father of two from the war torn northern Syrian city of Aleppo has made it to a refugee camp in Nuremberg, after a journey of bribes and beatings via Macedonia and Hungary. He told the Guardian's Mona Mahmood why he shunned refugee camps in Turkey. If I had the choice, I would have chosen to go to Netherlands to apply for asylum, but the German police arrested me right after I stepped onto German soil and took my fingerprint. The camp in Nuremberg is congested with more than 750 Syrian, Iraqi, Sudanese and Albanian refugees. The queue for the breakfast in the morning can take two hours for a single man. The Turkish staff always give preference to families. ""You have to wait till the families have their breakfast or you will be sent back to Syria,"" they say. My main concern was to take my family out of Aleppo before we were killed by a random shelling or bullets from snipers. But I didn't want them to risk the journey to Greece. I thought about registering with the UN in Turkey to help get settled in Europe or the US, but the wait was too long. The UN said it might be 2022 before I could leave Turkey. I couldn't survive that long in Turkey without having any income. So I went with my two brothers who had lost their houses and businesses in Aleppo, and travelled on a shaky cracked boat filled with 50 refugees. The trip from Azmir cost us $1,150 each. We only got to the Greek coast after help from the coastguard. The boat's motor broke down after six hours at sea. I then used GPS to guide me to the Macedonian borders. I and many other refugees were kicked by the Macedonian police. They held us overnight and then started to release 10 refugee every hour. The situation at the Serbian borders was better but we had to pay to get there. The train ticket was (EURO)5 from Belgrade, but we had to pay (EURO)25, and when we got in the train, the inspector charged us another (EURO)50. We walked along corn fields and were then seized by the Hungarian police who would only release us after we paid (EURO)200. Then, we took a taxi for (EURO)650 to take us to Budapest. There we met a smuggler who transferred us by a van to Germany after paying another (EURO)475. The van was supposed to have only eight passengers but there were 20 of us inside. I used to live as a king in in Aleppo, with a thriving wood business, but there is no future in Syria. The war might last for another 20 years. I don't want my little kids to turn into beggars or thieves. I want them to have a good education in Germany and that's why I left Turkey for Germany.  Hassan Abu Walied Photograph: Handout  block-time published-time 1.49pm BST   Summary  Here's a summary of the latest developments: Germany could take 500,000 refugees each year for ""several years"", according to the country's vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel. ""I believe we could surely deal with something in the order of half a million for several years,"" he told ZDF public television. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has given her backing to the EU quota plan to accept an extra 160,000 refugees, but suggested the quotas were just a first step. She also called for an open asylum system to replace the Dublin III arrangement under which asylum applications have to be processed at the point of entry to the EU. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, warned of a refugee ""exodus"" lasting for years. ""The wave of migration is not a one-time incident but the beginning of a real exodus, which only means that we will have to deal with this problem for many years to come,"" he said. A record number of 7,000 Syrians reached Macedonia on Monday and a further 30,000 Syrians are in Greece, according to the UNHCR. It called for a ""guaranteed relocation"" system. Europe's border agency Frontex has offered to help Greece to increase the number of immigration screening officers on the islands of Lesbos and Kos. Frontex director Fabrice Leggeri, said: ""Greece is facing a critical migratory situation."" The UN has warned that the Schengen system of free borders faces collapse if Europe continues to fail to come up with a coordinated response to migration. Peter Sutherland, the secretary general special representative for international migration, said: ""Schengen most definitely could fall apart, and probably will fall apart if we don't get a common European policy in respect of migration."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has appealed to European leaders ""to be the voice of those in need of protection"" and to quickly find a joint approach. Ban spoke by telephone with several European leaders to discuss the migration crisis. Denmark has placed adverts in Lebanese newspapers announcing tighter regulations and cuts in provisions in an attempt to warn off asylum seekers. The advertisement published on Monday said that social assistance for newly arrived refugees was being reduced by up to 50% Al-Jazeera reports. block-time published-time 1.30pm BST  In her press conference Merkel also called for an open asylum system to replace the Dublin III arrangement under which asylum applications have to be processed at the point of entry to the EU. She said the Dublin system ""no longer works"" as it means that both Italy and Greece are left to take in the bulk of Europe's refugee influx.  ""We must discuss a new asylum policy,"" AFP reported her saying. Berlin has already stopped applying the rule for Syrians, and is allowing citizens of the war-torn country to apply for asylum in Germany irregardless of their first port of arrival in the EU. ""I'm seldom so convinced that this task will also determine Europe's future and whether the continent really accepts the value... of individual freedom,"" Merkel said. ""On this question, the whole world is watching. And we're not just saying Syria is so far away from us.

""This joint European asylum system cannot just exist on paper but must also exist in practice - I say that because it lays out minimum standards for accommodating refugees and the task of registering refugees,"" she told a joint news conference with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in Berlin. Earlier German's vice chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said Germany could take 500,000 refugees for several years. Merkel said that European Union states needed to find a joint solution to the refugee crisis, rather than threatening each other if they did not collaborate. ""I personally, and we spoke about this, am of the opinion that we should not now outbid each other with threats,"" she said. ""We should speak to each other in a spirit of mutual respect."" block-time published-time 1.04pm BST  At Roszke, Hungary's border town with Serbia, there have been more reports of scuffles between asylum seekers and the security forces.

Flavio di Giacomo of IOM Italy warned that his teams continue to encounter overloaded boats. ""We have seen that lately rubber dinghies, which used to carry up to 100 or 110 people, now cram 130, sometimes 140, migrants on board,"" he said. The IOM said it was encountering ""growing difficulties"" on the Greek island of Lesbos. Over 12,000 migrants reached the island between September 1 and 5. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 migrants on the island remain unregistered. During the weekend, conflict flared between the migrants and the authorities in the port of Lesbos and as a result registration procedures stopped. This aggravated an already tense situation. Police operating in the Moria processing centre could not provide the migrants, many of whom had walked long distances to be registered, with accurate information. IOM staff on the island noted that the registration process appears disorganised and consequently many Arab-speaking migrants are claiming to be - and are therefore recorded as - Syrian, in order to improve their chances for asylum.

Photograph: Frederik Sadones/Demotix/Corbis  A hastily refurbished government building last night opened its doors to 500 people opposite a refugee camp that has sprawled across Brussels' Parc Maximilien, writes Arthur Neslen. Around 1,000 people are camped out in the mushrooming tent city, which now has a school, hospital, canteen and sanitary facilities, all provided by an ad hoc alliance of social networks and NGOs. Many of the travellers from Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and Afghanistan are traumatised. ""I fled from Aleppo after planes dropped barrel bombs around my home,"" said Ziah Ramadan, 50. ""Our building was destroyed and whole families were killed. There were rivers of blood in the streets. I had to walk on the the dead bodies of my neighbours."" Two of Ziah's children were injured in the bombing and she was desperately seeking medical assistance for a son with shrapnel injuries to his back and arm, she said. After two months of waiting, she also wanted her asylum application dealt with urgently. Belgian officials say they are facing the country's worst ever refugee crisis, with more than 4,600 people making asylum requests in August alone. But the authorities have limited the amount of asylum applications they can process to 250 a day, as the crisis has escalated. A week ago, the Parc Maximilien camp only housed 150 people. Ibrahim, a 22-years-old economics student from Baghdad with earphones dangling from his neck, said that he had arrived in the camp via Hungary and Austria, just two hours before. ""It was crazy in Hungary. For two days, we were running from the police in the forest,"" he said. ""They chased us with taser weapons, shouting 'stop motherfuckers!' The police beat you if they catch you. We were in a group of more than 46 people but only four of us got through. All the others were caught"" Ibrahim, a Sunni, said that he had left Baghgdad after Shia militias strafed his house with bullets and shot at him in the street. The attack was led by sectarian relatives of his girlfriend, he claimed. Both Ibrahim and Ziah said they had been packed like cattle into refrigerated lorries en route to Europe, in transits during which they feared they might die. Ziah said that some travellers had perished on her journey. ""Most of these people are post-traumatic and experiencing paranoia and real difficulties,"" said Eloise Francart, a camp coordinator. ""Many were also injured in Hungary and Austria. Our medics tent is open 20 hours a day but we just can't fit any more people in."" Around the park, refugees and migrants are staging spontaneous demonstrations led by drummers that block the streets, in a bid to speed up their asylum applications. The camp buzzes with life and donations from local residents but it has been targeted by local thieves and drenched with rain. Even so, refugees rights groups say that last night, only 20-30 people checked into the government building, which has few showers and requires refugees to leave the building with their belongings every morning.

""I have no doubt about that, maybe more,"" the leader of the centre-left Social Democrats said, as Germany expects to receive 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, four times the 2014 total. However, Gabriel stressed that other European countries must also accept their fair share as refugees keep fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa and head for the 28-nation EU. ""We can't just take almost one million people every year and seamlessly integrate them"" into German society, he said. Germany would keep accepting ""a greatly disproportionate share"" among EU members ""because we are an economically strong country, without doubt"", said Gabriel. But it was unacceptable for the EU to keep relying on just a few countries, such as Austria, Sweden and Germany, he added, saying that ""that's why I am certain that European policy needs to change"". block-time published-time 10.09am BST   Tusk: Europe facing 'exodus' Donald Tusk Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images  Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, has warned that Europe is facing the start of ""a real exodus"" of people. In a speech at the Bruegel annual dinner in Brussels, he called for a response that the balanced solidarity with refugees and containment at Europe's borders. He said: Today, it is truly a paradox that the biggest countries in Europe, like Germany and Italy, need solidarity from others. At the same time we should seriously address containing the uncontrolled migration by strengthening the borders and getting the keys to our continent back from the hands of smugglers and murderers. The two approaches of solidarity and containment need not be mutually exclusive. It would be unforgivable if Europe split into advocates of containment symbolized by the Hungarian fence and advocates of full openness voiced by some politicians as the policy of open doors and windows. Today, I call on all EU leaders to redouble their efforts, when it comes to solidarity with the members facing this unprecedented migratory wave. Accepting more refugees is an important gesture of real solidarity but not the only one. An enormous effort is also demanded of the European institutions. Humanitarian efforts to contain migratory flows will require much greater engagement from Europe. It means a major increase in spending. When we talk about new reception centres, better protection of the borders or development aid for the countries outside the EU, much more money will be needed... But let us have no illusions that we have a silver bullet in our hands to reverse the situation. The present wave of migration is not a one-time incident but the beginning of a real exodus, which only means that we will have to deal with this problem for many years to come. Therefore it is so important to learn how to live with it without blaming each other. Also, we should not feel ashamed of our emotions. Compassion is one of the foundations of solidarity, but in order to be able to help others we ourselves must be pragmatic at the same time. We are now experiencing one of the most classical political dilemmas, that is a conflict between the protection of our borders and solidarity towards the refugees. Wise politics doesn't mean having to choose one value over the other, but to reconcile the two to the degree possible. In this case pragmatism should be the First Commandment. block-time published-time 9.50am BST   Migrants and refugees clash with Macedonian police forces as they try to break through a cordon to board a train after crossing the Macedonian-Greek border near Gevgelija, on Monday. Photograph: UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media  After overnight clashes in Lesbos the focus of the crisis in Greece has moved north to the country's border with Macedonia, our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens. Greek television this morning reported scenes of mayhem on the frontier with Macedonia where thousands of migrants and refugees have now gathered. And at first light police resumed a search and rescue operation in the hope of finding a 23-year-old Syrian father last seen struggling in the fast moving waters of the Axios river that separates the two states. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 newcomers, most brought in on cruiseships from Lesbos, arrived in Athens' port of Pireaus on Monday according to authorities. The Red Cross has rushed to set up medical facilities in a central square in the capital where it could be seen handing out food and water to new arrivals. Speaking on behalf of the organisation, Angeliki Fanaki who is coordinating the drive, said every effort was now being made to ensure that refugees were received with a level of dignity they may not have experienced so far. In Lesbos, where the vast majority, have been forced to sleep rough or in tents, with almost no access to running water or public toilets, conditions have become increasingly squalid. The minister of migration, Yiannis Mouzalas, himself a physician with Doctors of the World, described them as ""miserable"" after visiting the island on Sunday. An estimated 20,000 Syrians, Afghans, Iraqis, Iranians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have converged on the island's capital, Mytilini where some 27,000 locals live. ""It is an intolerable situation,"" said the island's mayor Spyros Galanos who has appealed to residents to boycott the country's upcoming general election and threatened to not open schools later this week if relief measures and emergency action aren't taken quickly. This morning many locals told Greek TV that after several days of street clashes between refugees and riot police, it had reached the point where they were afraid to leave their homes. The government has responded by opening a second reception centre to speed up processing of the newcomers - who have also fallen victim to crisis-plagued Greek bureaucracy - and laying on more ships to transit them to the mainland. But with ever more new arrivals from the shores of Turkey, no amount of emergency action appears to be adequate. On Monday, the Greek government appealed to the EU commission for 2.5 bn euros in emergency funding - usually reserved for natural disasters - to deal with the crisis. block-time published-time 9.38am BST  European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker is meeting officials in Strasbourg to finalise a quota plan to resettle refugees across Europe.

We'll start with a summary of the latest flash points and differing responses to the crisis: Fresh clashes have erupted overnight between police and refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos, which authorities warned was ""on the verge of explosion"". Coastguards and riot police armed with batons struggled to control around 2,500 people, screaming ""Keep back"" at the crowds as they surged towards a government-chartered ship bound for Athens. The Greek government and the UN refugee agency have brought in extra staff and ships to tackle the problem. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has appealed to European leaders ""to be the voice of those in need of protection"" and to quickly find a joint approach. Ban spoke by telephone with several European leaders to discuss the migration crisis. Hundreds of migrants have broken through police lines on Hungary's border with Serbia and are walking towards the capital, Budapest, the BBC reports. The migrants had earlier broken out of a registration camp at Roszke. A Syrian man who was pictured weeping as he and his family reached the Greek island of Kos last month has arrived in Berlin.

2179,src_theguardian_raw5.docx,The Guardian,3/6/2014,1547 words,Harriet Sherwood Helena Smith Athens Lizzy Davies Rome Harriet Grant,EU's looming migrant tragedy: Italy and Greece call for urgent action to prevent 'humanitarian catastrophe': UN fears of migrant tragedy in Europe,"The United Nations has been forced to consider establishing refugee holding centres in north Africa and the Middle East because of the spiralling numbers of migrants attempting perilous journeys across the Mediterranean in a desperate effort to reach Europe. The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, has said for the first time that the large-scale processing of migrants and refugees outside Europe, in countries such as Egypt, Libya or Sudan, may be necessary as frontline authorities claim they have been abandoned by Brussels in the face of a ""colossal humanitarian catastrophe"". Hundreds of thousands of people are preparing to make treacherous crossings on unseaworthy vessels from the north African coast to Greece and Italy as this summer's ""boat season"" gets under way, say officials. Figures for the first few months of this year already show a dramatic increase on previous years. UNHCR's European director, Vincent Cochetel, told the Guardian: ""We would not be totally against external processing if certain safeguards were in place: the right to appeal, fair process, the right to remain while appeals take place."" The EU had not found effective mechanisms to prevent migrants dying at sea, he said. Instead of focusing on ever tougher border controls, the EU needed to establish safe routes. Campaigners for refugee rights have hitherto rejected the idea of large processing camps outside Europe, fearing refugees would be at the mercy of states with poor records on human rights and justice. ""There's no way that could work,"" said Judith Sutherland of Human Rights Watch (HRW). ""In theory, HRW doesn't have a problem with creating channels of access to asylum in the EU from outside (but) you can't imagine (the right) conditions being met in Libya, or Egypt or Morocco."" Greece, which currently holds the EU presidency, is also pressing for the establishment of holding centres in north Africa and the Middle East to process refugees and migrants before they reach European soil. In addition, the Greek government is calling for an international seaborne taskforce to patrol the Mediterranean in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants. Greece will table the proposals at an EU summit next month, according to senior government officials in Athens. ""The shaping of a comprehensive immigration policy is one of the main priorities of (the Greek presidency), as well as the Italian presidency, which follows ours,"" Greece's deputy prime minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said. ""The Mediterranean countries of the EU are working together closely. But the Greek coastline is longer than the total coastline of the other member states. Without a substantial reassessment of (policies) . . . we cannot confront the crisis."" Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, Greece's merchant marine minister, said processing offices should be set up in Syria or Turkey ""to examine who is eligible, or not, before people get on boats, put their lives in danger and trespass our borders"". Italy has pledged to force the migrant issue to the top of the EU agenda when it takes over the presidency in July. ""Europe will not see an Italy banging its fist on the table, but an Italy that overturns the table,"" interior minister Angelino Alfano said last week. The latest figures show a rapidly accelerating problem. About 42,000 people have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Italy so far this year, according to the EU border agency, Frontex. Last year there were 3,362 arrivals by the end of April, said UNHCR. Last week, more than 1,000 migrants stormed a razor-wire fence at Melilla, a Spanish enclave in Morocco, in order to reach European territory, and 400 breached the barrier. The same day, French riot police bulldozed three camps holding hundreds of refugees in Calais. The Greek merchant marine ministry said 15,000 undocumented migrants attempted to enter Europe via Greece last year, requiring a third of the 7,000-strong Greek coastguard to be redeployed to the eastern Aegean. The numbers have been swelled by large numbers of Syrian refugees seeking to escape the civil war, which has displaced millions of people in the past three years. Some 7,000 refugees from Syria arrived on the Italian coast in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 350 in the whole of 2012. They are the second largest group to arrive by sea in Italy this year, after Eritreans. Most of those making boat journeys to Greece are Syrians, including women and children. Since the Greek government erected a 10.5km barbed-wire fence along its border with Turkey, 90% of illegal migration has been channelled through the eastern Aegean, with coastguards engaged in a daily battle with human traffickers. ""It's clear that the fence has rerouted the flow to the Aegean,"" said Sutherland. Another fence, planned for the Turkish-Bulgarian border, is likely to have a similar impact. ""The sealing of that border will lead to even more sea crossings,"" she said. In recent weeks there have been dozens of deaths in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas between Turkey and Greece. The Italian Red Cross has called for a ""humanitarian corridor"" to be opened for people fleeing war and famine. In a statement condemning the EU's inaction, Amnesty International said: ""With virtually no safe and legal routes into Europe, people are increasingly pushed into the hands of smugglers and traffickers, and are forced to risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels."" At least a third of those heading for Greece end up having to be rescued. Many boats are in poor condition and are overcrowded. In addition, ""migrants travelling in small inflatables have explicit instructions from traffickers to sink boats once they see the coastguard so they can be picked up in EU waters,"" Varvitsiotis said. ""We can't deal with this problem forever alone. Europe needs to have an equal burden policy."" Sicily has borne the brunt of illegal migrants heading for Italy since the temporary closure of a reception centre on the island of Lampedusa, and local authorities say they feel abandoned by Brussels and Rome. They predict a continuing rise in arrivals over the summer. ""If strong action isn't taken, it will be a disaster,"" said Enzo Bianco, the centre-left mayor of Catania and former Italian interior minister. ""Either there is a strong initiative by the Italian government and by the EU, or we will be facing a real disaster of colossal proportions. If we're in a crisis with 50,000 arrivals, imagine what will happen if there are 500,000-600,000."" At a funeral in Catania last week for 17 migrants who died off the coast of Libya, Bianco condemned Europe's ""deafening silence"": ""Faced with a looming, colossal humanitarian catastrophe, with almost 800,000 people on the African coast ready to cross the Mediterranean . . . Faced with these coffins, Europe must choose (whether to) bury our consciences of civilised men along with them."" After 366 migrants died off the coast of Lampedusa last autumn, the European commission set up Eurosur, a surveillance operation aimed at reacting more quickly to boats in distress. This was strengthened by the Italian search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum, which has so far rescued 30,000 people from the sea at a cost of more than euros 9m (£7.3m) a month. Italy says the headquarters of Frontex, the European border authority, should move from Poland to Sicily to deal with the growing crisis. ""Europe is distracted. But Europe can't pretend it's nothing. The problem exists . . . We need resources,"" said Luigi Ammatunna, the mayor of Pozzallo on Sicily's south-eastern coast, which has received 8,500 migrants this year. The cash-strapped Greek government said it spent euros 65m to protect the eastern seafront last year, with only euros 2m contributed by the EU. Rising numbers of refugees have fuelled support for rightwing politicians in Greece and Italy. The neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, which has focused on the issue, pulled off a surprisingly strong performance in local and European elections in Greece. The leader of the xenophobic Northern League in Italy, Matteo Salvini, flew to Sicily last month to demand an end to Mare Nostrum. Alfano, the Italian interior minister, adopted increasingly provocative rhetoric with Brussels during the European election campaign, threatening to defy EU asylum rules and ""just let them (asylum seekers) go"" out of Italy to other countries. Last week, he warned Brussels to shoulder the euros 300,000-a-day cost of Mare Nostrum, or the Italian government would deduct it from its EU contributions. Italy, he said, could not ""become the prison of refugees who want to go to northern Europe"". Meanwhile, refugees in Sicily are being housed in makeshift accommodation, such as schools and sports halls, with inadequate reception and processing facilities. The arrival of large numbers of migrants, including many unaccompanied children, ""creates problems for us - not because we don't want them, but because we want to provide a reception worthy of the name"", said Ammatunna. ""Receiving these people, then treating them badly, not giving them a proper welcome, not being able to give the services that we would like to be able to give them - this we do not want."" 21>= Continued on page 2 >= continued from page 1 Captions: The closure of a centre on Lampedusa has driven more refugees to Sicily",Broadsheet,0,2014-06,1,Policy

A report from the Council of Europe's assembly listed numerous concerns on human rights, from keeping migrants in overcrowded and insanitary detention centres on the Greek islands to inadequate legal protection for people seeking to appeal against rejection of an asylum claim.  The report also condemned Europe's ""shamefully slow"" progress on relocating refugees from Greece to other countries. Only 937 out of a promised 160,000 had been found homes as of March.  The EU-Turkey agreement ""at best strains and at worst exceeds the limits of what is permissible under European and international law"", states the report by the Dutch parliamentarian Tineke Strik.  ""Even on paper, it raises many serious questions of compatibility with basic norms on refugees' and migrants' rights. It has so far given every indication of being even more problematic in practice."" The EU has faced a barrage of criticism about the bargain it struck with Turkey at a summit in March. Turkey, already hosting 3.1 million refugees, agreed to take back irregular migrants from Europe, in exchange for an end to visa restrictions, as well as progress on EU accession talks. European leaders also promised to resettle up to 72,000 Syrian refugees living in Turkey and provide (EURO)3bn (£2.3bn) in humanitarian funding.  The European commission brushed aside the latest criticism as it published its first assessment of the EU-Turkey deal, which came into force one month ago.  Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner in charge of migration, said the situation in Greece had improved and claimed the Council of Europe was ""fully supportive"" of EU policy.  He insisted no refugees were being sent back from Turkey to Syria, dismissing on-the-ground reports from Amnesty International that the European parliament wants investigated.  Some MEPs fear the deal risks tarnishing Europe's moral authority further if EU officials fudge security and technical standards to meet Turkey's demand of visa-free travel for its 79 million citizens by June.  Gaining visa-free access to the EU's passport-free Schengen zone is one of the most valuable points for Turkey, but numerous hurdles have to be cleared. In the last two years, Ankara has met more than half of 72 EU benchmarks, including introducing security chips in passports, stepping up border controls and outlawing discrimination against minority groups.  Turkey has just 10 days to fulfil the remaining criteria if the EU is to grant visa-free travel by June.  Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, warned on Monday he might tear up the deal if the EU failed to deliver on visa-free travel. ""I maintain my belief that, God willing, we will have the visa exemption in June. In the absence of that, then of course no one can expect Turkey to adhere to its commitments,"" he said.  The European parliament and EU member states will have the final word on visa-free travel for Turkey, with a decision expected around the time of the UK's EU referendum. Although Turkish citizens would not gain visa-free access to Britain, which is outside Schengen, the issue has already been seized on by Brexit campaigners.  The commission insists it will not offer any shortcuts to visa-free travel, although some MEPs are less convinced.  Kati Piri, a Dutch MEP on the parliament's foreign affairs committee, said the EU must not lower standards on the visa requirements in the haste to strike a deal.  Visa-free travel in the Schengen zone ""has to be based on objective criteria and not on the fact that Turkey is threatening to blow up this deal if we don't give this now"", she said. A supporter of visa-free travel for Turks, she said the current ""highly political process"" could ""lead to disappointment for both sides"".  The MEP said the EU's desperation to strike a deal with Turkey had given Ankara the impression it was beyond reproach.  Last week the European parliament passed a motion criticising the Turkish government for ""significant backsliding"" on freedom of expression and assembly in locking up journalists and closing down newspapers.  For now, Brussels officials are content to hail the deal as a success, citing a sharp fall in people arriving on the Greek islands.  Around 3,500 people arrived on the Greek islands in the final 11 days of March, compared with 22,900 who came during the first part of the month before the deal was in force.  The EU border agency Frontex said fewer than 100 people a day were arriving on the Greek islands in early April, compared with around 2,000 a day at the start of the year. But rapid implementation has not been obvious on the EU side. So far only 103 Syrians out of the possible 72,000 have been resettled from Turkey into Europe under the one-for-one scheme. Only (EURO)187m of the EU's (EURO)3bn humanitarian aid cheque has been distributed. ""This is not the large-scale resettlement that the Turkish people are hoping for"" and the ""money is taking a long time to be disbursed"", said Piri.  ""People in Turkey are not silly; they see it is not a genuine commitment to Turkey and born out of necessity."" Asli Aydintasbas, visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the deal had another value for Turkey. ""For the longest time the Turkish government had been frozen out; for five or six years [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan had not been invited to Brussels and had a very tense relationship with the US. ""All of a sudden that is secondary - I don't want to say it is forgotten - but once again Turkey has a seat at the European table. ""That is the main value for the government in Ankara, a perceived sense of legitimacy on the international platform.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-04,0,Policy

Now food aid has run out they urgently need to step up the humanitarian response,"Western governments are tiring of Muslim wars. They are also tiring of their victims. The UN is reported to have run out of money to relieve the refugee tide now spreading across the Middle East. Some four million people are living in camps reliant on the UN's World Food Programme, not to mention other camps caused by wars in Sudan, Somalia and the Central African Federation. A million Syrians have fled to Lebanon and a million to Jordan, creating new desert cities of indolence and disease. Now the cash vouchers that supply liquidity to the camps and sustain food supplies are to end. Some £500m has been pumped into the Jordanian camps by the UN alone and money has run out. Food rations are to be cut and host governments, facing an apparently ceaseless human migration, are starting to close their borders. The means by which the world relieves such suffering are seizing up. In the past the UN has too often cried wolf to raise money from rich countries, but in this case it is hard to quarrel with the cause. We can argue all night over who is to blame. The US, Britain and Nato played a major part in disrupting the region, indulging in ""wars of choice"" in Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. For a decade they toppled regimes and either fought or backed insurgents with bombs and troops. Peace they did not bring. There was always money for military action. America spent $3tn fighting in Iraq. Britain spent £40bn on Afghanistan alone, under the obscene rubric of ""humanitarian intervention"". David Cameron yearned to go to war in Syria. Yet Britain's eagerness for war contrasts with an aversion to the consequences, whether frantic young Afghans in Calais camps, Libyans adrift in the Mediterranean or Iraqi translators desperate for asylum. Now the humanitarian chicken has come home to roost. Common decency demands a response. Even within its aid budget, Britain spends freely on corrupt governments, phony consultants and global warming projects. It has cash for glamour causes at home and abroad.

Lebanon has taken in 1,172,735 Syrian refugees, Jordan 629,128, Iraq 249,726 and Egypt 132,375. About 24,055 Syrians are refugees elsewhere in north Africa. The latest UN figures do not include the more than 270,000 Syrians applying for asylum in Europe, nor the thousands resettled from the region elsewhere. The milestone of four million comes just 10 months after the number of Syrian refugees hit three million, and the UN predicts there will be 4.27 million in the region by the end of this year. At the end of 2014, one in every five displaced people worldwide was Syrian. Despite being the world's single largest refugee crisis, the number of people fleeing is still far lower than the number of Afghans who were forced from their country following the Soviet withdrawal. According to the UNHCR, there were 6.3 million Afghans living in Pakistan and Iran in 1990. The sheer number of Syrian refugees that have fled the war in their homeland is putting the international humanitarian system under huge financial strain.  At the end of June, UN aid agencies warned that a $5.5bn (£3.6bn) appeal to tackle the Syrian refugee crisis this year was less than 25% funded, putting millions of vulnerable people at risk - a situation that has already led to cuts in vital assistance. Last week, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) warned once again that it was running out of money to feed the refugees and could be forced to cut all help for the hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Jordan as soon as next month. Muhannad Hadi, the WFP's regional director for the Middle East, north Africa, central Asia and eastern Europe, said: ""Just when we thought things couldn't get worse, we are forced yet again to make yet more cuts.  "" Refugees were already struggling to cope with what little we could provide."" According to the agencies and their partner organisations, the shortfall has meant 1.6 million refugees have already had food assistance cut this year and 750,000 children are not attending school.  Related: Young Syrian refugees give up hopes of education in Jordan | Sam Jones Most of Syria's refugees have no prospect of returning home in the near future amid a conflict that has become increasingly complex and intractable. In the north and north-east, Kurdish militias are fighting Islamic State in see-saw battles that continue to drive civilians across the border into Turkey. Turkey's reluctance to absorb more refugees often leaves people stranded for days at the border. In Aleppo and Daraa, two of Syria's largest cities, rebels fighting the regime of the president, Bashar al-Assad, have pressed on with offensives that have encountered stiff resistance from loyalist troops, stalling the attacks. But even if they were to seize the coveted territory, or begin an assault on the capital, Damascus, the country would be faced with the collapse of state institutions and services as the opposition attempts to manage a large metropolis such as Aleppo under unforgiving air strikes. The regime's collapse there would likely drive more refugees into neighbouring states, particularly Lebanon, where displaced Syrians already make up a fifth of the population, upsetting the delicate sectarian balance and stretching infrastructure past its breaking point. Lebanon has responded with increasingly stringent entry conditions. Assad's government and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah are fighting to secure the border region that straddles the two countries after a series of defeats that exposed the growing fragility of the Syrian army. A recent global trends study by the UNHCR found that the level of worldwide displacement is higher than ever before, with a record 59.5 million people living exiled from their homes at the end of 2014.  The UNHCR estimates that an average of 42,500 men, women and children became refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced people every day last year - a fourfold increase in just four years. By the end of last year, there were 19.5 million refugees - more than half of them children - as well as 38.2 million internally displaced people and 1.8 million asylum seekers. With war, violence and persecution leaving one in every 122 humans on the planet a refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum at the end of 2014, the UNHCR warned that the world was experiencing an "" age of unprecedented mass displacement"". Decades of displacement According to UNHCR, there were 6.3 million Afghans living in Pakistan and Iran in 1990 following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Bosnian war of 1992-1995 forced 2.7 million people to flee, making it it the largest displacement of people in Europe since the second world war. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, two million people fled to neighbouring countries. The refugees, who were mainly Hutus, sought refuge in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Tanzania, Burundi and Uganda. In 1999, more than 867,000 people fled the war in Kosovo, most of them heading to Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. The 2003 US invasion of Iraq and the violence that followed is estimated to have pushed about two million Iraqis into countries including Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon.",Broadsheet,0,2015-07,0,Migration

Nine experts appointed by the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon produced the report on humanitarian financing to inform talks at May's world humanitarian summit. Officials at the meeting will be tasked with devising ways to reinvigorate the aid system in a time of unprecedented displacement caused by multiple man-made and natural disasters.   Related: People hit by disaster want us to do much better, says humanitarian chief As well as providing concrete fundraising suggestions - including micro-levies on corporations, a voluntary solidarity tax, and increased use of Islamic funding such as zakat religious contributions and Islamic bonds - the experts had sharp words for a system often riven by ""turf wars"".  The world already spends roughly $25bn (£17.5bn) - 12 times more than it did in 2001 - to support the estimated 125 million people left destitute by war and natural disasters. But at least another $15bn is needed, the report's authors said. ""This is a lot of money, but not out of reach for a world producing $78tn of annual gross domestic product,"" wrote the high-level panel of experts, noting that the funds raised for humanitarian aid in 2014 amounted to just 0.031% of GDP. The European commissioner Kristalina Georgieva, who co-chaired the panel, told reporters in Brussels that the number of people in need had almost quadrupled since the beginning of the millennium. ""If they were a country ... this would be the 11th largest country in the world - just between Japan and Mexico - and people in this country would most of the time be scared for their lives ... They would be often out of their homes - 60 million of them, with an average duration of displacement being 17 years,"" she said. Should the needs of citizens of this ""invisible country"" remain unaddressed, the world will fail to achieve the sustainable development goals adopted at the UN last September, the report warned. Georgieva said fixing the aid system was possible: ""This is one problem that, if we muster the political will, we can solve. Why? Because not only is it morally right, but it is also in our own self-interest. We don't have to look further than Europe's refugee crisis to understand this."" The report focused on reducing humanitarian needs, raising more money and improving efficiency.  Global political leadership was identified as key to achieving the first of these goals, with the emphasis on preventing conflicts and increasing investment in disaster risk reduction. To this end, the report recommended that official development assistance should focus on fragile situations. The experts called for a threefold increase in funds for the International Development Association's crisis response window and an easing of eligibility criteria to allow middle-income countries to access grants and low-cost loans if needed. The experts also recommended that UN member states put 1% of core funding allocated to peace operations into the UN Peacebuilding Fund. They also advocated the creation of a voluntary solidarity levy at the May summit in Istanbul, although Georgieva said the panel was unable to agree on specifics. Some proposed an air ticket or gasoline levy, while others were ""dead against"" any tax. Georgieva, a Bulgarian national and former vice-president of the World Bank, said the panel had also looked at micro taxes on entertainment and travel. ""Here you have concerts, you have entertainment, movies, sport, potentially taxi rides,"" she said, adding that a working group should study the issue further before the summit.   Related: Syrian refugees: World Bank and UN urge major change in handling of crisis Businesses must play a bigger role in the humanitarian system, helping to manage risk and modernise transparency, while there should be greater use of social impact bonds, micro-levies on corporations and Islamic social finance.  ""If you take one of the Islamic financing platforms - this is zakat, mandatory giving - zakat is somewhere between $300bn and $500bn a year. Just 1% of zakat will go a long way to closing the $15bn gap,"" Georgieva said, adding that concrete products would be piloted to show how to tap into this funding stream.  To address inefficiencies, the panel proposed a ""grand bargain"" under which ""donors would not simply give more but give better, by being more flexible, and aid organisations would reciprocate with greater transparency and cost-consciousness"". This pact would also involve the use of more cash-based aid, give a greater role to local organisations, and prompt donors to give more long-term, predictable funding. ""Right now, we have 'competitive inefficiency',"" said Georgieva. ""Something happens and we are like eight-year-olds playing soccer - we are all chasing the ball."" The report praised the dedication of thousands of humanitarian workers but had sharp words for the ""wasteful"" competition between aid agencies for funds.  ""While the need for joint planning is often talked about, in reality every organisation is an island. 'Turf wars' are a common occurrence, with each organisation trying to position itself as the best implementer,"" it said. The study was to be presented to Ban in Dubai on Sunday; the location was deliberate, Georgieva said. ""Tragically this is the region that is now the example of people in need. Three out of every four appeals that exceed $1bn take place in the Middle East."" The experts stressed change was urgent. If current trends continue, by 2030, when the SDGs are due to expire, the cost of humanitarian assistance will have risen to $50bn and 62% of the world's poor could be living in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Despite the challenges, they said they were optimistic. ""The record sums being raised are a powerful signal that our collective humanity is a force to be reckoned with and can be harnessed to even greater effect. But we also need the political will to create change at scale.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-01,1,Aid

Our borough is now home to nine families and we hope to welcome more people throughout the year.  Yana, 20, fled Syria in 2013 when her brother was imprisoned and her house destroyed. The youngest of six siblings who have been scattered around the globe by the conflict, Yana has settled in well in Islington. She recently passed her first accountancy exams and her English has blossomed as she has made friends, including in a Red Cross-run choir she recently joined. Stories such as these are a testament to the contribution they've made to our community and evidence of a smooth transition into our borough.   Related: I work with child refugees in Calais. Theresa May's deception is a cruel act | Benny Hunter Yet issues remain that have made the process of resettlement harder than it needs to be, particularly the Home Office's insistence that those who have arrived under the government's Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) be granted five-year humanitarian protection visas instead of typical refugee status, which affords people the ability to travel and access to student finance as well as to some social security support. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to the families we have welcomed. As grantees of humanitarian protection, those who have arrived under the Syrian VPRS scheme are not entitled to a UN travel document. Instead, they must either use their own passport or apply for a certificate of travel. At £218 per person, this is unaffordable for many of those who only recently escaped a horrific civil war that is still ongoing. The matter is compounded by the fact that many countries - including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt - do not accept such a document or are very unlikely to. The Home Office has told us of a case in which at least one family obtained these documents only to be subsequently turned away as they attempted to travel. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to families  Kaya Comer-Schwarz  As for their own passports, of the nine Islington families, only three have valid Syrian documentation; one family's passports expire shortly. Many have close family - children, parents and siblings - in Europe and around Syria. To make matters worse, help with family reunion is now outside the scope of legal aid, like so many other issues. The inability to travel to see relatives is proving to be seriously distressing to these families. In some cases, it is preventing us from effectively supporting them to integrate. Late last year we urged the Home Office to reconsider this disparity between the two definitions. We are not alone in doing so: recently the Commons Public Accounts Committee made similar calls in its report on the VPRS scheme, pointing out that granting humanitarian protection rather than refugee status risked people missing out on access to some public services It would greatly assist us in providing the best support to families, without incurring additional costs, if refugee status were granted through a fast-track process set up in consultation with experts on asylum law and policy.

In a major policy speech on Europe's worst migration emergency, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, is to table proposals next Wednesday for the mandatory sharing of 160,000 refugees between 25 of the EU's 28 countries.  Related: Cameron bows to pressure to allow more Syrian refugees into Britain Britain, Ireland and Denmark are exempted from having to take part, but Dublin has already agreed to participate and David Cameron is under increasing pressure for Britain to pull its weight as the migration crisis escalates with scenes of chaos and misery on Europe's borders. Berlin and Paris have sought to maintain a common position for weeks, but the French equivocated on the key issue of binding quotas. On Thursday, the president, François Hollande, aligned himself with Merkel's drive for compulsory EU sharing of refugees. Merkel announced from Switzerland that both sides had agreed a common platform and Hollande said there should be a ""permanent and obligatory mechanism"" for receiving refugees in the EU. ""The president and the chancellor have today decided to forward joint proposals on the organisation of the reception of refugees and a fair sharing in Europe,"" said the Élysée Palace. Germany, along with the European commission, has been pushing hard for a new mandatory system since May when Juncker tabled much more modest proposals for the compulsory sharing of 40,000 bona fide asylum-seekers over two years. A summit of EU leaders in June rejected the quotas, saying they could only be voluntary and eventually agreeing to share only 32,000. The east European countries and Spain were the main opponents. Four east European prime ministers are to meet on Friday to consider their positions. Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, reiterated his opposition to quotas in Berlin this week. But the speed of developments on the ground is dictating political responses. Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits as president of the European council, said the EU should agree to share at least 100,000 refugees. In June, he opposed the quotas system. The proposed figures - 100,000 to 160,000 - refer merely to a mandatory quotas system, beyond the much higher numbers of asylum claims that the countries will have to process in any case. Germany alone expects 800,000 this year.  Related: Migration crisis: Hungary PM says Europe in grip of madness There is certain to be a fight over the new policy when EU interior ministers hold an extraordinary session on the migration crisis on 14 September.  In Brussels on Thursday, Hungary's hardline anti-immigrant prime minister, Viktor Orban, said quotas would only encourage more people to head for Europe from the Middle East and Africa. ""Quotas is an invitation for those who want to come,"" he said. ""The moral human thing is to make clear, please don't come."" But the east Europeans are under intense pressure to fall in with the German line and already Poland and Lithuania are making concessions. There were pitiful scenes in Hungary where migrants thronged Budapest's main railway station and packed into a train they believed was going to Austria en route to Germany, which has opened its doors unconditionally to refugees from Syria. The train was halted 30km out of Budapest and met by a phalanx of riot police who sought to empty the carriages and march the people to a camp. The Hungarian leader, widely criticised for his anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric, went on the offensive in Brussels. He said Europe was in the grip of madness over immigration and refugees and argued that he was defending European Christianity against a Muslim influx. ""Everything which is now taking place before our eyes threatens to have explosive consequences for the whole of Europe,"" Orban wrote in Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""Europe's response is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union's misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation. Irresponsibility is the mark of every European politician who holds out the promise of a better life to immigrants and encourages them to leave everything behind and risk their lives in setting out for Europe."" He painted the refugee emergency as a crisis between Christianity and Islam, with Hungary on the frontline, erecting razor wire fences to keep people out and defend European civilisation against incomers.  Related: Germany and France demand binding refugee quotas for EU members ""Those arriving have been raised in another religion and represent a radically different culture.

The impact of Syria's refugee crisis on the Middle East has been immense. Turkey hosts more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, Lebanon is home to 1.1 million, and Jordan has registered nearly 620,000, the UNHCR said. Iraq hosts 232,800 Syrian refugees and Egypt close to 136,000. These five countries host 97% of Syria's refugees, according to Amnesty International. About 80,000 Syrians live in Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp, making it the country's fourth largest city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a credible source inside the country, estimates that 210,000 people have died in the conflict. About 6.5 million Syrians have been displaced within the country, according to the Migration Policy Centre. Syrian refugees now comprise 26% of Lebanon's total population, placing a strain on humanitarian resources. Political pressure to stem the flow of new arrivals led Lebanon to impose strict entry requirements on Syrians at the end of last year, raising concerns that more displaced people will remain in danger inside the country as fighting continues. Syrians fleeing the civil war are also streaming across European borders. European law requires people to be physically present in the country they are petitioning for asylum. This has sparked a boom in illegal migration across the Mediterranean. About 218,000 Syrian refugees had applied for asylum in EU countries as of December 2014, according to the UNHCR. Germany and Sweden fielded nearly half of all asylum requests. The UNHCR's data does not include internally displaced people or those who have not registered at a recognised refugee camp. Refugees are defined by the UNHCR as those with a legitimate fear of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, or affiliation with a social or political group, and who are outside their country of origin. Asylum seekers are people whose claims of persecution have not yet been substantiated.  According to the 1951 refugee convention, which was amended in 1967, ""refugees deserve, as a minimum, the same standards of treatment enjoyed by other foreign nationals in a given country and, in many cases, the same treatment as nationals"".

Any refugees arriving in Greece can now expect to be sent back to Turkey if they do not apply for asylum or if their claim is rejected.  The deal between the EU and Turkey, struck on Friday, has been criticised by aid agencies as inhumane. The UN's refugee agency said big questions remained about how the deal would work in practice and called for urgent improvements to Greece's system for assessing refugees.  Related: Syrian refugees still aim for Europe as leaders finalise EU-Turkey deal Thousands of refugees who arrived in Greece before the deadline will be resettled in Europe, although they cannot choose where. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, urged refugees at Idomeni to move to other accommodation being offered by the Greek authorities. Some 14,000 people are waiting at the border village in the hope of travelling north.  ""I want to take the opportunity to tell the refugees at Idomeni that they should trust the Greek government and move to other accommodation where the conditions will be significantly better,"" Merkel said. She added that ""from there, Greece will put asylum procedures in motion or redistribution to other European countries will take place"".  In exchange for taking in refugees, Turkey can expect ""re-energised"" talks on its EU membership, with the promise of negotiations on one policy area to be opened before July. Although this is a climbdown by Turkey, after Cyprus blocked a more ambitious restart of accession talks, Davutoglu said it was ""a historic day"" for EU-Turkey relations.  But the head of the UN high commissioner for human rights in Europe raised concerns that safeguards intended to protect vulnerable asylum seekers would not be in place in time. Vincent Cochetel, director of the UNHCR for Europe, said the agreement was legal on paper, but questions remained on how it was implemented. ""For us the proof is in the pudding. Clearly the deal on paper is consistent with international law and standards. The worry is that the safeguards will not be in place on 20 March.""  People claiming asylum needed access to interpreters and the right of appeal, he said, vital elements of a functioning asylum system that Greece has struggled to put in place until now. Implementation ""is a big question mark, it is a big challenge"". Aid agencies accused the EU of failing to respect the spirit of EU and international laws. ""This is a dark day for the refugee convention, a dark day for Europe and a dark day for humanity,"" said Kate Allen of Amnesty International. Action Aid's Mike Noyes claimed the deal would ""effectively turn the Greek islands... into prison camps where terrified people are held against their will before being deported back to Turkey"". Facing criticism that Turkey is not a safe third country, Davutoglu defended his country's record in sheltering 2.8 million refugees. Those who criticise Turkey ""have to provide us with a better option"", he said.  Related: Refugee crisis: What does the EU's deal with Turkey mean? The controversial one-for-one deal remains intact: for every Syrian refugee that the EU sends back across the Aegean, a Syrian in Turkey will be given a new home in Europe. But a cap of 72,000 places has been put on Syrians who will be given asylum in Europe, far short of the 108,000 a year recommended by international aid agencies, if the EU is to do its fair share. The scheme will be stopped once more than 72,000 people have been settled in Europe, amid concerns among some countries of an ""open-ended commitment"".  The deal was agreed despite lacerating criticism from Turkey's president, who attacked Europe's ""shameful"" record on refugees as the summit got underway. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was not taking part in the Brussels talks, said Europe should look at its own record on refugees before telling Turkey what to do. ""At a time when Turkey is hosting 3 million, those who are unable to find space for a handful of refugees, who in the middle of Europe keep these innocents in shameful conditions, must first to look at themselves,"" Erdogan told Turkish television. Approximately 45,000 people are trapped in Greece, including 14,000 who are living in squalid conditions near the Greek-Macedonian border at Idomeni, as they are barred from travelling onwards to central and northern Europe. Erdogan, who last year threatened to send millions of refugees to Europe on buses and planes, has been frozen out by the EU hierarchy for almost a decade over concerns about his record on human rights and press freedom. In a speech where he criticised the EU for backing Kurdish rebels, Erdogan also warned that European cities faced repeated terror attacks that have struck Turkey in recent months, some of which have been claimed by Kurdish fighters and others blamed on Islamic State. ""Despite this clear reality, European countries are paying no attention, as if dancing on a minefield.""  Davutoglu, a more emollient figure, was despatched to Brussels to finalise a refugee pact. He secured a promise from the EU to speed up the disbursement of (EURO)3bn (£2.3bn) intended to help Syrian refugees in Turkey, with new projects to be agreed this week. Turkey has pledged that all returned people will be treated in line with international law, including guarantees that they will not be returned to the countries they have fled from. On Turkey's most prized objective of easing visa restrictions, Davutoglu was confident this could be done by Ankara's preferred end of June deadline, although his government has only met half of the EU's 72 bureaucratic conditions. Anyone making an asylum claim in Greece would be guaranteed a personal interview and the right of appeal. In theory, this would allow asylum seekers, for example Kurds, to make a case for not being sent back to Turkey. Athens and EU authorities will have to build a functioning asylum system in Greece within days. About 4,000 extra staff - judges, case officers, border guards and translators - will need to be sent from across the EU to the Greek islands to ensure claims can be processed at an estimated cost of up to (EURO)300m. ""Greece is faced by a herculean task, it is the largest challenge the EU has yet faced,"" said the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The returns programme will not apply to the 45,000 refugees and migrants now in Greece, who can expect to be relocated to other countries in the EU, if they are deemed to have a valid asylum claim.  EU officials expressed confidence that a target of resettling 6,000 refugees a month around the bloc was possible, despite laggardly progress on existing schemes. ""We expect we will be able to reach this number because member states at this meeting and previous meetings have promised to step up their efforts,"" Juncker said. But the scale of the task is underscored by slow progress on existing schemes: a plan to relocate 160,000 refugees from Greece and Italy to other EU countries has led to fewer than 1,000 finding new homes.",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,0,Policy

In a landmark case, the appeals committee authority upheld the appeal of an asylum seeker who had been one of the first Syrians listed for deportation under the terms of the EU-Turkey deal. In a document seen by the Guardian, a three-person appeals committee said Turkey would not give Syrian refugees the rights they were owed under international treaties and therefore overturned the applicant's deportation order by a verdict of two to one. The case will now be re-assessed from scratch. The committee's conclusion stated: ""The committee has judged that the temporary protection which could be offered by Turkey to the applicant, as a Syrian citizen, does not offer him rights equivalent to those required by the Geneva convention.""  Related: From war in Syria to a Turkish sweatshop for child refugees The decision undermines the legal and practical basis for the EU-Turkey deal, which European leaders had hoped would deter refugees from sailing to Europe by ensuring the swift deportation of most people landing on the Greek islands. After signing the deal on 18 March, EU officials claimed these deportations would be legally justified on the basis that Turkey respects refugee rights.  But the EU's executive has little control over Greek asylum protocols. The committee rejected the logic of the EU-Turkey deal, citing some of the EU's own previous directives as explanations for their decision.  While nearly 400 other asylum seekers have been returned to Turkey under the terms of the deal, no one of Syrian nationality had been sent back against their will - making Friday's decision a watershed moment. ""At its very first test, the EU-Turkey deal crumbles,"" said Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International's deputy Europe director. The Greek government, which played no part in the independent decision, admitted the judgment had created ""a very difficult situation"". Greece's deputy minister in charge of migration policy, Yannis Mouzalas, said by phone from Brussels: ""I have only just learned of the decision by the appeals committee and I have to be in Greece to study it. They are, as you know, independent committees so it is very difficult for me to say anything - but if they think this way, we will have a very difficult situation.""  Such a decision goes against all the directives of the UN and UNHCR, Mouzalas claimed. ""Really I don't know how they arrived at it.""  UNHCR offered no immediate response, but has previously criticised the EU-Turkey deal, and resolved to play no part in it. Greek media said it would be only a matter of time before the ""bombshell"" decision had the snowball effect of triggering an avalanche of similar asylum requests by other refugees, especially Syrians, detained on far-flung Aegean islands. Some 174 claims have been examined by appeals committees made up of asylum experts, lawyers and officials in Lesbos so far, with 100 being upheld, according to the Greek daily Kathimerini.  Government figures released on Friday showed 8,592 migrants and refugees were currently being held on the islands, often in squalid conditions.  Related: Syrians returned to Turkey under EU deal 'have had no access to lawyers' The increased prospect of being allowed to stay in Greece, rather than being returned to Syria, could also spark a renewed wave of migration from Turkey. Deterred by the deal and by increased Turkish border protection, migrant numbers have dwindled significantly since the deal was announced. Human rights groups were quick to welcome the news. ""We've always said Turkey is not a safe country for refugees because it has not fully signed up to the Geneva convention and to the social and judicial status of refugees, especially those who are not Syrians,"" said Wenzel Michalski, who as Germany director of Human Rights Watch watched the first forced returns of migrants from Lesbos to Turkey in April. Pledges by Turkey to improve labour market regulations by facilitating work permits for refugees had not been delivered, nor had promises to install refugee children in the education system, he said. Even worse was evidence of push-backs at the Turkish-Syrian border where would-be refugees had been deliberately shot at and killed - claims denied by the Turkish government. ""There are still lots of children who work instead of going to school and even worse, we still don't really know about the fate of those deported so far, as NGOs and journalists have been denied access to refugee camps and the first thing Turkish authorities did was to confiscate their smartphones,"" he said from Berlin. ""We have to say: 'Greece, thank you,' because this is a wonderful move."" ",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,0,Policy

Earlier this month, the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced that Australia would make 12,000 extra permanent humanitarian visa places available for Syrians and Iraqis fleeing the conflict in the Middle East. Families and persecuted minorities registered through the United Nations' refugee agency, the UNHCR, would be given first preference. On Thursday, Dutton announced that Australian officials working with the UNHCR have started processing the first group.

In an attempt to breathe new life into the EU's blue-card scheme - a work permit programme modelled on the US green card but which has not enjoyed the same success - the European commission said it wanted to open it up to people who were not EU nationals but had an offer of a job paying an average salary. Currently, blue cards are only given to non-EU nationals who will earn one and half times the average wage in the EU country where they plan to move. The proposals, which do not apply to the UK, Ireland or Denmark, are a way of trying to boost the ""insufficiently attractive and underused"" programme, under which fewer than 14,000 blue cards were granted in 2014, most of them by Germany.   Related: David Cameron challenged to EU referendum TV debate ""The revised EU blue card scheme will make it easier and more attractive for highly skilled third-country nationals to come and work in the EU and strengthen our economic growth,"" said Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner in charge of migration. The commission also said on Tuesday it hoped to offer poorer countries in Africa and the Middle East (EURO)62bn (£48bn) in exchange for stemming migrant flows, a plan that could see the EU making deals with some repressive regimes. Although the UK has stood on the sidelines of Europe's refugee crisis and does not take part in the blue card scheme, the leave campaign seized on both proposals ahead of Britain's EU referendum on 23 June.  ""It is an unholy mess,"" said the Labour MP Gisela Stuart. ""The plan appears to be to open our borders ever wider - extending access to the European labour market to the yet more war zones [sic].""  Janice Atkinson, a former Ukip MEP who is now an independent, said: ""The essence of the migration compact is the eagerness of the EU to hand more taxpayers' money to African despots to stop the migrants coming to Europe."" The changes to the blue card programme - which include cutting the maximum application processing time from 90 to 60 days - will have to be agreed by EU member states. Pierre Vimont, a former head of Europe's diplomatic service, told the Guardian recently that the EU would have to find ways to promote legal migration, as people from north African countries would continue to make their way to Europe. ""Some say not enough jobs in Europe,"" he said. ""But the pressure will still be there and those economic migrants will try to find ways of moving into Europe so we have to be prepared to face that challenge in the months and years ahead.""  Related: EU fact check: so who's right, David Cameron or the leave campaigners? In an attempt to stem the flow of refugees and migrants, the EU struck a controversial deal with Turkey in March which has seen the number of people attempting to reach Europe via the Aegean fall by 95%, according to the UN refugee agency. The European commission said on Tuesday it wanted to reach migration ""compacts"" with 16 countries in Africa and the Middle East, with the aim of preventing people from making perilous sea crossings. The commission hoped to use (EURO)3.1bn from the EU budget to encourage further contributions from private investors and member states.  It wanted to offer ""priority countries"" in Africa, the Middle East and Asia a mix of sticks and carrots to cajole them to do more to prevent people migrating to Europe.  Although the numbers attempting the Aegean route have dropped, the flow of people crossing the western Mediterranean to Italy continues unabated: about 46,000 arrived in Italy during the first five months of 2016 and at least 880 people have died in a spate of shipwrecks and capsizings, according to the UNHCR. The EU hopes to finalise deals in the coming weeks with Jordan and Lebanon, who are taking in a large number of Syrian refugees. Tunisia, Nigeria and Senegal are next in line, while other priority countries include Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Related: More than 700 migrants feared dead in three Mediterranean sinkings As the Guardian reported, the plan includes the EU's ""Better Migration Management"" project, a (EURO)46m plan targeted at countries in the Horn of Africa, including Sudan and Eritrea. Documents that came to light last December suggested this plan could involve sending cars, cameras and possibly aircraft to the Sudanese government, as well as training for Eritrean judges, whom the UN accuses of aiding and abetting President Isaias Afwerki's despotic regime in Asmara.  The commission has said there are no plans to send equipment to Sudan ""at this stage"".  The EU executive said it would like to offer African and Middle Eastern countries a share of (EURO)62bn, but was relying on private investors and EU member states to put up the bulk of the money. Around (EURO)3.1bn from the EU budget has been earmarked to fund loan guarantees and trigger development bank lending to take the sum to (EURO)31bn. The rest would come from voluntary contributions from EU member states.  African and Middle Eastern countries would only get these funds by meeting the EU's migration goals. Strings could also be attached to development aid, trade and other policies. A paper published on Tuesday made clear that nothing was off the table. ""No policy areas should be exempted from this approach. All EU policies including education, research, climate change, energy, environment, agriculture, should in principle be part of a package, bringing maximum leverage to the discussion."" Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the proposal amounted to ""a Copernican revolution"" in the use of Europe's foreign policy budget. She predicted a boost to prosperity across Africa as a result: ""[It is] a proposal that tackles migratory flows that also constitutes an opportunity for development for an entire continent,"" she said. ""There could be significant consequences for European stability as a consequence."" But sceptics said the plans could promote the misuse of EU development aid. ""Developing countries could receive funds intended for development aid to tighten their borders,"" said Judith Sargentini, a Dutch MEP in the European parliament's Green group. ""Much-needed funds for the poor are thus being misused and, as a result, the commission's proposals fail to deal with the actual reasons why people migrate in the first place."" She said the proposals meant ""the outsourcing of the EU's responsibilities to countries where basic protection of human rights is not guaranteed"", naming Eritrea and Somalia. Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Liberal group in the European parliament, said: ""The best way to fight human traffickers is to create a legal way for people to come to Europe. The proposal for the revision of the blue card is certainly an improvement compared to the current system; but that was not so difficult. The commission proposal will in reality keep 28 national systems in place, while we need one simple system.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-06,1,Policy

The prime minister announced that the Royal Navy was deploying the amphibious landing ship RFA Mounts Bay as the first UK contribution to the Nato deployment in the Aegean Sea. The vessel, which carries a Wildcat helicopter, will join naval vessels from Germany, Canada, Turkey and Greece as part of Nato's first intervention in the migration crisis.   Related: Migration crisis summit: EU and Turkish leaders meet in Brussels - live The announcement came several hours after another boat carrying people sank with the loss of 25 lives including at least three children. Fifteen people were rescued after the boat capsized near the Turkish resort of Didim. It comes as European leaders come under increasing political pressure at home to stem the flow of refugees and migrants.  Turkey hosts more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees, and has warned that tens of thousands more who have fled a Syrian government advance on Aleppo were seeking to join them. Greece, as the first point of entry for most people seeking asylum in Europe, is under concerted pressure from European governments to do much more to halt the influx of refugees and migrants from Turkey.  The buildup of refugees in Greece escalated on Sunday as regional officials spoke of a humanitarian crisis on the country's northern border where 14,000 men, women and children were estimated to be trapped as a result of Macedonia sealing the frontier.  As the EU's chief immigration policymaker, Dimitris Avramopoulos, predicted some 100,000 migrants and refugees would reach the country this month alone, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras's leftist-led government demanded Europe share the burden of handling the crisis. About 3,000 people are landing on Greek shores from Turkey every day, officials say. ""Europe is in the midst of a nervous crisis, primarily for reasons of political weakness,"" Tsipras told top officials in his Syriza party on Sunday. He slammed the decision of eastern European and Balkan states to tighten restrictions, a move that by Monday morning the Greek government said had left a total 36,419 people stranded in Greece.  The UK ship set to join the effort in the Aegean is expected to start operations in the coming days. It will spot smugglers taking migrants to Greece and pass information to Turkish coastguards so they can be intercepted. Two Border Force cutters will also join the operation, along with a third boat - the chartered civilian vessel VOS Grace - which is already in the Aegean.   They will be under the command of the German-led Nato patrol which sent three warships to the area three weeks ago in a rapid deployment.  In a statement, Cameron said: ""We've got to break the business model of the criminal smugglers and stop the desperate flow of people crammed into makeshift vessels from embarking on a fruitless and perilous journey. That's why this Nato mission is so important. It's an opportunity to stop the smugglers and send out a clear message to migrants contemplating journeys to Europe that they will be turned back. That's why the UK is providing vital military assets to work with our European partners and support this mission.""   Greece and Turkey have agreed that any people they intercept will be sent back.   Cameron will on Monday join counterparts from European Union nations and Turkey at an emergency summit in Brussels.  The EU executive has announced the first payouts from a £2.3bn fund meant to help Turkey cope with the influx of refugees.  Agency reports have claimed that EU leaders will urge Turkey to agree to ""large scale"" deportations of 100,000 ""economic migrants"" from Greece.  The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, will be pressed to take back migrants who do not qualify as refugees.  Meanwhile, Greek police officials said Macedonian authorities are only allowing those from cities they consider to be affected by war to cross the border from Greece. That means people from cities such as Aleppo in Syria, for example, can enter, but those from Syria's capital Damascus or the Iraqi capital Baghdad are being stopped. There have been concerns that a strong naval presence in the Aegean might encourage more people to attempt to reach Europe, as there would be a greater chance of being picked up in the event of boats sinking.   Related: 'Do not come to Europe,' Donald Tusk warns economic migrants More than 400 people have died so far this year trying to cross the sea to Europe and nearly 10 times as many refugees and migrants crossed in the first six weeks of 2016 compared with the same period last year. In the UK, Cameron is facing pressure from one of his backbenchers and the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, about the prospect of Turkey joining the EU.  David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, highlighted concerns raised by Europol that more than 5,000 EU nationals have been radicalised by fighting with Muslim extremists in Iraq and Syria. He claimed many have returned home, warning that admitting Turkey could make the problem worse.  ""Giving visa-free access to people carrying Turkish papers will, if anything, make worse the security threat identified by Europol.

The horror of that image has done more than move public sentiment. It has shamed policymakers into considering the humanitarian catastrophe that is the predictable outcome of inaction.""  That was the opening paragraph in the Times's leading article today (Monday), referring to the image of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, echoed views expressed in the Sunday national press. The result of the shaming was heralded in the vow by chancellor George Osborne to use £1bn from overseas aid budget to fund housing and living costs of extra refugees. And its practical expression will be clearer still when prime minister David Cameron later announces how many Syrian refugees will be given sanctuary in Britain. The refugee crisis, and the government's response to it, opened up several separate debates explored in Monday's national newspapers. Is it appropriate to use the foreign aid budget? What does the crisis say about Britain's relationship with the European Union? Should Britain launch military strikes in Syria? The Daily Mail, saying it had "" long been critical of the decision to spend an arbitrary 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid "", greeted Osborne's decision to spend some of the money ""at home"" by ""providing support to the 'thousands' of Syrian asylum seekers the UK has pledged to take direct from refugee camps bordering Syria."" The Daily Telegraph's leading article, "" Challenges for MPs in Europe and Syria "", viewed the coming referendum on EU membership, ""the unfolding migration crisis"" in Europe, the government's asylum policy and the conflict in the Middle East as ""interlinked"" issues. It said:  ""The prime minister is right to resist pressure to take a share of the non-EU refugees now in Germany and other member states. If he were forced to relinquish Britain's opt-out from Europe's asylum relocation policy how could he secure any changes to the free movement of people within the EU itself?""  The Telegraph argued that the UK was pursuing an ""incoherent policy towards Syria"" by ""bombing the jihadists in Iraq but not in Syria"" but believed ""British attacks on Isil in Syria will arguably make little difference."" It continued:  ""The air forces from half a dozen countries are already in action over Syria to little avail. Despite the hopes of Lord Carey, the former archbishop of Canterbury, that British raids in Syria would 'help destroy Isil', doing so will take a far greater effort than we have seen so far. Meanwhile, Russia is establishing a base inside Syria from which to attack the jihadist movement and yet is being criticised for making matters worse. This is because Moscow sees a future role for Syria's President Assad while the West doesn't. Barack Obama appears to have given up trying to resolve this impasse; but until it is resolved, there is no prospect of the civil war ending, or of Isil being defeated, or of the refugee crisis abating.""  Other newspapers rattled sabres. None more so than the Sun, which ran a spread headlined "" Blitz 'em to hell: Our Boys await order to destroy IS in Syria."" The Sun's article rested on a statement by the British Army's former chief of staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, about there being a lack of logic in taking action against Isis in Iraq and not in Syria. It began:  ""The Sun today lays out the military options open to David Cameron for air strikes on Syria to ease the migrant crisis... Our Boys and Girls could strike a death blow to the heart of IS and relieve pressure on innocent civilians, if given the go-ahead by MPs.""  The paper went so far as to explain its favoured military tactics:  ""If the order was given, Astute class attack submarines using Tomahawk missiles could wipe out IS HQs in the city of Raqqah. This could be followed by precision bombing strikes involving RAF Tornado jets. The RAF's fleet of fearsome Reaper drones could also have their mission extended into Syria. Armed with Hellfire missiles they can destroy armoured vehicles and teams of IS fighters from a height of thousands of feet. The US is already bombing IS targets in Syria but more firepower from Britain could tip the balance.""  The Daily Express, in a leader headlined "" The UK must intervene to stop slaughter in Syria "", agreed.  ""As... the migration crisis in Europe grows ever more acute it is plain that the west is going to have to act. That benighted country [Syria] has turned into a hell on earth and if we are really going to live up to humanitarian ideals then the only way we will have any success at all in relieving this tidal wave of human suffering is to take part in air strikes on IS. It is the only option. There is no point at all in trying to negotiate with these people: they are deranged fanatics intent only on spreading terror and bloodshed across the land. And the sooner we strike the better... If we got rid of IS and helped return some stability to Syria then that would be a start to tackling the migrant crisis.""  The Times, in contending that the nightmarish scenes of refugees in flight from Syria originate in the assault by Bashar al-Assad's "" criminal regime on a captive population "", did not specifically call for strikes. But it did condemn the previous failure to act. It said:  ""Two years ago the house of commons voted against considering military strikes on Assad's forces. It was, at very best, a myopic refusal to recognise a constant of military conflict. A decision for non-intervention does not mean that nothing happens: it means that something else happens, in this case the depredations committed by Syrian forces and Islamist extremists, with a desperate people caught between. A rogue state under Assad has become a failed state, whose map is changing almost daily and whose neighbours are attempting to exert their own spheres of influence. No ultimate solution to this disaster can be reached while Assad holds on and believes he can triumph through bloodshed. The ideal course will be to create conditions in which Syrians can return to their homes. Yet in the meantime, a moral duty of care is owed to suffering humanity.""  But the Daily Mirror was unequivocally against military action. ""Don't lead us into war"", it said, claiming that it was Downing Street ""banging the drums of war."" It pointed to the ""magnificent public response"" by Britons who support the people fleeing persecution, seeing it as ""a stinging rebuke to the shouty racists and xenophobes who callously turn their backs on the suffering of the less fortunate."" But it believed Cameron would be ""mistaken"" to confuse this support for refugees with ""permission to launch military action in Syria."" It concluded:  ""It still rankles with the PM that he was prevented from attacking President Assad, Islamic State's enemy, two years ago. Today he's straining to attack Islamic State, President Assad's enemy... There is, sadly, no simple answer to the conflict in Syria. Cameron should reflect on that before blundering into another war.""   The Sun's editorial took aim at the Labour leadership candidates for opposing air strikes (in Jeremy Corbyn's case), for being ""so spineless"" as to sit on the fence (Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall), or for staying silent (Andy Burnham). It called the quartet ""cowards"" and ""political pygmies"" while calling on ""decent, mainstream Labour MPs"" to ""vote with their consciences and back David Cameron."" The Guardian's leading article came at the issue from a very different angle by contending that Europe should take a stand against Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who "" has set himself up as a bulwark against a generous-spirited, pan-European approach."" It pointed to the ""dismal scenes"" in Budapest as an indictment of the Orbán government's callousness in contrast to Hungarian volunteers who have distributed aid to refugees in their capital. Orbán ""has trampled on democratic principles... been consistently provocative towards EU institutions, and made shows of solidarity with Vladimir Putin that have undermined EU efforts to make a strong stand on the war in Ukraine."" The Guardian said: ""Now, with the refugee crisis, the 'Orbán problem' is clear for all to see."" But the paper recognised that Orbán's extreme anti-migrant policies ""enjoy support among other central European governments"" such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It continued:  ""The 'Orbán factor' thus plays an important role in the east-west split that could define upcoming EU summits. The xenophobic narrative coming out of Hungary needs to be tackled head-on, before it encourages more chauvinism elsewhere in Europe... EU institutions have failed in the past to hold him accountable for trampling on Europe's values - now is the time to do so.""

The European Commission is to produce new policy blueprints on migration by May amid a growing realisation that radical action is needed to tackle the humanitarian tragedy that sees thousands of migrants drown each year in the Mediterranean. Sutherland has been working to get migration into the sustainable development goals (SDGs) that are being drafted now to guide development priorities until 2030. He said there might be some opposition, but he expected the issue to be referred to in a significant way. ""For a long time in the development community, there was a mental reaction that if we accept migration as being part of the development conundrum, we are conceding defeat... It's complete rubbish. [Migrants] make an enormous contribution... Remittances are far bigger than export growth and foreign direct investment. It's huge but everyone ignores it."" The European policy review was triggered after more than 300 people drowned off the Italian island of Lampedusa in October 2013. Sutherland, who was appointed the UN secretary general's special representative on migration in 2006, said politicians were too scared to discuss migration in an honest, constructive way.   Related: Asylum requests to rich countries at highest point for almost 25 years ""In some political environments, it's considered politically negative to mention the word 'migration' - so it's hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil...The result is that nobody explains, for example, that the total number of migrants is far less than the popular perception,"" he said. ""Why don't they? They don't because if a politician stands up and says, 'Look, we have far less migrants than you actually think we have', then that politician is branded, and so is his party, or that's the fear, with being pro-migrant and it's considered to be a negative,"" he said. ""The conjuncture between migration as an issue, and nationalism and anti-Europeanism is creating a toxic backdrop for an already difficult economic climate in Europe, and this is leading to the growth of movements like Ukip, Le Pen and Geert Wilders and so on across Europe,"" he added, referring to Britain's Ukip party, Marine Le Pen, leader of France's Front National, and Dutch politician Geert Wilders - all of whom are vehemently anti-immigrant. Sutherland said this toxic backdrop led to ""xenophobic and sometimes racist attacks"" on migrants, and contributed to the absence of a coherent and realistic debate about the positive fiscal and financial contributions made by many migrants. So far, leaks from discussions on the new policy blueprints reveal measures aimed at stopping people from boarding unseaworthy boats manned by unscrupulous smugglers to cross the Mediterranean.  Last year, at least 218,000 people, including migrants and refugees, crossed the Mediterranean by irregular routes and around 3,500 people drowned. On the table is an Italian proposal to outsource sea patrols to North African countries, such as Egypt and Tunisia, by funding and training navies. There are also proposals to establish ""reception centres"" for migrants in North Africa and the Middle East.  Sutherland, who was dubbed the ""father of globalisation"" during his time as director of the World Trade Organisation, said locating reception centres in North Africa or the Middle East could raise some problems but the advantages were significant. ""How many deaths would be avoided? It's not simply an issue... of pushing away the problem. If the processing can take place in North Africa, it's better because it would save lives,"" he said. But Ska Keller, a leading German Greens MEP and spokesperson on migration issues, has said called the proposal on sea patrols ""cynical"", as it would mean that ""rescued refugees are dealt with by countries like Egypt and Tunisia and that they never become the responsibility of an EU jurisdiction"". Sutherland sharply criticised EU states for failing to support Italy's Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation, which was replaced this year by the more limited Triton, which patrols no further than 30 miles from Italy's coast.  ""Where are the British ships? Who else is doing it? The Italians were left to do it on their own and nobody was prepared to even financially help them. Let's grow up,"" Sutherland said. In February, the UN refugee agency said around 300 migrants and refugees, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, may have drowned trying to cross from Libya to Europe in one weekend. ""There can be no doubt left after this week's events that Europe's Operation Triton is a woefully inadequate replacement for Italy's Mare Nostrum,"" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres. ""The focus has to be about saving lives. We need a robust search and rescue operation in the Central Mediterranean, not only a border patrol.""  Amnesty International has also called for an EU-wide mission with at least the same mandate and resources as Mare Nostrum, which saved more than 170,000 lives. ""We have to unite in our response to this in Europe,"" said Sutherland. ""We have to have... a far more proactive policy development at national level where much of the responsibility is left in the hands of home affairs or justice ministries... All they think about is stopping people coming in rather than the problem of how to treat them when they do come in.""  The UN has drawn up radical plans for an ""orderly relocation"" of thousands of Syrian refugees from southern Europe to richer countries in the north, and is pressing the EU to agree to a year-long pilot programme. ""I think that is important because if you have a temporary settlement you create a capacity to relate to the society,"" said Sutherland. While the complex issue of migration could not be addressed by ""waving a policy wand"", measures could be taken, such as offering temporary protection visas to asylum seekers to allow them to work while their cases were assessed, Sutherland said. And, above all, lives must be saved as an immediate priority. ""We saw what was done with Mare Nostrum... Why can't we have a situation where Triton is given resources? This is urgent. And it's going to lead to internal unrest in Europe unless it is handled,"" he said.",Broadsheet,0,2015-03,1,Policy

The plans, which are set to be announced in March, will raise the temperature of the UK's EU referendum campaign, even if the British government chooses to opt out.  Although the UK is not a member of the EU's border-free travel Schengen zone, it can choose to opt into EU asylum policy, meaning any changes will play into the highly charged campaign on Britain's future in Europe.  The UK takes part in the so-called Dublin system, which means refugees must remain in the first country they arrive in.  A European commission spokeswoman said there were ""systemic deficiencies in the way the current Dublin system is working"", and added the UK would have to decide whether to take part in the new rules.   Related: Pressure to resolve migration crisis could tear EU apart ""The UK would then have to choose whether it would participate or not in a new system, but we don't know what this system would look like as we have not presented it,"" she said.  EU leaders are due in March to agree a sweeping overhaul of Europe's migration policy, which is struggling to cope with the 1.1 million refugees who arrived on the continent in 2015.  Officials in Brussels are increasingly concerned that talks on Britain's EU membership are distracting attention from the migration crisis. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, called on Wednesday for his counterpart at the European council, Donald Tusk, to set a date for a further summit in February to debate migration policy.  ""I'm rather worried that we won't have enough time to tackle the refugee question in sufficient depth so I would recommend to Mr Tusk a further summit,"" Juncker said. ""We can't have a success on the UK and not address the refugee crisis - that would be the wrong kind of signal."" This followed a warning from Tusk that the EU had just two months to save its border-free travel zone. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, who chairs EU leaders' meetings, said the EU must agree a new migration strategy at a summit in March. ""The March European council [meeting of EU leaders] will be the last moment to see if our strategy works,"" he told members of the European parliament on Tuesday. ""If it doesn't we will face grave consequences, such as the collapse of Schengen.""  Related: IMF says refugee influx could provide EU economic boost European governments have been putting up fences and re-establishing border controls across the continent, after more than 1 million refugees fleeing chaos and war in the Middle East and Africa landed on Europe's shores in 2015.  The vast majority of refugees have ended up in northern Europe, mainly Germany, Sweden and Austria, prompting these governments to push for mandatory quotas that would result in refugees and migrants being settled across the continent. But fewer than 300 refugees have been resettled under the plan, despite ambitions of finding 160,000 a new home.  The UK has remained outside the quota system because it is not in the Schengen zone, although it is signed up to the Dublin regulation, which obliges member states to take responsibility for refugees who arrive in their country first.  This system has been under strain for years, and was in effect finished off last August when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said all Syrian refugees would be eligible to seek shelter in Germany. Speaking on Wednesday, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said he wanted to ""kill this idea that a refugee himself or herself decided which country to go to ... it should be the European Union [that decides]"".  With thousands of refugees arriving in Greece every day at the peak of the crisis, the EU agreed last year to scrap a rule requiring refugees to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in. The EU is now moving to formalise the end of the Dublin system and is expected to publish a legal text in March. Referring to the plans, Tusk also criticised EU member states for ""a clear delivery deficit on many fronts"", citing failure to find the money for a (EURO)3bn (£2.3bn) action plan agreed with Turkey last year in an attempt to keep more refugees in the region.  The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has also voiced his frustration at the EU's failure to find the funds promised to Turkey to obtain Ankara's help to tackle the refugee crisis. ""I am disappointed and concerned that the (EURO)3bn that the EU agreed to provide Turkey to support their efforts in dealing with the influx of refugees has been held up,"" he said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday. ""The UK made an early commitment to pay its share and I'll continue to push other member states to resolve this as quickly as possible."" The EU's struggle to preserve its border-free travel zone forms the backdrop to its negotiations with the UK, as the British government seeks to rewrite the terms of its EU membership. Officials are increasingly confident they can reach a deal with the UK in February, which Tusk described as ""not easy but possible"". An agreement in February would pave the way for a referendum in June, avoiding holding an autumn vote during the peak time for refugee arrivals. Either way, EU migration and asylum policy is certain to loom large in the campaign.  The campaign to leave the EU has seized on reports that the UK may have to take more refugees in future. ""This change would appear to provide a further incentive for asylum seekers to get across the channel,"" a Vote Leave spokesperson said.",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,0,Policy
1190,src_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,18/3/2016,540 words,Patrick Kingsley Migration correspondent,EU deal with Turkey to send migrants and refugees back - Q&A; Agreement means all those arriving in Greece from Sunday can expect to be returned to Turkey,"What's the deal?  Turkey has agreed to take back any asylum seekers who land in Greece, starting from Sunday. In theory this means the closure of the Aegean smuggling route, via which more than 850,000 people reach Greece from Turkey last year. What does Turkey get in return? The European Union has promised to give Ankara (EURO)6bn (£4.7bn) to help the estimated 2.7 million Syrians now stuck on Turkish soil. It will also become easier for Turks to get European visas, and the EU will pay greater lip-service to the idea of Turkey becoming a member state. For each Syrian returned to Turkey, Europe has promised to accept another Syrian living in a Turkish camp - though if the Aegean flow stops, this mechanism is not likely to see much use. Will this end all migration to Europe?  Related: EU strikes deal with Turkey to send back refugees It will almost certainly cut numbers, but historical migration patterns consistently show that when one route closes, another one opens. Other potential routes lie between Turkey and Bulgaria, Turkey and Italy, Libya and Italy, Morocco and Spain, and Russia and Finland. Is the deal legal? It depends on who you ask. Rights groups say it breaks both EU law and the UN refugee convention, a hallowed text created in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The convention says signatories cannot expel asylum seekers without examining their claims individually. In response, the EU claims people will be examined individually - but since it will suddenly and simultaneously deem Turkey a safe country for refugees, most people will still be sent back en masse.  Related: Syrian refugees still aim for Europe as leaders finalise EU-Turkey deal Is Turkey safe for refugees? The EU suddenly deems it safe, but it has not previously done so - and with good reason. Turkey is not fully signed up to the UN refugee convention; has broken international law by sending back refugees to Syria; and, despite new labour legislation, does not in practice offer most Syrians genuine access to legal work. As a result, many Syrians send their children to work to make ends meet. Non-Syrian refugees have even fewer rights. In logistical terms, can the deal work? It will be a struggle. Greece currently lacks the capacity to process so many asylum claims. Previously it only had to move refugees towards Macedonia; now it has to address their cases directly, and potentially house them for days or weeks while logistics with Turkey are thrashed out. To do this, Greece says it needs Europe to send it 2,500 more asylum officials - a tough ask, given that the EU has failed to send it far smaller numbers in the past. What about the refugees currently stuck in Greece? Since the closure of the Macedonian border, more than 40,000 refugees have been trapped in squalid conditions in Greece. These will not be returned to Turkey under the terms of the deal - but in theory will be shared between the members of the EU. In practice, EU members have failed to uphold earlier articulations of this sharing process in the past, and may yet do so again, leading to a humanitarian crisis in Greece. Some of those trapped may try to move onwards through the Balkans - via Albania, perhaps, and conceivably by sea to Italy.",Broadsheet,0,2016-03,0,Policy

The UN Population Fund and Save the Children are among international organisations braced for Trump to sign leaked executive orders that would have a major impact on funding to the UN and support for US refugee resettlement programmes.  Related: 'Global gag rule': stop playing politics with women's lives, MSF tells Trump One of the leaked orders directly targets any UN agency involved in programmes that support or fund abortion as a method of family planning. The UNFPA estimates that the loss of funding for even one year would prevent the delivery of sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence services to 9 million people in humanitarian settings. ""If we do lose up to $76m [£61m], which is what America provides, it will certainly have great implications for the work that we do around the world,"" said UNFPA executive director Babatunde Osotimehin.  Last year, US contributions to UNFPA core resources accounted for 7% of all core contributions to the organisation. The funding prevented an estimated 320,000 unintended pregnancies, 100,000 unsafe abortions and 10,000 maternal deaths or cases of long-term disability, said the UNFPA.  History does not augur well. Funding to the UNFPA was cut for all eight years under George W Bush, the entire span of his presidency. While other donor countries were able to fill in the gaps then, Osotimehin expressed concern that the needs of the world were now too great - and the resources too few - to satisfactorily meet demand in such circumstances. ""Of course we are worried: the world has changed,"" he said. ""When you look at the sustainable development goals, they're far more than what we pushed for in those days. ""I worry that we might lose out if [the Trump administration] goes forward with this, and that the women and girls and young people who actually need our assistance around the world - I worry we may not be able to meet their needs. Even now, if you take the 2015 resources which we have, it's not enough to do all the work that we do. So losing any part of it is going to be a challenge going forward."" Osotimehin said he had already held preliminary talks with European, Latin American and Asian governments about filling the expected US funding gap.  Much of the UNFPA's work takes place in refugee camps, providing much-needed family planning assistance and maternal healthcare. In Jordan's Zaatari camp, the world's biggest for Syrian refugees, the agency has helped deliver 7,000 babies without a single maternal death. But those living in such camps could now suffer a double blow, with support for USAid-funded family planning clinics cut even as the chances of obtaining US refugee status severely decrease. Having already signed off on a US-Mexico border wall earlier this week, Trump is now expected to sign additional executive orders banning refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East, including Syria, Iraq and Iran.   In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday, Trump said the order targets ""people [who] are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems"". ""Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in who, in many cases or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction,"" he added. Trump's comments were rebutted by Carolyn Miles, president of Save the Children USA, who said the majority of those seeking shelter are children. ""Refugee children have been terrorised. They are not terrorists,"" she said in a statement. ""The reality is that the US refugee resettlement programme saves lives - namely of women and children under 12, who make up 67% of the Syrian refugees in the US. ""More than half of all refugees are children, whose only chance for survival and a better future relies on access to safety. We all have a moral obligation to help.""",Broadsheet,0,2017-01,0,Policy

A report by the body's Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) programme showed that humanitarian assistance rose to $24.5bn (£15.5bn) last year, an increase of 19% on 2013. Middle Eastern donors contributed nearly $1.7bn, a 120% increase on the previous year. Needs continued to outstrip contributions, however. In its coordinated appeals, the UN fell $7.5bn short of the record $19.5bn it requested to help 87.5 million people. This meant 38% of requirements were not met, even though the world's leading donors all gave more.  "" In a year of global discussions on development and climate change, these unprecedented levels of need and continued shortfalls in funding highlight the need to sustainably address the underlying causes and long-term impacts of crisis,"" said Sophia Swithern, head of the GHA programme. Next month, the UN will hold its third international conference on financing for development in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. Member states are expected to draw up concrete plans to finance the sustainable development goals, an ambitious agenda covering the next 15 years that is due to be ratified in New York this September. ""We see from the figures in the report that 93% of the world's extreme poor are in countries that are politically fragile or environmentally vulnerable,"" said Swithern. ""Unless something comes out of Addis and around the SDGs that looks at the poverty questions around those crisis-related areas, you are not going to end poverty and you are not going to solve crises."" Last year, 10.7 million more people worldwide were affected by natural disasters compared with 2013, while conflict and persecution created a record number of displaced people. The report noted that the Ebola crisis received significant support that was not categorised as humanitarian assistance, so the total amount for the year might be higher than the headline figure. The rise in overall humanitarian funding reflected the fact that there were now more people displaced in the Middle East than in Africa. The Syria crisis drew the largest appeals; along with the ongoing conflict in Iraq and the situation in South Sudan, it became a significant driver in last year's $4bn rise in humanitarian funding.  ""The domestic contributions of countries hosting Syrian and Iraqi refugees, most notably Turkey, also continue to be vital,"" the report said. In 2013, Turkey spent $1.6bn helping Syrian refugees. Saudi Arabia joined the list of the top 10 donors after it increased its humanitarian funding by $518m, to $755m. This was the second highest volume increase of all donors, amounting to a trebling of the country's 2013 commitment. The United Arab Emirates became one of the 20 largest contributors after raising its contribution by 317%, from $90m in 2013 to $375m in 2014. ""[Middle Eastern donors] have been key players for a long time, but with the rise of conflict in the region ... we are seeing these donors rising in prominence,"" Swithern said. She added that this was partly down to more standardised reporting by these donors, with whom the world should engage to ensure the quality and quantity of the funding stream. Contributions from private donors rose by an estimated 8%, and accounted for a quarter of international humanitarian assistance. As a group, private donors were the largest international contributor to the typhoon Haiyan response in 2013, and the third largest supporters of the Ebola response last year. The report noted that two-thirds of international humanitarian assistance still went to long-term recipients such as Somalia and Pakistan.  Despite widespread acknowledgement of the importance of local NGOs in delivering relief, initial data from 2014 found that their direct share of total humanitarian funding had halved, from 0.4% in 2012 to 0.2% in 2014. However, data gaps meant it was very hard to trace money all the way from donors to recipients, making it difficult to measure funding to local and national NGOs. ""There is a real groundswell at the moment talking about localising the response in recognition of the role of local and national actors as the first and, in many cases, the best responders,"" Swithern said. She added that more analysis was required to determine how to improve these organisations' access to direct funds. New sources of funding were needed from more diverse donors as well as more efficient methods of delivering the money to those in need, the report said. These issues will be discussed at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul next year, and Swithern said private funding would be a particular focus.  ""This resource that we call international humanitarian assistance is just one piece of the picture,"" she said. ""What we need is a comprehensive solution that involves different mixes of resources for different contexts."" ",Broadsheet,0,2015-06,1,Aid

My family moved here when I was three years old in the 1980s and they are forever grateful."" Hakim said she was relieved Australia had thrown open the doors because the global impact of negative stories about Australia - including the silence around boat arrivals, harsh border protection policies and the Adam Goodes saga - has been profound, and deeply distressing to her. ""The notion that Australia is very laid-back - a place where there is sunshine and people are chilled and relaxed - still exists,"" said Hakim, the award-winning host of BBC World's Impact with Yalda Hakim. ""But there can be some very negative perceptions towards Australia, and I do feel very protective of the country that I grew up in and that gave me my opportunity.

""I said to them, I can understand it, it's not something my great-grandfather did, it's something my father did. ""I was six months old when on horseback in the dead of night with people smugglers he crossed the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan to avoid the Soviet takeover of the country.

As a 25-year-old, Hakim went back to Kabul to retrace her family's steps for a remarkable, emotional Dateline story, and has made the trip several times since, recently interviewing President Hamid Karzai. Hakim has reported from Bangladesh, Libya during the Arab Spring, and was the only journalist to walk through minefields to a village near Kandahar where American soldier Robert Bales massacred 16 civilians. Hakim also spoke of her family's escape from Afghanistan on the ABC's The Drum on Thursday.  A unique combination of on-the-ground reportage and an apparently effortless broadcasting style has given her an edge in the competitive world of television journalism, fronting programs in two countries in her 20s. Now based in Britain, Hakim identifies primarily as Australian. The Hakim family eventually arrived in Australia when she was three, and after a short stay in a hostel in Villawood her architect father encouraged them to jump in to everything Australia had to offer and they all got a good education: ""My parents are so protective about Australia they won't hear a bad word about it.""

Earlier, she had given a lecture at Sydney University, where a young woman had asked her how she ""made it in Australia as a woman of colour"". Hakim said she was so taken aback by the question because she had always seen herself as an Australian journalist first who happened to have an Afghan background and that having another cultural background had never held her back.

Related: Seven in 10 Australians think the government should do more to help refugees In a global survey of 27,000 people across 27 countries, nearly 70% said their governments should being doing more to help refugees, while 80% said they would accept refugees living in their country, city, or neighbourhood. One in 10 would welcome a refugee to live in their own home, with the figure rising to 46% in China and 29% in the UK.  China and the UK were first and third respectively on Amnesty's Refugees Welcome Index, with Germany in second place.  In Germany, a country that received 1.1 million asylum seekers in 2015, almost every respondent (96%) said they would accept refugees in their country, while only 3% said refugees should be refused entry. And 76% of German respondents said their government should be doing more to assist refugees. Of UK respondents:  84% agreed that ""people should be able to take refuge in other countries to escape war or persecution"". 7o% believed the government should do more to help refugees fleeing war or persecution. 82% would welcome refugees living in their city, town, or village. 76% would welcome refugees living in their neighbourhood. 29% would welcome refugees living in their own home. In many cases the response of people appears at odds with their country's political culture, such as in Australia, which is fifth on Amnesty's index.  While the country has hardline policies towards people seeking asylum on its shores, including mandatory and sometimes indefinite detention in remote island camps overseas, seven in 10 people believe the country should do more to help people displaced by war or persecution. The Australian immigration minister, Peter Dutton, claimed, in the midst of an election campaign this week, that Australia could not accept more refugees because most were what he described as uneducated, illiterate, and would take Australian jobs or be a drain on the welfare system. ""For many people, they won't be, you know, numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English. These people would be taking Australian jobs, there's no question about that. For many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in unemployment queues and on Medicare."" Dutton's own department commissioned a report which found refugees make valuable economic and social contributions to Australia. ""The research found the overwhelming picture... is one of considerable achievement and contribution,"" the department said in its own summation of the findings. The overwhelming majority - 86% - of the world's refugees do not live in industrialised nations, but are hosted in developing countries, usually close to the one they fled. In those countries, attitudes to asylum seekers are overwhelmingly positive, according to the Amnesty research. In Jordan, a country that already hosts 650,000 Syrian refugees, 84% of people believe their government should do more to assist refugees fleeing war or persecution. A quarter of Lebanon's population are refugees and 69% of that country's citizens believe their government should do more to assist.  ""These figures speak for themselves,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general. ""People are ready to make refugees welcome, but governments' inhumane responses to the refugee crisis are badly out of touch with their own citizens'.

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has said the decision will mean that other groups such as Iraqi, Palestinian and Kurdish minorities who sought refuge in Syria before the conflict but have had to flee again can now be helped. It will also mean that mixed nationality family groups will also become eligible. Rudd said the decision follows advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that a diversified resettlement quota is needed in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable refugees in the region. Up until March 7,307 Syrian refugees, identified by the UNHCR, had been brought to Britain under the resettlement scheme. Half of them have been children. The decision to extend the scope of the scheme will not however lead to any increase in the 20,000 limit. Rudd said: ""It is vitally important that we focus our support on the most vulnerable refugees in the region who have fled the atrocities in Syria, whatever their nationality. I am proud that the UK is continuing to be proactive and by expanding the scheme we are making sure our doors continue to remain open to the people who most need our help."" She said that 235 local authorities across the UK had stepped up to provide places under the government's refugee resettlement programmes. The Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme was expanded by David Cameron in September 2015 to take 20,000 from the refugee camps bordering Syria in response to the Mediterranean refugee crisis. It followed a decision by Britain to withdrew its financial support for proactive search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean for refugees and migrants at risk of their lives in open boats. The refugee resettlement scheme in Britain is open to the most vulnerable refugees who have fled the Syrian conflict and cannot return to their country of origin whatever their nationality. The home secretary said the decision also demonstrated that Britain intended to play its part in tackling the global migration crisis by taking refugees from the region - from Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt - as well as providing humanitarian assistance in response to the Mediterranean migration crisis. ""Our approach is rightly based on targeting our support so that it delivers the most impact, helps those who need it the most and avoids unintended consequences,"" she added. In the Commons, Rudd was challenged by the Liberal Democrat MP, Tom Brake, over why only 200 ""Dubs children"" - a reference Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who successfully secured the original commitment to take refugee children - had so far arrived when the government had promised to take 480 lone child refugees who had made it to Europe. The home secretary told him that efforts were under way with Italy and Greece to identify children who might benefit from the remaining places: ""I am aware of these numbers. We have made it clear that we are ready and stand able to take those additional children.

The home secretary told MPs yesterday that the UK government would give priority to victims of torture, women and children in need, as well as victims of sexual violence, or those requiring medical care. Her statement was welcomed by Labour, but the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, queried why the government had held out against becoming full members of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) scheme in which 18 other countries are participating. The Conservatives deniedthat the coalition had been forced into a U-turn by pressure from charities and Labour, but said its previous reluctance was due to fears that letting in refugees to the UK would undermine efforts to help displaced people on the Syrian border. May said the coalition's plans had been cleared with the UNHCR in London and had its endorsement. She said the targeted and distinct scheme would be open to those most in need but would not involve quotas, adding that it would work in parallel with the UN scheme. May said: ""This is in the spirit of the UNHCR programme, but is not technically part of it. We took a very simple decision which is that we wanted to create a scheme that provided sufficient flexibility and which enables us to focus on women and girls at risk, as well as preventing sexual violence."" In practice, the UNHCR is likely to recommend individuals for the UK scheme, but the UK will be responsible for choosing the successful candidates and ensuring they get access to the relevant specialist help in the UK. May promised that Britain would not allow the breakup of families or the separation of children from parents. But she said she would not set a target because the numbers coming would be driven by need and not an arbitrary number. Whitehall sources briefed that about 500 refugees might be allowed. Germany is expecting to take as many as 10,000. A minority of Tory backbenchers have expressed anger at May's U-turn, with Andrew Bridgen describing the decision as ""political posturing and tokenism based on political expediency"". May said the refugees would be given temporary residence in the UK, with access to the labour market and other benefits in the same way as other refugees would have. Cooper said: ""Compassion and common sense have prevailed over the government's resistance last week. We and many others have argued for some time that a minority of refugees are too vulnerable to cope or survive in the camps - abandoned children, torture victims, women who have been abused, those needing medical help."" The shadow home secretary welcomed the fact that May had bowed to the political pressure applied by Labour, including its decision to raise the issue at prime minister's questions and to call an opposition Commons debate yesterday.

Hailing the prospects of the summit, Herve Verhoosel, the summit's spokesman, said: ""It's the first time in 70 years of UN history that a summit has been organised to talk about humanitarian issues.

MSF has even pulled out of the conference, saying it no longer believes that the assembled leaders have any genuine desire to make binding commitments.

Oxfam GB's chief executive, Mark Goldring, said: ""This summit needs to be more than an expensive talking shop by tackling the repeated failure of governments to resolve conflicts and end the culture of impunity in which civilians are killed without consequence. Goldring added: ""Rich nations cannot wash their hands of the suffering for which they are partly responsible and [must] do more to take in their fair share of the world's most vulnerable people. Recent moves such as the EU-Turkey deal and the plans to outsource EU border controls to African countries with dubious human rights records set a dangerous precedent, horse trading the rights of refugees in order to keep them from our doorstep and shirking responsibility for their welfare.  ""Last week, the Kenyan government pointed to the example of European countries turning away Syrian refugees when it announced the closure of the Dadaab refugee camp."" Verhoosel said he was disappointed by the criticism, arguing that the UN and its members had to start somewhere, and that this week's gathering could be that starting point. ""We need to try to do what we can during the summit,"" said Verhoosel, questioning how critics could pre-empt the outcome of an event that has not yet happened.

The Kurdish couple's five-year-old daughter, Vian, suffers from a blood condition, so the team lined up doctors who could treat her and leased the family a house with a direct bus to the hospital. They also assigned the family a caseworker, Nael Nsemwa, who would show them around the city. Until recently, only three councils in the UK had welcomed refugees through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme, which was launched in January 2014. Coventry was one. By this summer, the West Midlands city had quietly received 78 of the 216 Syrians who came to the UK through the programme. Now, as dozens of local authorities scramble to plan for new Syrian refugees - a promised 20,000 by 2020 - Coventry offers a model of resettlement for other councils.  Related: Life as a Syrian refugee: 'We will be good people. We will build the country' Each local authority can develop its own approach to resettlement, and Coventry relies on three non-profit organisations to cover the nuts and bolts. The local Citizens Advice bureau, Coventry law centre and the Coventry refugee and migrant centre between them enlist private and social landlords to house refugees, provide interpreters and English classes, collect donations of clothes and household goods, register the refugees with GPs and schools. Staff from the three organisations also serve as caseworkers, linking each family to the services and support they need during their first year. ""We had suffered through so much in Syria, in the refugee camps and in Erbil,"" says Abdulrahman through a translator. He recounts how their search for treatment for Vian pushed the family out of Syria, into Iraqi Kurdistan, and here. ""We were overwhelmed to find everything that we needed when we arrived, and Nael, who helped us with our home, the bills, hospitals, doctors, school - everything."" Since arriving in Coventry, Vian has been receiving regular blood transfusions as she awaits a bone marrow donor - her only shot at a cure. She has more energy than her seven-year-old sister, Lian, and her nine-year-old brother, Bilind. Just last week, Vian won an award in school. Her mother pulls open her purse and unfurls a small sheet of white paper. ""Best Respect to Our School,"" it reads. There was a 'getting-everyone-to-jump-at-once' moment  Simon Blake, who masterminded Coventry's action on refugees  Simon Brake, Coventry city council's director of primary care, sustainability, and integration, masterminded Coventry's approach in early 2014. He found political support from the Labour council leader Ann Lucas, and then consulted local non-profit organisations and community leaders. ""There was a getting-everyone-to-jump-at-once moment, which had to be wrangled,"" says Brake. ""But this was a common purpose of public good that everybody got behind."" Brake entered into negotiations with the Home Office, which funds the refugee relocation scheme, and the Coventry programme was up and running within months. The council estimates the first-year cost of the scheme has been about £300,000. Funding follows individual refugees' first year. Since some will have been in the city for a year and others just a few weeks, it is not the total cost for all the relocated refugees. For housing costs, the Home Office pays the rent until housing benefit kicks in, usually within a couple of months. Case files on vulnerable Syrians now pass from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to the Home Office in London, and then on to receiving councils. In Coventry, the three not-for-profit organisations work as a trio to ensure the city can support the refugees. The caseworkers quickly realised they could work faster and more effectively under one roof, and one supervisor. Now they are all based in the same office, where they can trade tips and share language skills with ease. When Nsemwa needs to send a quick text to the Abdulrahmans, she just taps the shoulder of an Arabic-speaking colleague. Julie Faulkner oversees the programme's caseworkers from the office of Citizens Advice. In the early days of the programme, she, alone, furnished the homes, made the beds, and hung the curtain rails in preparation for each family's arrival. ""It wasn't your classic project management,"" she says. It still isn't, but at least she has hired a staff member to make the flats and houses ready. Over the course of the year, caseworkers help families register for services, advise them on employment and career goals, and teach them where to find help when the year-long programme ends. ""For these people leaving Syria, it isn't always a glorious new start as they get off the plane,"" says Faulkner. ""They're thinking, 'Well, what's happening now?' Their calmness only comes after a few months."" Coventry has a long history of receiving refugees. For years it has been an active member of City of Sanctuary, a UK-wide organisation born in Sheffield in 2005. The organisation now has 40 active groups across the country, dedicated to building a culture of hospitality for refugees. Tiffy Allen, the network's coordinator, says that more than 20 towns and cities have called up to start new Sanctuary groups in the last two months alone. ""We're calling it a revolution in generosity,"" she says. As Coventry begins to welcome 100 new Syrian refugees each year, dozens of councils across the country have recently agreed to resettle Syrian refugees too. The swell of local government support comes on the heels of local residents' efforts to arrange homes and services for Syrian refugees following high profile press coverage and shocking images of their plight over the summer. According to Citizens UK, the nationwide community organising group, 40 councils have committed to host more than 3,000 Syrian refugees. But Charlotte Fischer, a community organiser at Citizens UK, says local authorities are quite nervous and feel they haven't got the guidance they need. ""So we have organised teams of local people who said [they] will help assemble private landlords, surgeries, and the local community to make sure this can work well,"" she says. Citizens UK reports that their local organising has been the driving force behind 10 of the councils that have agreed to resettle refugees. Despite the groundswell of support from councils, negotiations between the Local Government Association (LGA) and the government for extra funding drag on. As councillors meet with local non-profit organisations and individuals to plan for newcomers, the LGA is asking the Home Office to fund councils beyond the first year of each refugee's arrival. ""We are pressing for a detailed commitment so that communities can welcome refugees knowing that they will not be left with an unfair burden,"" says councillor David Simmons, chairman of the LGA's asylum, refugee and migration taskforce. In the meantime, Brake is fielding phone calls and attending meetings with other councils to share the lessons he has learned from his resettlement work in Coventry. The Abdulrahmans say that for the first time in years they feel they are respected and treated as if they are citizens. ""In Iraq, we had nothing,"" says Abdulrahman. ""We've been here three months and we feel like we have everything, and all the rights that we wanted."" Kinjo nods in agreement. ""I just hope now for my family in Syria and Iraq to be safe,"" she adds. ""The UK saved us, but our families are not saved yet.""",Broadsheet,0,2015-10,1,Aid

The money is due to be allocated to help countries in the region surrounding Syria, primarily Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, with a focus on Syrian children's education and improving the chances of refugees finding paid work.   The conference in February accepted that many refugees were likely to be living outside Syria on a long-term basis and may never be able to return to their country torn apart by a five-year civil war. In total $12.1bn (£8.3bn) was pledged at the Supporting Syria and the Region conference, organised by the British prime minister, David Cameron. It was said to be the largest amount ever raised for a humanitarian crisis in a single day. The report written by Concern Worldwide shows $6bn was promised for 2016 at the conference, but that by mid April only $1.16 billion had been committed.  The report shows 94% of the London conference donors had not turned their pledges into actual commitments, and 18 of the donors that made pledges had committed none of their funds, including Kuwait (one of the co-hosts). It also suggests that 98% of Saudi Arabia's pledge, 96% of the UK's pledge, over 89% of Germany's and the EC's pledges were all still outstanding. Only three donors (Australia, Malta, Lithuania) had fully committed their funding pledges. The report also found that by the end of April, 52% of pledged funds had yet to be allocated to an implementing organisation, 47% had not been allocated to a particular appeal, and 28% had not been allocated to a recipient country affected by the crisis.  The speed of the pledges matter since it is hard for aid agencies to make plans without long-term allocated commitments. Simon Starling, head of advocacy at Concern Worldwide (UK) and the report's author, said:""Pledges are just words until they are translated into commitments; donors have simply not acted fast enough. The statistics indicate there is a critical time-lapse between donors voicing their pledges and turning them into a financial reality. It is Syrians that pay the price of this delay.""  The report also claims that too many of the pledges are skewed towards neighbouring countries, when there are huge humanitarian needs inside the country. The report shows the London conference donors have so far allocated three times the amount of money to the regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) than to the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).  Starling said: ""The humanitarian response in neighbouring countries continues to garner more funds than the response inside Syria, which is where the majority of people in need remain. This balance must be redressed, and donor governments must push all parties to the conflict to grant unconditional humanitarian access to reach those most in need."" The report's authors said: ""Monitoring of commitments made at the London conference to date has been inadequate and opaque. Formal, public frameworks must be established to hold donors and governments to account for their commitments. ""The co-hosts of the London conference must work with refugee-hosting countries to track policy as well as financial commitments. Donors should work with the United Nations to develop suitable accountability structures that can capture both humanitarian and developing funding for protracted crises. This effort should include an agreed maximum timeframe to turn financial pledges into a reality.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,0,Aid

Sixteen refugees, including three children, have been killed trying to escape the battlegrounds of northern Syria in the past four months, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a frequently cited watchdog.  It is shocking to think of people fleeing the combined atrocities of Islamic State and Bashar al-Assad being gunned down just as they make their bid for safety. But what is perhaps most shocking of all is that we observers are still shocked by this.  The shooting of Syrians on the border is not a new phenomenon. Refugees and rights groups have reported shootings of migrants on the Turkish-Syrian border since at least 2013. These abuses are well-documented, and the reports widely circulated. So why, in the months following a shady European deal that forces Turkey to shoulder the biggest burden of the refugee crisis, are we still so appalled when Turkey continues to use deadly violence to stop that burden getting any bigger?  Related: The Guardian view on the EU-Turkey deal: the victims will be its judges | Editorial A surge in border abuses is the logical result of a recent deal that sees the world's richest continent (population 500 million) corral a single Middle Eastern country (population 80 million) into caring for more Syrian refugees than the rest of the world combined. We shouldn't have expected any other outcome. But sadly, some did. And Europe's leaders - including David Cameron - apparently still do. Turkey is in the process of being designated by the EU as a ""safe third country"" for refugees - a sobriquet that gives Greece the right to send back almost all of those who land on its shores from Turkey. Leaders, including Cameron, have justified this with the claim that refugees are safe from mortal danger in Turkey. Border shootings show this is not always strictly true, as do well-substantiated allegations that Turkey has illegally returned some Syrians and Afghans to the danger of their home countries, even after they had safely settled on Turkish soil. An alarming new report by Amnesty International, released today, alleges that in recent weeks large groups of Syrians have been deported back to Syria from southern Turkey, as officials there attempt to reduce their refugee burden.  Related: Refugee crisis: What does the EU's deal with Turkey mean? In Cameron's favour, most refugees in Turkey are not at risk of death on a battlefield. But this is not what refugee advocates mean when they say that Turkey is an unsuitable place for refugees. Refugee rights extend far beyond the simple right to life: they include the right to education, to healthcare and to work. The point of giving people refugee status is to guarantee them all the opportunities that are extended to natural-born citizens of the country in which they now live. For all its generosity in welcoming more refugees than any other country, Turkey does not offer such a guarantee. Take the right to work. EU politicians justified their deportation deal with the claim that a new Turkish law, introduced in January, has now given Syrians access to legal employment.  That isn't actually the case. To qualify for a work permit, two things need to happen. First, a Syrian needs to have held a certain kind of ID card, known as a kimlik, for six months - and not everyone can get one. Second, an applicant's employer must give the Syrian a contract. Very few employers would ever want to do this, since the reason most Syrians find work on the black marker in the first place is precisely because they are illegal: they can be paid far less than the minimum wage, and work far longer than the legal daily limit. Many employers would rather fire a Syrian than pay him properly.  The first deportations of Syrians back to Turkey are set to begin on Monday. With little access to employment, the threat of deportation to Syria looming large and shootings on the border, we should be under no illusions that the deportees are being sent to safety.

One source said Ankara was seeking (EURO)20bn. Turkey also wants visa-free travel in the EU from June, instead of waiting for a planned October review of preparatory measures.  One EU diplomat said Berlin and some allies were open to bringing forward the date if Ankara met all the requirements including changing its visa policy for Islamic states and introducing biometric passports.  EU leaders voiced concern and unease that the offer of increased cooperation coincided with a crackdown on media freedom that runs counter to cherished European values.

""With that,"" said Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, with all the confidence of a magician at a circus, ""we will close the western Balkans route.""  It is a hubristic claim - but one that nevertheless reflects the new hardline agenda that much of Europe's top brass hopes to push through during today's migration summit between European and Turkish leaders.   People queue to receive tea at a makeshift camp near the Greek-Macedonian border. Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images  As if by magic, Tusk and his allies seek to end the European refugee crisis in two clean movements.  First: by rubber-stamping the closure of the Macedonian-Greek border, where hundreds of thousands of refugees have crossed in the past year in their march northwards towards northern Europe.  Second: by strong-arming Turkey into readmitting most if not all of the asylum-seekers who continue to land on the Greek islands in their thousands every day.  Tusk's logic is straightforward. If the Macedonian border can be shut, then the crisis can be contained in Greece. And if refugees can be returned to Turkey, then the damage wrought on cash-strapped Greece will in turn become manageable.  Even if Tusk's plan has obvious moral implications - it risks undermining the 1951 refugee convention, which was one of the seminal human achievements of the post-Holocaust era - one can understand its practical appeal for European politicians. But as has become familiar throughout this migration crisis, the logic of Europe's leadership does not acknowledge the reality on the ground.  For a start, Turkey's compliance is not a foregone conclusion. The Turkish government will be less keen on re-accepting boat people if Europe does not - as a quid pro quo - formally resettle significant numbers of the 2.5 million Syrian refugees currently on Turkish soil. And even if such a formal resettlement scheme emerges, it may take months before Turkey is logistically able to reaccept the large numbers of asylum-seekers who continue to land on the Greek islands. Turkey must in turn arrange readmission agreements with the countries where those asylum-seekers come from - and this kind of wrangling will take time.  Children and women sit on the ground as they waited overnight to register at the makeshift camp at the Greek-Macedonian border. Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images  In the interim, increasing numbers of asylum-seekers will continue to reach Greece. If Tusk's Macedonian plan works, then Greece faces a dystopian nightmare; it will become a cage for hundreds of thousands of foreigners, with the local authorities lacking the resources needed to house or process them.  But that's only if the Balkans can in fact be hermetically sealed off from Greece.  ""With that"", Tusk says, the Balkans can be shut. Yet past experience suggests that it can't.  In the early 90s, following the collapse of the Albanian dictatorship , at least 250,000 Albanians made the perilous crossing over the mountainous Greek-Albanian border. Aid workers say a few Syrians are beginning to try the same route - 25 years later. Some may reinvigorate the Albanian-Italian maritime smuggling route, which was once a major thoroughfare for asylum-seekers. Then there's the Greek-Bulgarian land border, which was still impregnated by around 30,000 people in 2015, despite the construction of a fence along parts of its length.  Finally, some analysts expect a spike in illegal crossings of the Black Sea from northern Turkey towards Ukraine and the eastern Balkans.

The new edition of German weekly Der Spiegel quotes Günther Oettinger the European commissioner for energy, saying that ""Europe should offer Turkey the prospect of financial support beyond 2017.

Good morning, we'll be following the developments live in Brussels today as European leaders try once more to reach agreement with Turkey over the thousands of refugees and migrants crossing from the country into Europe.  Last year a joint action plan was agreed with the aim of keeping more refugees outside of Europe. The EU pledged (EURO)3bn for housing and food for the estimated three million refuge es currently living in Turkey, in return for a clampdown on people smugglers.  People wait to enter Macedonia from Greece near Idomeni. Photograph: Georgi Licovski/EPA  But recent discussions have ended in clashes, with EU leaders accusing the Turkey of repeated failures to reduce the crossings. Every day between 1,000 to 2,000 people are landing on Greece's shores, and 35,000 people are trapped in the country, unable to travel north as a result of border closures.   Turkey, for its part, says the EU has not turned its funding into workable refugee aid. The Turkish deputy ambassador to Britain, Cem Isik, said his government had already spent more than (EURO)8bn (£6.2bn) on the crisis and only negligible amounts have arrived from the EU. Here are some of the the key points for discussion: Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's prime minister, has signalled the country may be willing to accept people being returned to Turkey if they do not qualify for asylum in Europe, such as Moroccans and Pakistanis. Last week, more than 300 people were sent back to Turkey from Greece, hailed as a major step forward by EU diplomats. Greece has been trying for more than two months to return almost 900 people to Turkey. EU leaders will also officially declare the western Balkans route to Europe closed, though this is already the reality for refugees who had hoped to travel that route to Germany or other northern European countries. A draft communique reads: This route is now closed. The EU will stand by Greece in this difficult moment and will do it utmost to help manage the situation.  A Syrian refugee is helped by a volunteer to leave a sinking dinghy at a beach on the Greek island of Lesbos. Photograph: Manu Brabo/AP  But this is the clincher, is it legal, and is it the right thing to do? The Geneva conventions prohibit the return of asylum seekers who have not received a fair hearing, and Vincent Cochetel, who is leading the UN refugee agency's response to the European crisis, hinted to the FT that EU courts may not look kindly on the agreement, unless Turkish asylum law changes to guarantee those returned have the opportunity to claim refuge. Human rights groups are also concerned. Here's what Judith Sunderland, acting deputy director for the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch, thinks of the deal: EU leaders are in a panic to stop refugee flows before spring, and they seem willing to throw human rights overboard in the process.  It is naked self-interest and wishful thinking to say Turkey is a safe country of asylum - it is not, and this deal could cause much more harm than good. The timing of the summit is awkward, given that over the weekend the Turkish newspaper Zaman was seized by the government and its editor-in-chief removed, sparking an outcry over press freedoms. On a similar note: There will also be a gathering of the European commission next week, focusing on proposals to overhaul the EU's asylum system, which requires refugees to register and be processed in the country they arrive in. That system has essentially broken down over the past year, with so many thousands of people arriving on the shores of Italy and Greece.",Broadsheet,0,2016-03,1,Policy

Thursday 10th September 2015. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian  It is time to pull up the stumps and throw them in the fireplace. Perhaps that's too extreme. In any case it is time to stop the updates. Thank you for your company all week. I'll be on the couch on Insiders this weekend for another wrap of the parliamentary week in another form if you haven't had quite enough of my shouting. The wonderful, calm and always reasonable Gabrielle Chan will be back driving the Politics Live bus next week. Today, Thursday: The prime minister went to Port Moresby for the Pacific Island Forum, leaving colleagues to tend shop. In his absence, the defence minister Kevin Andrews thought we'd be in Syria militarily for two or three years, the foreign minister Julie Bishop thought years not months, the Nationals leader Warren Truss thought we'd be there until the job was done, and Abbott himself thought he'd rather not be specific. Labor's deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said she would not support boots on the ground in Syria. Air strikes in the collective self defence of Iraq, sure. Getting embroiled in a civil war? No. The social services minister Scott Morrison continued to insist that most of the 12,000 refugees coming from Syria in the special one-off intake would be Christians. The prime minister continued to say the cohort would consist of persecuted groups, which would include Christians. And others. The government senate leader Eric Abetz reviewed what he said on the subject earlier this week and continued to agree with himself, while repositioning ever so slightly. Perhaps they will all split the difference. Government officials held a secret briefing to tell some reporters that the unemployment rate would go up today, possibly to the highest level in more than a decade, but there was nothing to worry about because this would just reflect more activity testing for unemployed people, which was a good thing. Unemployment, when the figures were released, actually went down, and participation went down too in seasonally adjusted terms. This was all a bit strange, but the man to explain was Abetz, who proceeded in the course of his explanation to take issue with a couple of previously uncontroversial principles of economics because he didn't agree with them. The government over-egged its question time attack on Labor on the China free trade deal. The free trade deal vanished abruptly and was replaced by a new thing called the China export agreement. Labor pointed out that if this was a bilateral free trade agreement, it would include imports as well as exports. Trade minister Andrew Robb was the man to explain this. Unfortunately Robb had said just before question time that it wouldn't be difficult to address Labor's concerns about labour conditions - but it would embarrass the Chinese. This rather undercut one of the government's arguments that one can't possibly reopen the FTA transaction, given Robb had acknowledged that he could. Robb then got very vexed with Labor not listening, and he advised the opposition to shut up. Someone else was a goose. All a bit messy. There was more, but that's the main overview. Have a great weekend. Hug your loved ones. See you all round like a rissole. block-time published-time 8.39am BST  Murph can't post her summary yet, I have a contribution! As she's mentioned, the senate legal committee is currently hearing submissions on the matter of a popular vote, in the form of a plebiscite or referendum, on same sex marriage in Australia. The hearing is expected to go until about 9.30pm tonight, with senators hearing from 28 experts separated into six groups; legal and policy experts, religious organisations, LGBTI organisations and support groups, psychologists, constitutional law experts, and staff from the Australian electoral commission. So far we've heard from the legal and policy group and have almost finished hearing from the religious organisations, which includes the Australian Christian Lobby's Lyle Shelton and the Australian Family Association's Terri Kelleher. The majority of legal and policy experts have argued against a plebiscite or referendum, because federal parliament already has the power under the constitution to legislate for it. Associate Professor Paula Gerber, deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, said that a plebiscite was likely to harm children raised by LGBTI couples and LGBTI youth generally because of the sustained, public debate that would ensue. ""To have a publicly sanctioned campaign that allows vitriol against these two groups of children is likely to cause them significant harm,"" she said. ""We saw the sort of dialogue that ensued from the Gayby Baby film that ensured in NSW, and for that to be replicated on a national level is not going to be in the best interest of children and for that reason a plebiscite on the issue should not be held."" Meanwhile, the majority of catholic and christian groups have told the senate a popular vote was the best way forward. ""With all due respect,"" she told the senators not a lot of children tuned in to parliament.  Lyle Shelton, managing director of the Australian Christian Lobby, said parliaments had already given the issue a ""pretty good go"". It was time for the public to have a say, he said, and religious groups should not be censored in the lead-up to a vote, he said. The groups said the media had censored their ads opposing same-sex marriage, refusing to run them. ""We need to break shackles of political correctness around the debate,"" Shelton said. ""Many are fearful they will be labelled as bigots. This is not a debate against people or individuals. It's a debate about what marriage is, what family structure is, and what is in the interest of children. There should be freedom in the discussion to advocate for this side of the debate. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.39am BST block-time published-time 8.33am BST   Now Eric  I wondered whether someone other than a nit-picking uber nerd like me would take issue with the government senate leader, Eric Abetz, transcending economics at his unemployment data press conference today. If you had to identify another random nit-picking uber nerd prowling around the parliamentary precinct, who would you nominate? Probably one with a serious economics qualification, (unlike my baby economics, which concluded in a formal education sense at year twelve.) I raised my eyebrows when Abetz said earlier today there was no unemployment number that was acceptable, not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6%. While we get the Abetz vibe, it was somewhat off piste for a minister serving in an economic portfolio. Take the microphone Andrew Leigh, shadow assistant treasurer, and former economics professor, who explains the issue with a teacher's precision. The employment numbers will always record some level of unemployment because of workers moving between jobs. This frictional unemployment can be found in even the healthiest economy. Economists like to argue over what rate should be considered 'full employment'. But almost no-one except minister Abetz seriously believes the headline unemployment number can ever dip below 3% without triggering a sharp rise in inflation. Structural unemployment counts the number of people who are excluded from the jobs market because there are more people looking for work than there are jobs available. I'll post a summary next. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.33am BST block-time published-time 8.03am BST  Green senator Janet Rice opens her questions to the Australian Christian Lobby by pointing out the ACL has said for years changing the Marriage Act should be a very low priority for the parliament but now the ACL's position is the issue should be settled by a plebiscite ""at great public expense.""

This issue has come to the parliament several times and been rejected. Now it needs to go to the people for resolution. block-time published-time 7.49am BST  The legal and constitutional affairs committee is holding hearings this afternoon on the same sex marriage plebiscite.

It's a more than reasonable question, that she's comprehensively declined to answer.  Penny Wong:  We will continue to press our case. The only person who is a risk to the implementation of the free trade agreement is Tony Abbott. Labor is of course a risk to the implementation of the free trade agreement if it votes down the legislation required to bring it into force. block-time published-time 7.31am BST  My colleague Ben Doherty has written an analysis about the two tiered refugee system that the president of the Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, spoke about early this morning (one rule for Syrians already here, another rule for the Syrians coming under the new cohort of 12,000). He's included a couple figures that I reckon are worth a moment's reflection. On the point of wastefulness, Australia's monetary contribution to assist Syrian refugees, also announced on Wednesday, exposes the absurd cost of offshore detention. Australia will contribute an additional $44m to those displaced by the Syrian conflict. This will assist 240,000 people with food, drinking water, blankets, and shelter for the impending, harsh winter. Yet the Australian government pays more than that - $60m - every single month to Transfield Services to detain 1,500 people on Nauru and Manus in conditions successive parliamentary inquiries have described as violent, abusive, and dangerous. Just roll that over in your mind - $44m for 240,000 people versus $60m a month. block-time published-time 7.02am BST  Something about a parliamentary afternoon on Thursday that makes everyone want to run away.

Thursday 10th September 2015. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian  We've see it before, government proposes an economic reform, with a certain amount of complexity and political risk - but is immediately outflanked by interest groups who establish the terms of the debate before the ink is even dry on the policy papers. We saw it with the mining tax. We saw it with the carbon pricing scheme. The no case was telegraphed more simply and effectively than the yes case - putting the Labor government behind the eight ball from the start. We are seeing it now with the China free trade agreement. Way too late, the government is trying to set the terms of the conversation about the agreement. The government is not only very late, but it is engaging in silly acts of harm to the cause. Take two small parliamentary examples this week: the silly motion from Tony Abbott which was designed to pressure Labor about its objections to aspects of the FTA. Labor ran rings around the government in the house tactically, delaying the start of the debate for more than thirty minutes, then making a clearer case than the government about the specific objections. Bill Shorten does not always rise to the occasion in making a simple point, quite often he can't nail an argument, but he managed in the debate. In contrast to the shaming stunt from the government, Labor's pitch was to first frustrate the flow of the conversation, and then sue for peace. It was a better pitch on the day, and the prime minister knew it. His frustration was evident. Now today's contribution. Whomever thought it was a clever idea to rebadge the China free trade agreement the China export agreement really should not be working in professional politics. It was undergraduate and stupid. To borrow a concept from a good friend of mine, a good line is one you shouldn't notice. How better to draw attention to the fact that you are losing the argument in the court of public opinion than to pull something as crude and obvious as that? Labor called it out in about two minutes. Trade agreements are about exports and imports - to pretend the second bit of the transaction doesn't exist only serves to highlight your own nervousness. Labor in government pulled similar little outbreaks of stupid at moments of pressure, and the voters never thank governments that fundamentally lack the courage of their convictions. So here's a little thought for the government. The trade deal with China is a big deal for this country over the long haul. It would be good to develop a more effective means of explaining its benefits and being open about its impact on the country. And if we can take Andrew Robb at his word, if it really isn't difficult to address Labor's concerns, why not do it? Take what is reasonable from the Labor shopping list and bin what isn't. Drop the silly politics, the weasel wording, the faux fighting, and set about building a legacy. Let's face it, this government could really use one. At the moment the government is running the risk of repeating Labor's key miscalculation with emissions trading several years ago, when Kevin Rudd thought he was being clever by using climate action as a political wedge against the then Liberal party leader Malcolm Turnbull.

Warren Truss says he can't offer specifics, but we'll be there for as long as it takes. We are there to do a job, and we will be there until the job is finished. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.06am BST block-time published-time 5.00am BST  Continuing the theme of wheels coming ever so slightly off, the trade minister Andrew Robb has just told Sky News that doing what Labor wants on the China FTA would not be difficult. Asked why it is so hard to change enabling legislation, Robb relied: It's not difficult, but it creates all sorts of complications. Robb says if the fineprint of the China agreement is tinkered with, and other trade deals are left to stand, this will be ""an almighty snub"" to Beijing. I suspect voters would be more concerned about job security than a snub to Beijing - but perhaps that's just me. block-time published-time 4.51am BST   Quick sticks  Very quick summary of what the morning has delivered. Defence minister Kevin Andrews says Australia will be in Syria for two or three years, foreign minister Julie Bishop said years, not months or days, and the prime minister doesn't think it's helpful to put a time frame on the commitment. The government has not ruled out putting boots on the ground in Syria, but Labor's deputy leader Tanya Plibersek says no, and no to military involvement in Syria beyond the defence of Iraq. Social services minister Scott Morrison thought the new refugee intake would be made up predominantly of Christians even though the prime minister thought it would be made up of people who were persecuted, regardless of their religion. Unemployment went down a jot, even though unnamed government officials had told some but not all reporters that it would go up. Employment minister Eric Abetz tried to re-invent economics. Possibly that was a diversion from the strange (incorrect) briefing for the select group. I gather now the strange incorrect select briefing was organised by the prime minister's office. Onwards.

Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian  Abetz has reviewed the transcript of what he said earlier this week on the subject of Christian persecution and he's established that he in fact said what he said on the subject and doesn't intend to be misrepresented. After the review of said transcript, Abetz tells reporters that he said Christians needed to be a focus of the humanitarian effort. Not the focus. Or the only focus. A focus. This is perfectly reasonable, Abetz says, in close review of himself. He'd invite anyone who has an issue with what he's said to review what he's said. All of this needs to be worked out on the basis of need. Clear? Good. block-time published-time 4.19am BST  Workplace minister Eric Abetz is now speaking to reporters about the jobless figures. Abetz says a 6-5-4-3-2 or a 1 in front of the national unemployment figure is unacceptable. (This might surprise economists, given there is a concept called the natural rate of unemployment, and I'm pretty sure that number is higher than 1.) Abetz then throws off economic orthodoxy again by declaring he wants a different measure of employment. I've said this in the past and I don't know why it is, but the economists tell me that if you are employed for one hour per week, you are considered to be in employment. I think we would all be agreed that that is an insufficient period of employment to be considered employed. (Goooooo Eric.) He then suggests if the China FTA was in force unemployment would be much better in South Australia because the wine tariff would be gone. (Never mind the car industry. Never mind ship building. If unemployment is the question he wine tariff is the answer.) Yes, three top shelf insights, and I haven't reached the Christians yet. I'll deal with that in the next post. block-time published-time 3.57am BST  Bowen is asked why he's wagging parliament. (Because it suited me and the Canning campaign to visit today.) He's then asked what he thinks of the China FTA. (He likes the FTA but he thinks Tony Abbott should address Labor's concerns like John Howard did in 2004.) He's then asked whether he'll guarantee jobs when the carbon tax comes back. (We believe in investing in renewable energy to create jobs.) block-time published-time 3.47am BST  Meanwhile, going west. enltrChris Bowen always looks like he's just missed out on the last muffin at his favourite cafe.

The good people of Canning can send Tony Abbott a message that they don't care for that by voting for Labor's candidate. Bowen:  He'll be a great member of parliament, an important addition to an already great delegation from Western Australia with the senators. We need a strong voice for Canning in Canberra, in the Labor team. A strong voice in the next Labor government standing up for the people of Western Australia. block-time published-time 3.37am BST   Plibersek says no to ground troops in Syria  Labor's deputy leader Tanya Plibersek is being interviewed on Sky News. She says she'll be briefed later today by officials about the Syrian military deployment. She says the humanitarian response and the ultimate political solution is far more important in Syria than the military campaign. Plibersek is asked whether Labor would support the deployment of ground troops. No, I don't think Australia should be sending troops into Syria. She says Australia should not become involved in Syria militarily, given the risks of being drawn into a proxy war for control of Syria between Russia and Iran and other players. Q: But we are involved, militarily? Plibersek says we aren't. Australia is proposing to conduct airstrikes in Syria as part of the defence of Iraq. She's then asked about Scott Morrison's insistence that Christian minorities will make up the bulk of the refugee cohort. I think we need to look after the most vulnerable people. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.38am BST block-time published-time 3.19am BST  A few questions on the China free trade deal. Q: Some unions have said you have to renegotiate with Beijing. Do you think concerns can be addressed to a satisfactory level without renegotiating the free trade agreement?  Brendan O'Connor:  It would be really good if Tony Abbott sat down with Bill Shorten and Penny Wong and Andrew Robb and we worked these things through. block-time published-time 3.15am BST  O'Connor is asked about the reasoning from the mysterious government officials (the ones who erroneously told some news outlets that unemployment was going to increase this month) - that a change in the jobless rate relates to the changes in Newstart rules forcing unemployed people to undertake short training courses to apply for up to 20 jobs a month. He thinks this is an alibi, and an overstated one at that. block-time published-time 3.06am BST  Labor's employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor is first to the open microphone on the jobless figures. He says any unemployment rate with a six in front of it is too high. What we have here is an unemployment rate that is still very high. block-time published-time 3.02am BST  Some press conferences coming up shortly on the new unemployment number. In the interim, for completeness, here is what the prime minister said this morning in Moresby when asked about the Morrison comments about Christians. Q: Prime minister, Scott Morrison says Australia will resettle persecuted minorities which will mainly be Christians. Do you agree that they should mainly be Christians?  Tony Abbott:  Well, we're resettling persecuted minorities - people who cannot realistically ever hope to return. Now, there are many persecuted minorities in Syria and in Iraq, many persecuted minorities in the Middle East. There are persecuted Muslim minorities, there are persecuted non-Muslim minorities, and we are looking to resettle the members of persecuted minorities who can never realistically expect to go back to their homes. Some will be Muslim, some will be Christian, but the point is: these are people who have been displaced by war and because of the changes engulfing the Middle East, it's unlikely that they will ever, ever be able to go back. The Morrison comment, this morning, again for completeness.  Scott Morrison:  This is a diabolical proposition for many of those communities and it does go across all faiths and religions, no doubt, but I think there can be no question about the fact that the persecuted minorities which are predominantly Middle Eastern Christians are those who face the bleakest long term prospects in that region. block-time published-time 2.33am BST  The officials kind enough to brief certain news outlets about the bad unemployment number appear to have been chicken littles. The rate has dropped from 6.3% to 6.2%. The Australian's news report said the government expectation was (potentially) a 13 year high of 6.5%. This is distinctly odd. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.36am BST block-time published-time 2.23am BST  Bit of feedback from the audience about the wonderful rudeness of Leigh Sales.  enltr @murpharoo I'm fairly anti-Abbott but I thought that Leigh Sales went pretty hard and interrupted Abbott a lot. - Shay Lattimer (@Neckron666) September 10, 2015 enltr @murpharoo 7.30 was the usual. @leighsales would ask PM an Q on economy.

Let's work through this issue step by step. Earlier this week, there was a big push on from various conservative types in the government that any new one-off refugee intake from Syria should prioritise Christians. Regular readers will remember that the government senate leader, Eric Abetz, described Christians as the most persecuted religious group in the world. The prime minister was very careful yesterday to convey the idea that the government would not pursue a discriminatory policy. The government would look to bring in vulnerable people: women, children, families and persecuted minorities regardless of their religious stripe. But Morrison is powering on with the idea the new arrivals will be ""predominately Middle Eastern Christians."" Morrison did a press conference with reporters after his interview with the ABC this morning, and he said twice the group would be predominantly Christian.

I read in The Australian the government is ""bracing"" for a bad number, and government economic officials believe the jump in the jobless rate from 6 to 6.3% in July was the result of a change in Newstart rules that force unemployed people undertaking short training courses to apply for up to 20 jobs a month.

1912,src_theguardian_raw4.docx,The Guardian,30/11/2015,940 words,Ian Traynor in Brussels,Europe split over refugee deal as Germany leads breakaway coalition; Angela Merkel holds surprise mini-summit in Brussels with nine EU countries willing to take large numbers after meeting resistance to mandatory sharing scheme,"Months of European efforts to come up with common policies on mass immigration unravelled on Sunday when Germany led a ""coalition of the willing"" of nine EU countries taking in most refugees from the Middle East, splitting the union formally on the issues of mandatory refugee-sharing and funding. An unprecedented full EU summit with Turkey agreed a fragile pact aimed at stemming the flow of migrants to Europe via Turkey.  But the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, frustrated by the resistance in Europe to her policies, also convened a separate mini-summit with seven other leaders to push a fast-track deal with the Turks and to press ahead with a new policy of taking in and sharing hundreds of thousands of refugees a year directly from Turkey. The surprise mini-summit suggested that Merkel has given up on trying to persuade her opponents, mostly in eastern Europe, to join a mandatory refugee-sharing scheme across the EU, although she is also expected to use the pro-quotas coalition to pressure the naysayers into joining later. Merkel's ally on the new policy, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, said of the mini-summit: ""This is a meeting of those states which are prepared to take in large numbers of refugees from Turkey legally.""  Related: Hiding in plain sight: inside the world of Turkey's people smugglers But he added later that any such agreement would be voluntary and not binding, while the Dutch rejected German-led calls to resettle large numbers directly from Turkey. The frictions triggered by the split were instantly apparent. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council who chaired the full summit with Turkey, contradicted the mainly west European emphasis on seeing Ankara as the best hope of slowing the mass migration to Europe.  ""Let us not be naive. Turkey is not the only key to solving the migration crisis,"" said Tusk. ""The most important one is our responsibility and duty to protect our external borders. We cannot outsource this obligation to any third country. I will repeat this again: without control on our external borders, Schengen will become history."" He was referring to the 26-country free-travel zone in Europe, which is also in danger of unravelling under the strains of the migratory pressures and jihadist terrorism. Juncker said he would come up with a system for redistributing an annual ""contingent"" of refugees from Turkey among the coalition of the willing countries. Reports in Berlin put the figure at 400,000. He was expected to leave that until after the looming French regional elections for fear of boosting the chances of the anti-EU, anti-immigrant Front National of Marine Le Pen. Earlier, Turkey promised to help stem the flow of migrants to Europe in return for cash, visas and renewed talks on joining the EU. The Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, called it a ""new beginning"" for the uneasy neighbours. A key element is (EURO)3bn (£2.11bn) in EU aid for the 2.2 million Syrians now in Turkey. The money is intended to raise their living standards and so persuade more of them to stay put rather than attempt perilous crossings to the EU via the Greek islands. The final offer of ""an initial"" (EURO)3bn represents a compromise between the EU, which offered that sum over two years, and Turkey, which wanted it every year. The money will be paid out bit by bit as conditions are met, French president Francois Hollande said, leaving the total payout unclear.  ""As Turkey is making an effort to take in refugees - who will not come to Europe - it's reasonable that Turkey receive help from Europe to accommodate those refugees,"" Hollande told reporters.  He added that the deal should also make it easier to check migrants arriving and keep out those who pose a threat, like Islamic State militants who struck Paris two weeks ago.   Related: EU seeks to buy Turkish help with migrants at controversial summit Also on offer to Ankara, which wants to revive relations with its European neighbours after years of coolness, is a ""re-energised"" negotiating process on Turkish membership of the EU, even if few expect it to join soon.  Many Turks could also benefit from visa-free travel to Europe's Schengen zone within a year if Turkey meets conditions on tightening its borders in the east to Asian migrants and moves other benchmarks on reducing departures to Europe.  ""Today is a historic day in our accession process to the EU,"" Davutoglu told reporters on arrival. ""I am grateful to all European leaders for this new beginning.""  David Cameron said: ""This summit matters because we need a comprehensive solution to the migrant crisis in Europe and obviously that involves Turkey. ""Britain will continue to play our role, which is about supporting Syrian refugees in the refugee camps and in Turkey. ""In terms of the discussions this afternoon, a lot of it will be about the Schengen no borders zone that we're not a member of. Britain in the European Union will keep our border controls, vital to our security that they are."" After the summit, Cameron held talks with Tusk on Britain's renegotiation with the EU. Downing Street said: ""They agreed that we continue to make good progress. While some areas are more difficult than others, discussions are ongoing with member states to find solutions and agree reforms in all four areas outlined in the PM's letter to the European Council president. ""These discussions will continue in the coming days, including with bilaterals between the PM and other European leaders in Paris tomorrow, and all EU leaders will have a substantive discussion of the UK renegotiation at next month's European council as planned.""",Broadsheet,0,2015-11,1,Policy

""All you need to do is put yourself in our shoes,"" he said. ""If you put yourself in our shoes and think about what we went through and think about your children going through this, you might sympathise and understand what it is we really want."" Speaking at an event organised by the Varkey Foundation and Safe Passage UK - which was set up to help the safe and legal entry of unaccompanied child refugees to the UK - 17-year-old Kabir made a plea for unaccompanied minors to be accepted into society. ""I am not here by choice, I am here because of war,"" he said. ""I hope that this country will welcome us with open arms and not with racism and hate. If there is one thing I want to happen in these governmental chambers is that you open a file called chance for syrian refugees to be integrated - all the refugee children, not just the Syrians."" The immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, last week said 318 minors had been brought to the UK, 60 of whom were girls. Of these, 200 - like the teenagers speaking at the event - were brought in under a family reunification programme mandated by the Dublin regulation in EU law, with the remainder transferred under the Dubs amendment.

The Home Office came under attack last week after new, highly restrictive eligibility criteria for child refugees hoping to be transferred from France to Britain were revealed. The rules exclude 16- and 17-year-olds of all nationalities from consideration for transfer to Britain under the Dubs amendment of the Immigration Act.

Related: 'We suffer the same as them': the trauma and despair of Syrians detained on Nauru Twenty-nine-year-old Eyad* nominated to be voluntarily returned to Syria from Manus last month so he could help his wife and meet his baby daughter, born while he was in detention.  Reunited with his family in his home city of al-Harra, Eyad says he has had to leave his bombed-out home - destroyed in fighting between the al-Assad regime and separatist fighters - and is now living in the abandoned home of a friend who has fled the country. Through intermediaries he said: ""I am so tired and the situation here getting more worse every day. Dead bodies everywhere. I really need help [because] I could not find anyone here to help me nor when I was on Manus. Even the International Organisation for Migration weren't not able to send me back. ""But the Australian government wasn't have any problem to send me back to this danger. My house has destroyed completely and I am living in my friend's house [because] he's out Syria now. ""If there is help for me and a way of getting us to Australia with the people they are taking [the 12,000 Australia has promised to resettle], I wish for that."" A fellow refugee, still on Manus said: ""Eyad couldn't stay here more and his family in danger there. He told me I preferred to die with them, better than to stay in Manus. His daughter was born when he was in Manus and he never saw her, just on picture."" Eyad fled Syria in 2013 after he was imprisoned by the al-Assad regime. He arrived on Christmas Island by boat on 8 August 2013 and was moved to Manus Island less than a month later, on 5 September. In a letter he wrote in April 2014 he said he had fled his home promising to find a safe place for his family. ""I want to tell you my story, about in Syria and about civil war and the crime of killing innocent people in Syria - I came out because of this. And I thought to find a peaceful place and I promised my wife to find a place to live peacefully."" But after nearly two years in detention, and having been recognised as a refugee who faced "" a well-founded fear of persecution "" in his homeland, he grew increasingly concerned about the fate of his wife - from whom he had not heard - and their child and agreed to go home. On 19 August this year he nominated to be voluntarily returned to Syria from Manus Island. His repatriation was controversial. The immigration department has consistently gone to extensive lengths to persuade Syrian asylum seekers to return to the country, even as the conflict there worsened.  The International Organisation for Migration refuses to be involved in any removals to Syria, saying the risks to those returned are too high. The organisation has not taken part in the return of Syrians from other countries since 2012, according to its latest report, so the Australian immigration department stepped in to repatriate Eyad. The return of asylum seekers to Syria - even on a voluntary basis - has also sparked concern because Australia's immigration department will generally contact the Syrian embassy or consulate to arrange travel documents for them, alerting the government to their impending return.  Even as it flew Eyad back to Syria, the Australian government was warning that the situation in the country was deteriorating rapidly. Less than a fortnight after his return, the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the conflict in Iraq and Syria was ""a very grave situation"". ""People in Syria are caught between the mass execution of the Daesh [Islamic State] death cult on the one hand and the chemical weapons of the Assad regime on the other,"" he said. ""It is important that there be a humanitarian response.""  Related: Abbott praised for Syrian refugee intake amid calls to spell out military exit strategy On 9 September, Abbott announced Australia would resettle 12,000 refugees from Syria, in addition to its annual humanitarian program of 13,750.

""There is no difference between Eyad, the Syrians still imprisoned offshore, and the 12,000 that will be accepted permanently,"" she said. ""A genuinely humanitarian response would see Manus and Nauru shut and all, including Syrian refugees, brought to Australia for permanent resettlement."" The Australian government has committed to settling 12,000 Syrian refugees, currently living in camps in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon. Health and security checks have already begun on the first cohort of 200 refugees. The government hopes some can be resettled in Australia by Christmas.

Legal experts, meanwhile, warn that many governors' positions exceed their state power.  At least 15 states have expressed resistance to accepting Syrian refugees attempting to flee their country's civil war, and the list is rapidly expanding. Several governors are working to prevent refugee resettlement in their state directly, while other governors and several members of Congress are urging federal action.   Related: Obama savages Republican calls to give priority to Christian refugees from Syria Michigan's governor, Rick Snyder, was among the first to initiate the resistance campaign, suspending his state's Syrian refugee resettlement program. The move was an about-face for the governor, who had held out his state as a haven for resettling refugees, particularly those from Syria. The governor's spokeswoman, Sara Wurfel, said: ""[The] Governor is not saying we won't accept refugees - just suspending until complete review of clearance procedures is complete to ensure safety & security.""  But Rashida Tlaib, a former state representative and current manager of the Take on Hate campaign, said Snyder's suspension of the refugee program sends a perverse message, ""especially because these are the same families that had the courage to stand up against these same attackers, against this sort of violence"". ""We in Michigan are at the forefront of making sure we're able to [resettle refugees and] at the same time making sure we're OK, making sure we're secure,"" Tlaib said.  Dr Muzammil Ahmed, chairperson of the Michigan Muslim Majority Council, said the group was ""disappointed"" by Snyder's ""very knee-jerk"" decision. The governor has been ""great to work with, he has a very comprehensive vision when it comes to immigrants"", Ahmed said. But, he added, the suspension of relocation efforts across the US will only fuel the narrative from Isis of ""us versus them"". ""We strongly oppose this narrative,"" Ahmed told the Guardian. ""We feel one of the biggest victims of Isis is other Muslims. And the Syrian refugees are fleeing Isis and the terrorist activities that they have initiated. So I think that the governor's action just reinforced the narrative in people's mind that Isis wants to have."" Snyder told reporters on Monday that he would not seek to stop the nearly two dozen Syrian refugees already en route to Michigan. By Monday, the list of states expressing hesitation about accepting Syrians had grown exponentially to include Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Florida, Ohio, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Maine, Wisconsin, Arizona and Indiana.   The chairman of the US House of Representatives homeland security committee, Michael McCaul, also called on Obama to suspend plans to admit Syrian refugees into the US. And Senator Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, introduced a bill to impose a moratorium on refugees from up to 30 countries with jihadist movements, including Syria.  Governor Greg Abbott of Texas went so far as to say in a letter to President Obama: ""I write to inform you that the State of Texas will not accept any refugees from Syria in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in Paris."" Ian Millhiser, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, argued that Abbott has exceeded the limits of federal law, and cannot refuse to accept Syrian refugees.  ""The problem for Jindal, Abbott and the other governors opposed to admitting refugees ... is that there is no lawful means that permits a state government to dictate immigration policy to the president in this way,"" he wrote for ThinkProgress.  Abbott's letter to Obama also conflates Isis with Syrian refugees. He wrote:   ""The threat posed to Texas by ISIS is very real. ISIS claimed credit last May when two terrorist gunmen launched an attack in Garland, Texas. Less than two weeks later, the FBI arrested an Iraqi-born man in North Texas and charged him with lying to federal agents about traveling to Syria to fight with ISIS. And in 2014, when I served as Texas attorney general, we participated in a Joint Terrorism Task Force that arrested two Austin residents for providing material support to terrorists - including ISIS.""  Isis claimed responsibility for the Garland attack, but the two gunmen were not Syrians. They had been living in Phoenix, Arizona. One was born in Illinois and the other in Texas. As for the two Austin residents cited in Abbott's letter, one was a Houston native and the other a Bangladesh-born US citizen who was a student at the University of Texas. ""This is all just a reaction out of fear as opposed to taking into account people's individual stories,"" said Mohammad Abdollahi, a spokesman for Raices, a Texas-based group that provides legal aid to refugees, including some Syrians. ""[Abbott] just fundamentally doesn't understand the issue of why they're fleeing violence."" In Alabama, which has not accepted a Syrian refugee to date, the Republican governor, Robert Bentley, dug his feet in and said none will resettle there any time soon. ""As your governor,"" he wrote, ""I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way."" Monsignor Michael Farmer, who heads a Catholic group called the Refugee Resettlement Program, seemed nonplussed by Bentley's announcement. ""The word is out there, somehow, that we have Syrians coming here, and we don't,"" he said.  But immigration is an ongoing, politically charged issue in Alabama, which in 2011 passed the nation's toughest immigration law, essentially driving undocumented immigrants from the state.  On Monday, Saraí Portillo, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, warned against conflating a fear of terrorism with a general disapproval of immigrants.  ""We must be guided by our values and not our fear,"" she wrote, ""and offer refuge to innocent families in crisis. We should work towards an equal and fair treatment of all immigrants and refugees regardless of race, religion, national origin or sexual orientation."" Not every US state sealed its borders on Monday. Governors in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Vermont said they would accept refugees. In Pennsylvania, Governor Tom Wolf's spokesperson told PennLive.com that, despite the attacks in Paris and Beirut, ""we must not lose sight of the fact that families leaving Syria are trying to escape the same violence and unimaginable terror that took place in Paris and Beirut"". The spokesperson added: ""Pennsylvania will continue working with the federal government to ensure that all individuals have gone through the proper screening process."" Observers in Michigan said the US has to play a role in addressing the influx of refugees streaming out of Syria - and that mechanisms already exist to ensure they are screened properly. ""It's clearly a knee-jerk reaction. The Department of Homeland Security already has matters in place to screen Syrian refugees - which include orphans - thus making Governor Snyder's point moot,"" said Dawud Walid, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Michigan chapter.

Related: Syrian refugee crisis: why has it become so bad? A specially dedicated Kickstarter page launched on Tuesday morning invites donors to make tax-deductible contributions to help Syrian refugees, with all proceeds going to the US Association of the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The fundraising site will feature video reportage by the Guardian on the refugees' plight.  The project took off after the White House contacted Kickstarter, known for crowdfunding creative projects, two weeks ago to talk about new ways to get the US public involved in the Syrian relief effort, said Kickstarter's CEO, Yancey Strickler. ""I immediately said yes,"" Strickler said. ""This is not something that we have ever done before. We have always kept the platform focused strictly on creative projects. ""But in this instance, it's a call from the White House. And feeling, like a lot of people, overwhelmed by the immensity of this situation, we felt compelled to act, and felt like if our product could provide any path forward for the people, we should do that."" The UN refugee agency welcomed the partnership as a potentially powerful new tool in providing relief to hundreds of thousands of refugees making their way into Europe from Syria and in intermediary refugee camps. The Syrian conflict has displace an estimated 11.6 million people in under five years. ""This is the first time we've had the opportunity to partner with a group like Kickstarter,"" said Anne-Marie Grey, executive director of USA for UNHCR. ""This is a terrific opportunity, and it's a very different group of people than would normally raise their hands to support refugee causes, so it's really quite exciting."" Donations will go toward the purchase and distribution of life-saving equipment including tents; emergency rescue kits including water, food, and warm clothing; sleeping bags, thermal mattresses, sleeping mats, and other lifesaving essentials; and foster care and counselling. The material will be delivered to refugee camps and communities around Syria, and to refugees traveling from various points into Europe. An estimated half a million refugees from the Syrian conflict have arrived in Europe this year, and 800,000 or more are expected by year's end. About 51% of the refugees are women and children, Grey said. ""These are people like you and me,"" she said. ""The statistics are huge, but we've got to remember that these are individual human beings, and this is about humanity.""  Unlike other Kickstarter projects, the project to help Syrian refugees does not have an all-or-nothing funding goal. All donations in any amount will be accepted. Backers will be charged as soon as they donate. Kickstarter plans to donate its usual 5% fee to the refugee agency. In its six-plus years in business, Kickstarter has raised nearly $2bn for creative projects from some 10 million unique backers. About a third of those are repeat donors.

In his first annual state of the union address before the European parliament in Strasbourg, Juncker urged member states to accept the commission's plan to relocate 160,000 refugees fleeing war and terror.  Related: Refugee crisis: Juncker unveils EU quota plan - live updates Juncker acknowledged that the numbers of people arriving in Europe was ""frightening"" for some, but declared: ""Now is not the time for fright, this is time for bold, concerted action. It is a matter of humanity and dignity, for Europe it is a matter for historical fairness."" Recalling past waves of migration, Juncker reminded his audience that Europe was the world's wealthiest and most stable continent. ""We have the means to help those fleeing war and terror. There is certainly an unprecedented number of refugees, but it is just 0.11% of Europe's population. Refugees represent 25% of Lebanon's population,"" said Juncker. He urged EU member states to adopt the commission's proposal to increase the relocation scheme from 40,000 to 160,000 migrants in Italy, Greece and Hungary at a summit of interior ministers later this month. ""We can build walls and fences,"" said Juncker. ""But imagine for a second if it were you, your children in your arms, the world you know torn apart around you. There is no price you would not pay, no wall you would not climb, no sea you would not go to sea in, no border you would not cross."" On commission plans to relocate 160,000, Juncker insisted that this be done on a compulsory basis.  ""We call on members states to accept 160,000. That's the number Europeans to have to take in their arms. I hope this time everybody will be on board. Action is needed this time,"" he said. Earlier, Juncker said the EU had to manage the refugee crisis because there was no alternative. ""There has been too much finger pointing in past weeks, member states accusing each other of not doing enough, of doing the wrong thing and accusations that Brussels is not doing its job. We could all be angry in this blame game, but who would that serve,"" he said. Heckled at one point by British MEPs, Juncker broke off to address them directly. ""You can interrupt me from time to time,"" he said. ""I will not at each time respond to what you are saying because what you are saying is worthless."" It was thought his rebuke was aimed at Nigel Farage, but the Ukip leader claimed it was directed at David Coburn, the leader of Ukip Scotland. Juncker, whose proposals face opposition from some governments, also pledged to improve the management of the bloc's external frontiers, bolster its Frontex border agency and take steps toward the creation of European coastguard and border guard systems. He proposed a ""more effective approach to return"", addressing complaints that too many people not entitled to asylum enter the European Union illegally and remain there, often despite legal proceedings that conclude they should return home. He called for efforts to strengthen the EU's common asylum system and a scheduled review of the so-called Dublin system, among whose rules is that people must claim asylum in the state where they first enter the EU, which have strained resources in frontline countries, particularly Greece and Hungary. In response to criticism from refugee and migration agencies, Juncker said the EU would ""develop safe legal avenues for those in need of protection"" - reducing the temptation to risk dangerous sea crossings and smuggling networks - as well as a permanent scheme to resettle refugees from other regions and better protection for refugees living in regions neighbouring Europe. He also renewed a proposal to review the system by which workers can apply to migrate to the EU, addressing concerns on an ageing continent that it needs to attract new people. The detailed proposals are likely to provoke renewed disagreement among EU states and between national leaders and the EU executive. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, whose government has taken in the largest number of asylum seekers, has called on poorer eastern neighbours who receive German-funded EU subsidies to show solidarity - and warned that the Schengen system of open borders from which they benefit is under threat from chaotic movements of migrants across the bloc. On Tuesday, she said the 160,000 figure might not be enough, and warned that Europe may have to accept even bigger numbers. While the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, remains opposed to relocation quotas, his country will benefit from the scheme, having already taken in tens of thousands. Under Juncker's plan, EU sources say Poland would be asked to take in nearly 12,000, up from a current figure of 2,000. Britain has been critical of the EU approach but is exempt from the bloc's asylum policies and will not take part. David Cameron, the UK prime minister, has said the UK would accept up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over five years. Spain, which had complained that its likely quota is too high, said on Tuesday it was ready to take what the EU allocated. ",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,1,Policy

A last-ditch effort to keep the 58-year-old man, known as Saeed, in Australia failed on Sunday night.  Saeed, a member of a persecuted minority, fled Iraq with his brother and arrived in Australia 2012. The brother was granted asylum but Saeed was not, prompting a series of protests.  Saeed's lawyer, Alison Battisson from Human Rights for All, was given no notice before his deportation on Sunday night. Battisson said Saeed is weak, weighing less than 50kg, has no money and is illiterate. He is not from a major city and will have little support upon arrival in Iraq.  Related: Iraqi and Syrian refugees will be settled in Armidale from next year Battisson said his prospects were bleak.  ""[They are] very, very low. He's not sophisticated, he's from a minority group, he's poor. He's always been very poor,"" she told Guardian Australia.  ""If he's alive in a couple of years, I'd be very surprised."" Saeed had been in detention for four years. A number of arrests were made when activists disrupted an attempt to deport him from Melbourne in March.  Saeed was instead taken to Villawood in Sydney, and went on hunger strike. He has been on hunger strike periodically since the move.  ""It's his health which is the main concern, and the treatment that he needs, I just can't imagine will be easily accessible in Iraq,"" Battisson said. ""He's not from the capital, he's not from a major city.""  Battison said she had been preparing one final appeal, directly to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to grant Saeed a visa on compassionate grounds. The late-night deportation rendered that appeal useless, she said. She said immigration authorities appeared to have arranged Saeed's deportation to avoid similar scenes to those in March.  A protester, upon learning of the deportation on Sunday, bought a plane ticket so he could get through immigration and hand leaflets to other passengers on Saeed's flight, she said.  The protester was not able to buy a ticket on Saeed's flight, she said, but encouraged other passengers to delay the trip.  Saeed's application for asylum was rejected on administrative grounds, according to Battisson, who blamed poor legal representation. She said a recent administrative appeals tribunal judgment had found another man, from the same minority and region as Saeed, had been granted asylum over fears of persecution.  ""The process has failed him,"" she said. ",Broadsheet,0,2017-08,0,Conditions

For the past few years, the Columbus Blue Jackets forward has watched as his relatives left war-torn Syria to make a safer life for themselves in the United States.   ""It's definitely an eye-opener with them coming over and getting adjusted to the lifestyle and the new language and things like that,"" he tells the Guardian. ""It definitely puts things in perspective for you.""   Saad traces his Syrian roots through his father, George, who was born in Syria and came to the United States at 18. He speaks glowingly of the way his father's hard work has served as an inspiration. George received two degrees from Columbia and the University of Pittsburgh, became a US citizen, and settled in Pittsburgh, where Saad was born. But many of George's brothers and sisters were left behind in Syria, which descended into a civil war in 2011.   Related: Syria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting The US branch of the Saads feared for the safety of their relatives back in Syria as the country descended into one of the largest humanitarian crisis in recent memory, and they started the process of moving as many family members as possible to the United States.  ""Most of them are over here now and the ones that aren't here yet they're safe back home,"" says Saad. ""So really no issues there, everything's been good with that so that's always good to hear.""  Saad's uncles and aunts now live in Pittsburgh near his family, which has made the transition easier. Saad says his father has been help them settle in, relying on his experiences from the time he was a newly arrived immigrant. Saad - with the money that comes with an NHL career - has been able to help out on the financial side by sponsoring some of his relatives. Saad, whose maternal grandfather was an NFL official, grew up playing hockey and football before he made a career on the ice. After two Stanley Cups in four years with the Chicago Blackhawks, he was traded to the Blue Jackets, who rewarded him with a six-year contract worth $36m.   ""You try to help out as much as you can. My dad has worked hard to be successful so he can help them as well. But any way I can help I'm always here for them,"" Saad says. ""They know that. I've gotten pretty close with them over the short period of time.""  His Syrian family's arrival has also been an opportunity for Saad to expose them to hockey, a sport they didn't know much about. It's been a bonding experience, as Saad had not met any of his relatives in person, and only got to know them over Skype.  ""They've become huge fans of the sport and love watching me play,"" he says. ""It's pretty funny to interact and kind of see them see things for the first time. They've definitely all taken an interest in it because of me.""  Following the Paris terrorist attacks last November, the Syrian refugee crisis became a political football as figures such as Donald Trump urged a halt to the immigration process. However, it's not a debate Saad is willing to wade into. ""You hear about it,"" he says. ""For the most part, it is what it is and I just focus on playing hockey and hopefully the family's safely here through my dad. That's pretty much all you care about and all you can control.  Saad has only taken one trip to Syria, when he was a young child but he hopes that some day, when there is peace, he can make the journey as an adult. ""It's a beautiful country and I'd love to go back and see where my dad is from,"" Saad says. ""So I think that would be a great trip."" ",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,1,Migration
2088,src_theguardian_raw4.docx,The Guardian,6/5/2014,1116 words,Martin Chulov in Bekaa Valley,Middle East: Syria's lost generation learns the hard way: Lebanon's refugee schools are doing what they can to make up for lost time,"Each morning at 8am, Ahmed stirs from his blanket on the soil and walks about a mile to the morning shift. Sometimes his two sisters go with him. More children soon join him from nearby potato fields and tents, on their way to the first of the day's three school sessions. A second wave of small children carrying oversized blue school bags appears at noon, and another in the late afternoon. Ahmed is usually met with a bear hug from a Lebanese social worker, Maria, who for the past two years has been part social worker, part disciplinarian and, more often than not, mother figure for him and the other Syrian children who attend this makeshift school house in the heart of the Bekaa Valley. All the children are refugees, most have lost at least one parent, and every one has a story of deprivation and loss. But all seems to be forgotten for a few hours in this school among the crops and tents where the children of war come to learn. Syria's civil war is trampling on its children as easily as it is killing its adults. The 400,000 child refugees now in Lebanon represent a lost generation; many who have fled here have been denied an education for three years. Poverty is not their only constraint. Until recently, enrolling Syrian refugees in Lebanese schools was close to impossible, and getting any form of education at all was almost as difficult. Things are slowly changing for some. Since early this year, the Lebanese government has allowed double shifts in state primary schools, meaning refugee children can attend the second shift in some schools. Syrians enrolled in the Lebanese system receive formal qualifications when they graduate. But not all are as fortunate. Schools such as Ahmed's are considered informal and not recognised by the government. Syrian teachers are allowed to teach here, but they must stick to a Lebanese curriculum and, at the end of the year, the progress of children is not recognised. That means they cannot advance to secondary schools or be accepted into the state system. For the eager students in this school though, it clearly doesn't matter. A group aged between five and eight are sitting outside around a table as their teacher, a businessman from Homs who lost his home and livelihood two years ago, teaches them how to paint. ""Life was different before this,"" he says. ""But I have found dignity in the therapy of art. I love these children."" The children watch in silence as he etches small white geese on to a landscape on a wood panel. Then all the children take turns, including Fatima, whose mother died during a winter storm four months ago and who, like Ahmed, receives extra attention from the always-hovering Maria. So enthusiastic are children to learn that the school sometimes runs triple shifts. They are often greeted by a traditional storyteller. Dressed in a gown and a red box hat known as a tarboush, his role is to maintain a connection between the children and their lost land just across the border. ""He talks about the streets and the castles, the rivers and the marketplaces,"" said Maria. ""The children love it. And we also give them a lot of psycho-social support to help them learn to love their new country."" The storyteller also plays another role, often drifting into the fraught issues of geography and modern history. Even primary school children seem well aware that who did what in the Levant before the war is a touchy subject. Since March 2011, the narrative has been more bitterly contested than ever. Both the storyteller and the teachers receive $6 (about £3.50) an hour. Most live among their students in the informal refugee camps that dot the area. Ahmed lives in one of them with his five siblings. His older brother Nimr, 15, is acting as head of the family, and takes the lead in caring for Kamel, who has not been the same since he pulled his mother's body from the rubble of their family home in Idblib early last year. Shortly afterwards, the family's father, Mohammed, drove his five children to the Lebanese border, waved them goodbye, then left. They have not heard from him since, and have long ago used the small amount of money they had to rent a tent space and buy food. ""We ran away from problems and problems followed us,"" said Nimr, squatting on the floor of the tent he now shares with his new wife, Fatima, also 15. ""It would have been better if we all died with my mother. It would have been easier,"" he said. Fatima's family, who live in the camp, have helped the young orphans with a concrete path and food. Kamel nodded, but said nothing, his eyes fixed permanently on the middle distance. ""I feel I am not up to this responsibility,"" said Nimr, pointing at his siblings. ""I cannot feed them."" He holds up a debt book with a long list of IOUs that he cannot possibly repay. His youngest sister, Hala, sits restlessly alongside him, a cropped hat covering what hair she has left; the rest has fallen out in recent months. Hala, 11, used to go to school with Ahmed, but was bullied because of her appearance and behaviour. Her distress is not as visible as Kamel's but is never far away. Hala too runs for Maria when she appears in the tent's doorway, clinging to the leg of the surrogate mother who tries to entice her back to school. ""Lots of these children have suffered so much,"" she said. ""The stories they all tell are heart-breaking. All of them."" The scale of suffering faced by Syria's children is a reflection of a society in terminal decline. More than 150,000 people have been killed since the war began, and close to half the country's 22 million population is now on the move; at least 6.5 million are internally displaced, and almost 3 million have made it into neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq, where staying alive takes precedence over learning. Nonetheless, the fear of a lost generation is an increasingly dominant theme among humanitarian bodies which are having more luck reaching vulnerable communities who have made it to exile than in reaching those left behind. ""We need to prevent losing a whole generation of children from Syria. Giving them opportunities to learn, developing their skills and healing the wounds of the conflict is vital for the future of these children and for Syria,"" a Unicef spokesperson said. ""Children who have fled Syria to Lebanon have witnessed and experienced things no child should. But despite the suffering, children have an amazing ability to recover and heal. They want to learn - they want a better future.""

Just weeks after Merkel responded to the refugee crisis with the declaration: ""Wir schaffen es - We can do it"" - the euphoric mood has been replaced by a more sombre response with the realisation that the newcomers are here to stay, with all the consequences that entails. School authorities are calling for at least 25,000 new teaching recruits to cope with the large numbers of new pupils, police officers are being brought out of retirement in their thousands, and the nation is being scoured for suitable accommodation as winter approaches.  Related: Germany greets refugees with help and kindness at Munich central station ""The welcome parties in Munich, Berlin and elsewhere were great,"" said the Munich-based Süddeutsche Zeitung in a recent editorial. ""They showed a generous and open Germany of which we can be very proud, headed by a chancellor who seemed to surprise herself with her response, (and) tens of thousands of volunteers... but now we're in the stark light of day which consists of overcrowded refugee centres and local authorities and police stretched to their limits."" Arson attacks on refugee shelters continue on an almost daily basis. Reports of refugees being greeted at the doors of their new homes by neo-Nazis humming Third Reich songs or being pelted with banana skins are not uncommon. There are mounting concerns that elements of the far-right have found new oxygen in the crisis by tapping into ordinary people's fears that Europe's largest economy may be unable to cope with the decision to allow so many to take refuge within its borders. Latest estimates, so far unconfirmed by the government, are that Germany might expect as many as 1.5 million refugees by the end of the year, mostly from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. There are no signs the numbers will let up in the near future, with one government minister warning this week that many women and children can be expected to follow the males who made up the majority of those making the journey first. Merkel's decision last month to ""open the doors"", particularly to Syrian refugees, has attracted growing criticism even within her own party as an estimated 10,000 people continue to arrive every day. ""Over two days that's the same amount that the British prime minister, David Cameron, said Britain would take over a five-year period,"" a television presenter recently pointed out in an almost throw-away remark. The issue will be central to talks between Merkel and Cameron when they meet at Chequers on Friday. On Wednesday, 34 local officials from Merkel's Christian Democrats party wrote her a letter in which they voiced their concerns that her refugee policy had gone too far.  Related: Angela Merkel defends Germany's handling of refugee influx ""The open borders policy we are now implementing is not in line with either European or German law, nor does it reflect the CDU's programme,"" they wrote. None of the signatories holds a particularly significant position in the party. But their angry appeal amounts to the biggest party rebellion Merkel has ever faced. And the fact that they have voiced the anxieties of those on the frontline of this refugee crisis - the communities across Germany who say they are struggling to cope - will mean they can hardly be ignored. The chancellor's popularity ratings have taken an unusual hit, particularly in the former communist east where anti-immigrant sentiment is at its highest. But appearing on a television chat show on Wednesday night, Merkel insisted she would not try to limit the influx. ""How should that work?"" she asked the presenter. ""You cannot just close the borders."" Earlier in the day she told the European parliament that the EU needed to overhaul its rules on immigration. But concerns are being expressed across the political landscape, with many from the Greens and Social Democrats divided between their party principles - which they have to admit are in line with Merkel's - and the daily reality of overstretched municipalities. Reports of a youth community project having to move out to make way for an asylum seeker shelter, or a woman living in local authority housing being forced to downsize so that her flat could be used by refugees are regularly making the headlines and stoking resentment. ""The message needs to reach the top, as to where the problems lie, and that we've reached a limit,"" Wolfgang Rzehak, of the Greens, who heads Bavaria's regional council recently told the daily TAZ. He described the particularly bizarre but real challenge of having on his doorstep the A8 motorway on which people smugglers have been regularly transporting refugees via the Balkans, Hungary and Austria, and leaving them at the side of the road.  Related: A laboratory for refugee politics: inside Passau, the 'German Lampedusa' ""Sometimes the smugglers arrive in the middle of the night and drop underage refugees off at the service station. The police call my child protection officer at 3am, who has to go to them, and if no accommodation can be found, he often ends up taking them home with him,"" he said. As everywhere from aircraft hangars to former offices of the Stasi are commandeered as shelters and even ordinary Germans are being asked to take refugees into their own homes, Hamburg, Bremen and other cities have said they will seize vacant commercial property from its owners as an emergency measure. Local authorities say their hands are tied. But they are only too aware of the danger of the refugee project backfiring badly if local communities feel they are being deprived of their sports halls or youth clubs for too long. Amid all the upheaval and uncertainty, Merkel has dismissed accusations that she reacted on a whim when she actively welcomed Syrians in particular to come to Germany.  On Wednesday she signalled the extent to which she remained committed to her refugee policy by making her own chief of staff the country's refugee tsar. Peter Altmaier, a burly man and a veteran member of the CDU, has effectively replaced Thomas de Maiziere, the interior minister, who was handling the refugee brief but had started to openly question Merkel's position. Her decision to elevate Altmaier effectively means that, just weeks after her first ever visit to an asylum seekers' home in her 10 years as chancellor, she has brought the refugee issue right into the heart of her chancellery. Responding to accusations that she had no coordinated plan, she has created a taskforce across the government, giving each ministry a specific area of responsibility, covering everything from transport to education, and has said the issue will be discussed prominently at every cabinet meeting. Just a couple of months ago it was the Greek crisis dominating her agenda. Now that is hardly ever spoken about. Reiterating her commitment in a half-hour radio interview with Deutschlandfunk last weekend, to mark 25 years of German reunification, Merkel insisted that, just as Germany had been capable of managing that huge task, it was wholly suited now to absorb and integrate the large numbers. ""We are willing to tackle the responsibility of integration,"" she said, ""and I appeal for us not to reject it - there's no point in that - but for us to take it on board... and then to shape it so that it grows into something that is of benefit to us all.""  Related: Where could the refugee families sleep? In the beer tent, of course The underlying message the government has sought to spread in the hope of keeping the debate on a positive trajectory is that Germany desperately needs migrants to fill a growing skills shortage in the workplace amid its own pending demographic crisis, owing to an ageing population and a chronically low birthrate. The average immigrant in Germany is a startling 29 years younger than the average German, who is 46. But, as Naika Foroutan, a social scientist and deputy head of the Berlin Institute for Empirical Integration and Migration Research (BIM), warned in the TAZ, ""the narrative that's being propagated that 'we need immigrants in order to secure our pensions', is too utilitarian. It will quickly crack at the first sign that immigrants are not in fact so useful according to our performance indicators. But they'll still be there - the children, the ageing, the traumatised, and what do we do with them then? Deport them?"" The Süddeutsche editorial also points to the complexities of a million or more people, almost none of whom speak German, trying to find a place in German society, let alone in the country's rigidly structured workplace. ""Well-educated engineers, doctors and economists are coming. But there are also plenty of illiterate people, stunned by their new world,"" wrote the paper's Matthias Drobinski. ""Ultra religious Muslims - and Christians - are coming face to face with a society that is indifferent to religion. Newcomers with rigid moral codices must learn to deal with the fact that in Germany gay people can openly kiss each other."" The challenges of integration are already much in evidence in the shelters, where reports emerge every day of clashes between residents. Some are triggered by petty rows over queuing for food or the toilet, or over privacy. ""It's little surprise when the shelters are often overcrowded, privacy is minimal and the majority of the people are young men, frustrated and with little to do,"" said one volunteer from one of the many charities that are largely responsible for running them. At LaGeSo, the State Office for Health and Social Services in Berlin, where refugees go to be registered, both the chaos and the tensions among the estimated 1,500 people waiting for their number to be called - some of whom had been there for 35 days, were keenly felt one day last week. ""I cannot even get into the queue where people are waiting to pull a number,"" said 61-year-old Ahmad Nasar from Syria, highlighting the chaos which officials have readily admitted is largely due to understaffing and bureaucrats overwhelmed by the extraordinary situation.  Related: Munich fears migrants and beer hunters may not mix well at Oktoberfest Nasar clutched a certificate from a dentist saying his false teeth were completely destroyed and needed to be replaced. In the rare instance that the door opened and someone's number was called, the waiting crowds erupted in a mix of both cheers and jeers. Twenty-nine-year-old Mohammad Kheir Al Mousa from Deir ez-Zor in Syria said he and his 26-year-old pregnant wife, Amera, were sleeping rough in the park opposite in order to ensure they were first in the queue in the mornings. They had been waiting for one month and had still not managed to register, he said. Four Afghan brothers who said they had worked as translators for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) but had been forced to flee from the Taliban; a nine-year-old Syrian girl called Hadig, her arm decked in loom bands, and 55-year-old Shah Mohamad Tagi, whose face had been badly burnt in a bomb attack on his native home town of Herat, Afghanistan, all told similar stories that underlined the sense of pandemonium. ""Angela Merkel invited us,"" said Tagi, through a fellow Afghan who spoke English. ""But now we're here, there's no sense of order. We don't know what's going on. No one's talking to us."" Jens Spahn, a leading member of the CDU and a highly popular politician with the potential to one day succeed Merkel as the party's head, is a subtle but intelligent critic of her embrace of refugees, as well as of what he calls the ""euphoric representation"" of the refugee situation in the media and public debate. ""There are only the extremes, the self-styled downright good guys and the rabble-rousing xenophobes, but nothing in between,"" he said recently.

The so-called Donald Trumps of the continent. Austria's leader Norbert Hofer pledged to ""stop the invasion of Muslims"" by building a fence on his nation's southern border. Antisemitism and Islamophobia are rampant - recent polling in Hungary found at least one third of the population disliked Jews - and attacks against migrants in Germany echo a dark past. Making matters worse, the European Union is working with some of the most despotic African regimes to stop people leaving in the first place. It's why recent comments by Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton, questioning the language, suitability and adaptability of new arrivals, were so tame compared to the reckless and inflammatory outbursts by countless international counterparts. But Dutton's comments aren't the main issue here - it's what successive Australian governments have imposed on refugees over the last two decades and a general public who are willing to support it.  Related: Fact check: was Peter Dutton right about 'illiterate' refugees 'taking jobs'? This is not to defend Dutton's statements but they were hardly extreme or even unusual when compared to current global trends. Outrage over Dutton obscures the fact that Australia is now an inspiration globally over its refugee policies. Dismissing Dutton won't change this grim reality. That's the scandal that bedevils 21st Australia: cruelty against asylum seekers dressed up as compassion and deterrence.  Dutton was savaged for his comments and I don't have any sympathy for his stance but it's worth asking why anybody takes seriously Labor party posturing over his rhetoric. After all, it was on their watch that the most extreme form of offshore processing of asylum seekers, on Nauru and Manus Island, was re-introduced.  Labor's immigration spokesman Richard Marles recently said that there was an ""absolute guarantee"" his party now marched in unison with Liberal party policy over refugees. This means indefinite detention on remote Pacific islands and trying to strike deals with autocratic regimes in the region to take desperate people languishing for years without hope. Australia is a lucky nation if Dutton and his dog-whistling is the worst speech it needs to endure. A recent Amnesty survey found Australia was one of the most welcoming nations in the world towards refugees once they were living in the community and yet this is incongruous with a lack of public outcry towards abuses by private operators against asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island.  If murder and rape doesn't generate genuine outrage, then sympathy is clearly in short supply. Words matter but actions are far more damaging to both Australia's reputation and moral core. Australia remains deeply unsure of its identity, still unhealthily tied to Britain and the US, while being a geographical, if not ideological, part of Asia. Australia has spent more than two decades finding new and ingenious ways to isolate, punish and attack boat arrivals and Dutton is simply the latest in a long list of advocates for the cause. Recall Phillip Ruddock as immigration minister in the late 1990s unleashing draconian conditions for asylum seekers. Today he's cute clickbait for Buzzfeed. Buildings walls and fences, both literally and rhetorically, is the curse of this age and Australia has been leading the way for years. Chastising Dutton is necessary but it will have little effect on ingrained Australian attitudes towards people arriving by boat who look, sound and think differently (most of whom are Muslims).  An Australian media with few non-white faces doesn't help. To bring change will require a thorough examination of why Australia, as a relatively young, post-colonial nation, has never had proper accounting of its dark past and an honest assessment of how it treats the most vulnerable in its society and the world. Dutton needs to lift his game if he wants to compete with the master of the genre, Donald Trump (now back-tracking on his earlier call to ban all Muslims entering the US despite it having huge public support ). Trump is surging across America, and is a real possibility to win the general election in November, because white populations are feeling angry and disillusioned.   Related: We have an old saying in the dog-whistle business... | First Dog on the Moon Much of the mainstream media has given Trump huge amounts of free publicity and airtime. CBS head Les Moonves says the Republican candidate is "" damn good "" for business. The corporate press is a cosy club who know Trump well and have indulged his attitudes for decades. When Trump, his fellow Republicans and media attack dogs damn Syrian refugees and Islam the result is surging Islamophobia. Living away from Australia has given me a different take on Dutton and the surrounding furore. I've been writing, investigating and campaigning on asylum seekers for over a decade and Dutton's comments were just business as usual for a country that long ago lost any moral high-ground on refugees.  After an outburst such as Dutton's, I regularly hear asylum seeker supporters say that Australia is ""better than this"". How so? There are few times in Australia's history when Canberra wasn't targeting one minority or the other. Although Australia is a remarkably successful multicultural nation (in some of the main cities, at least), it'll never sleep and dream easily until it finds its own independent path. It has a long way to go. ",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,0,Migration

Related: Australia urges Nauru to uphold rule of law and stop censorship In September, then prime minister Tony Abbott announced the government would resettle an extra 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq over and above the existing 13,750 annual quota for humanitarian visas, in response to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Middle East.  On Sunday, Dutton told ABC's Insiders program the government could increase the intake further. ""I think if we can demonstrate that we can get the security and health checks right and that we're bringing the right people, that I think people will have confidence in the program - perhaps at some point - extending depending on the circumstances in Syria,"" Dutton said. ""The government is open to further assistance, given that this situation will deteriorate but we need to first demonstrate that we can bring the 12,000 across."" States and territories were in a ""bidding war"" to resettle the refugees, Dutton said, adding refugees would be resettled in areas where they had existing connections, such as family and friends. Greens MP Adam Bandt said the indication of an intake of Syrian refugees was a ""welcome shift"" in rhetoric from the government, but urged Dutton to consider resettling Syrians and Iraqis currently languishing in Australian-run offshore detention centres. ""If Peter Dutton is serious about caring for people in trouble, then he should start at home, and say, let's let the people, who are currently in Australian detention, who fled Syria, out living in the community as well,"" he told reporters on Sunday. Dutton visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan earlier this week, a visit he said was ""confronting"".  Related: Kyrgyzstan reported as option to resettle refugees from Nauru and Manus ""In the camp there were 40,000 children and seeing kids run around in that environment is not a pleasant sight,"" he said on Sunday. ""Many of them have lost family members, people from their own villages, and obviously the camps are overflowing but the difficulty, of course, is that the situation is only going to get worse in Syria because there's no quick fix, no political outcome."" Dutton rejected suggestions the $1bn Australia spends keeping asylum seekers in offshore detention be better spent, insisting the detainees in Manus and Nauru were in better circumstances than those in the Zaatari camp. ""In the camp that I went into, there's raw sewage flowing down the streets, there's no electricity, people have open fire arrangements out in the camps,"" he said. ""We have an $11m hospital at the regional processing centre in Nauru, we've provided an additional $26m for the upgrade of the hospital on Nauru, we fly people down to either Australia or to Port Moresby for treatment at international hospitals. So it's a very different offering in terms of the way in which we provide services."" Dutton reiterated his view refugee advocates such as Amnesty International had an ideological opposition to offshore detention. He refused to deny claims in a recent Amnesty report that people smugglers were paid to turn boats around, arguing Australian officials acted within the law.  Dutton was asked repeatedly to rule out the payments by Insiders host, Barrie Cassidy, but would not. ""Are you saying point-blank they did not pay people smugglers?"" Cassidy asked.  ""No such evidence was provided in the report of any illegal action,"" Dutton said. ""I will use my own words instead of having them framed. I'm putting to you that the government operates within the law, we've done that consistently in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders.""

His Commons promise to take 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years is at the bottom end of expectations. It stands in sharp contrast to the French pledge of 24,000 places over the next two years. As the Labour MP and father of the house, Gerald Kaufman, angrily pointed out: ""The Germans took in 10,000 refugees in one day."" Cameron has deliberately spurned taking part in a much bigger EU scheme to resettle those in the camps in countries neighbouring Syria. He has also rejected playing any part in the expected EU request this week to relocate the estimated 160,000 refugees who have made it across the Mediterranean to Italy and Greece or through the Balkans to Hungary. With more than 4 million Syrians already living in UN camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey it is hard to see how Britain's own-brand resettlement scheme can make any significant difference to the situation. It will undoubtedly make a world of difference to the few thousand who are lucky enough to be named each year by a British official as among the most deserving of sanctuary in the UK. But all the signs are that Cameron is set to repeat the same mistakes made when the UK's vulnerable persons relocation scheme, as it is officially known, was set up in January last year. One major reason why only 216 people actually arrived in Britain by the end of June this year under the scheme was the difficulty of finding councils willing to host them. This was not due to any lack of political will. Big cities such as Manchester, Sheffield and Glasgow were only too willing to help. But the Home Office was only willing to guarantee funding for the refugees for one year while they have been given resettlement rights in Britain for five years. Cameron made clear in the small print of his statement that this funding situation has yet to improve. Yes, the money is to come from the international aid budget, but its rules only allow the government to fund the reception of refugees in the UK and that means it cannot last more than 12 months. As the Local Government Association was quick to warn after Cameron's statement, councils must not be left to pick up the pieces again ""when the funding runs out and the world's attention has moved on"". The home secretary and the communities secretary have been given a week to thrash out a solution in the midst of the toughest public spending squeeze for a generation.  Related: Refugee crisis: what can you do to help? But the existing scheme not only suffers from funding problems - it is also one of the most bureaucratic refugee resettlement schemes in the world. While the EU's resettlement programme relies on a nomination from the UN high commissioner for refugees, Britain's operates complex criteria which Cameron has indicated are about to become even more complicated. The existing scheme is designed to give priority to those who are victims of sexual violence or torture or are too elderly or disabled to live in the camps. Cameron made clear that he wants to expand those priorities to include orphaned children, Christians and Yazidis. No doubt it will be a few more days before the official review of these criteria is completed, further delaying the arrival of anybody under the scheme. In his Commons statement, Cameron made much of how Britain did not need to take part in the EU's programmes to provide international protection, saying they could only operate within the Schengen border-free zone. But as Ireland, which also has an exemption from EU asylum programmes, has shown by volunteering to take 1,800 Syrian refugees over the next two years, it is perfectly possible to take part in that coordinated European response if Cameron wanted to. The UNHCR has called for an end to Europe's fragmented response to the refugee crisis. France and Germany seem to recognise that a joint European approach is the only way to match the scale of that crisis. In a key test of European solidarity, when Germany is saying it cannot be expected to act alone, Britain has decided once again to sit it out on the sidelines. As the French president, Francois Hollande, put it on Monday : ""It's true that Britain is not in the Schengen area ... but that doesn't absolve it from making an effort in terms of solidarity,"" making clear there would be a price to be paid when Britain in turn demands 'solidarity' over reform of the EU.",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,0,Policy

The deteriorating conditions in Lebanon and Jordan, particularly the lack of food and healthcare, have become intolerable for many of the 4 million people who have fled Syria, driving fresh waves of refugees north-west towards Europe and aggravating the current crisis. Speaking to the Guardian, the UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said: ""If you look at those displaced by conflict per day, in 2010 it was 11,000; last year there were 42,000. This means a dramatic increase in need, from shelter to water and sanitation, food, medical assistance, education. ""The budgets cannot be compared with the growth in need. Our income in 2015 will be around 10% less than in 2014. The global humanitarian community is not broken - as a whole they are more effective than ever before. But we are financially broke.""  Recent months have seen severe cuts to food rations for Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan as well as for Somali and Sudanese refugees in Kenya. Darfuris living in camps in Chad have been warned that their rations may end completely at the end of the year. UN-run healthcare services have also been closed across a large part of Iraq, leaving millions of internally displaced people without access to healthcare.  Guterres warned that the damage being done by these cuts would be impossible to reverse. ""We know that we are not doing enough, we are failing the basic needs of people. ""The situation is beyond irreparable. If you look at the number of children who will see their lives so dramatically impacted by malnutrition and lack of psychosocial support, you will see this is already happening.""  The majority of the UN's humanitarian work is funded entirely by voluntary donations from individual governments and private donors, with agencies such as the UNHCR and Unicef receiving none of the regular budget that member states pay into the UN's central coffers. Guterres is leading calls from within the UN to change this system and ask member states to make more regular payments to the main agencies.  The current global humanitarian funding budget for all countries stands at $19.52bn (£12.84bn), but only $7.15bn of that has been raised from international donors.  The Syria regional refugee response plan is only funded to 35% of the $1.3bn needed to support refugees, both in the camps and by providing resilience funding for the countries hosting them. In Africa, where the crises in the Central African Republic and South Sudan do not often make international headlines, many funding appeals are less than 15% full.  Experts say the current system, with constant emergency appeals to keep supply chains running month by month, must be changed to acknowledge that the situations in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Central African Republic are all deteriorating and need long-term funding.  In August, a multi-million dollar shortfall forced the World Health Organisation to close down 184 health clinics across 10 of Iraq's 18 districts, in an area that has seen severe fighting and massive internal displacement. The cuts have left three million people without access to healthcare. The World Health Organisation is trying to raise $60m to fund healthcare in Iraq but so far only $5.1m has been given by donors.  Dr Michelle Gayer is director for emergency risk management at the WHO. She told the Guardian that the gap between the desperate need in countries such as Iraq and current funding levels risked permanent damage to public health across whole populations.   ""The global community, including WHO, we are dealing with emergencies of really unprecedented scale and nature,"" she said. ""This has a disproportionate impact on health because health deteriorates in a conflict situation over time. ""People haven't been vaccinated, they suffer from malnutrition, they have mental health issues because of the conflict. We are setting countries back decades.""  Gayer said the decision to cut services was hugely difficult. ""We are never 100% funded so we are always having to prioritise, but it breaks your heart when you end services for 3 million people. There will be no access for trauma like shrapnel wounds, no access for children's health or reproductive health. There will be no surveillance of things like cholera. A generation of children will be unvaccinated.""  She supports the idea that there should be a change to the current funding system for UN agencies. ""Most people who work outside the humanitarian sector, they would fall over backwards if they knew how we do our work, having to ask each and every year for funding.""  Another major crisis for the UN is feeding refugees, not only those recently displaced but people who are still unable to return home years after leaving.  This year the World Food Programme cut rations to 1.6 million Syrian refugees. The most vulnerable living in Lebanon now only have $13 to spend on food each month, a figure that the WFP warned would leave refugees vulnerable to recruitment by extremist groups.  And this pattern has been repeated around the world. Since the beginning of the year, the WFP has twice cut food rations for refugees in the Daadab and Kakuma camps in northern Kenya, as well as for Sudanese refugees in Uganda. Dina El-Kassaby, a spokeswoman for the WFP based in Cairo, said the cut in rations was pushing refugees into making dangerous decisions, including returning to Syria or travelling irregularly to Europe.  ""This is a desperate situation for families. In the last few weeks in Jordan and Lebanon many refugees were asking me how they can get on one of these boats to Europe and we have run into many people who have said they will consider returning to Syria if food rations don't return to previous levels.""  ""As the year goes by and the funding crisis gets deeper we are making more and more cuts. Mothers are telling us that they are being evicted from their houses and are now living in makeshift shelters in the field because their rent money is going on food. Think about young men and boys who are responsible for feeding their families. Reaching these desperate levels makes them prime targets for Isis.""  One Syrian refugee, Fatmeh, said of her two children in Lebanon: ""When we can't afford both medicine and food, I tie scarves around my boys' bellies at night so they don't wake up crying from stomach aches because they are hungry."" Kassaby said the current funding system meant the WFP never had the funds it needed. ""This is a hand-to-mouth operation: the minute money comes in it goes out. We have been operating with a funding deficit since the beginning of the year and right now we are short of $149m to help Syrians just through September and October.""  The UNHCR also says it is seeing evidence that refugees are making the dangerous journey into Europe because conditions in the Middle East are worsening.  On the Greek islands, where UNHCR frontline workers meet refugees as they arrive by boat, they cite new arrivals saying they were pushed into leaving Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey by a shortage of food or a desperate need for medical treatment.  Carlotta Sami, the UNHCR spokeswoman for southern Europe, said: ""They mention ration cuts or difficulty in getting electricity. We meet many people who are chronically sick or have sick children and say they can't go on living in this way. One Syrian man had a bullet lodged in his stomach and had travelled from Turkey hoping he could have surgery in Germany. He was suffering so much.""  Guterres wants to see rapid changes to the funding system. ""It's a very dramatic situation and it's clear that because Syrians can't work legally and the assistance is not enough, then that is one of the reasons why more people are moving onwards.""  ""As [UN] peacekeeping operations are funded by assessed contributions I think that at least major emergencies like Syria should benefit from assessed contributions that all member states contribute to.  ""If you look at the humanitarian budget all over the world, it is somewhere between $20bn and $30bn. I don't know any bailout of even a medium-sized bank that did not cost more than that. Not to spend more on humanitarian aid is a bad strategy, not to say a suicidal one."" ",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,0,Conditions

Now Fatoma, who fled Sudan 10 years ago, will be with her as part of a groundbreaking scheme","Bouncing a chattering toddler on her knee, a patterned headscarf framing her broad smile, Safa shows few signs of how difficult her life has been. But as she describes the past five years, her hand moves instinctively to her pregnant stomach. In 2012, Safa and her husband, both in their late 20s, were living in Aleppo when a blast destroyed their home, injuring him and leaving them with nothing. The young couple travelled by bus to Lebanon where, for six months, they shared a room and one toilet with 10 other people. Surviving on a tiny stipend from the UN, they were eventually given their own room - ""about the size of this"", she says, gesturing to a small table - in return for collecting all the rubbish in the block. It was there that she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, now 18 months old. ""We were treated like animals,"" she says. It was in Lebanon that the new family learned they would become three of the 20,000 Syrian refugees the British government has agreed to take through the vulnerable persons relocation scheme. Of the news that they would be flown to Leeds, Safa recalls simply, ""It was wonderful, like a dream."" She became pregnant again soon after arriving in the UK, something that meant her life might still be at risk. Asylum-seeking and refugee women currently account for 14% of all maternal deaths in the UK (despite comprising only 0.5% of the population) according to the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries. Navigating the British health service without the language or confidence to ask the right questions, their interaction with maternity services can be too little or come too late, with complications going undetected. Asylum-seeking and refugee women are statistically more likely to experience late miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. In the UK, Safa faced the prospect of giving birth without anyone she knew in the room. ""My husband will be looking after her,"" she explains, whispering Arabic into her daughter's ear. ""And we are alone here - we had to leave all our friends and family in Aleppo."" I was scared. Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies Thanks to a newly revived befriender scheme run by the Refugee Council, Safa will not be alone. Last week, she was introduced to Fatoma, a bustling, maternal woman in a denim maxi dress and peach headscarf who scoops Safa's daughter up and tickles her. Fatoma fled the civil war in Sudan 10 years ago, arriving in Leeds; she has volunteered to support Safa through her pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood. She grins at her new friend: ""I met her for the first time on Tuesday, and she has already asked me to be at the hospital during her labour."" Fatoma understands what it is like to be alone in a country you do not understand, and which often does not understand you. When she gave birth to her daughter six years ago, it was ""terrifying, confusing and lonely"", she says, wiping away a tear. I meet Safa and Fatoma in a municipal office space in Leeds. They are among a small group of mothers (Sudanese, Syrian, Russian, Bolivian) who sit and trade stories, passing their babies between them. Each experienced a terrifying flight from her home country. Now, through the Refugee Council, each of them has volunteered to support another pregnant woman. ""These are some of the most marginalised women in our country,"" says Rose McCarthy, volunteer coordinator for the scheme, which started in 2011 and is currently relaunching with a focus on Syrian women. ""But they believe no one should have to give birth in this country afraid and alone."" With Fatoma translating her Arabic, Safa explains: ""I don't yet speak English, so when I have the baby I want someone with me I can trust and speak to in my own language."" She looks shyly at Fatoma. ""I feel so much better already, knowing that she will be there."" *** When Luisa arrived in this country from Bolivia in 2009, she spoke barely a word of English. Knowing no one, she spent two years determinedly learning the language by watching TV. When she became pregnant a few months later, it was a shock. ""She was my first baby, so I didn't know very much about being pregnant, or about labour,"" she says. ""I didn't even have a GP. And I didn't know about midwives - they don't exist where I come from."" When she gave birth, ""It was horrible - I felt like I was being torn apart."" At home in Chuquisaca, she was a law student. She was organising demonstrations against the government when, in 2008, there were violent clashes between supporters and opponents of President Evo Morales. Her friends began to disappear and her mother, fearing her daughter would be next, sent her to the UK. After her baby, also called Luisa, was born, the two were briefly sent to a detention centre, before being moved from London to Leeds. ""I became paranoid,"" Luisa says. ""I had an appointment at the Home Office, but no money to get there. I went to the Refugee Council offices to ask for emergency funds, but I'd already received some and they said no. I was desperate. I had no money to feed my daughter, so I left her there in the offices, making sure she was safe. Then I walked out and tried to kill myself."" She took an overdose of sleeping pills. Meanwhile, staff at the Refugee Council had found her telephone number, called her and kept her talking until an ambulance arrived. When she was discharged from hospital, Luisa was referred to the befriender scheme as a new mother in need. At the charity's offices, Luisa had her first meeting with her volunteer befriender, Dasha. ""I didn't want to know at first,"" Luisa admits. ""For a long time, I'd only really interacted with people who sat behind desks, asking lots of questions I didn't feel comfortable answering. I felt everyone was pitying me, and I can't stand pity. But Dasha was really funny, and really persistent. If I cancelled a plan to meet up, she might turn up on my doorstep. She worked in a cafe and would bring cake. For the first time since I arrived in this country, she talked to me as an equal, not an inferior."" Befrienders make the most enormous difference. They are figures of trust for women who may be scared to trust others Dasha, whose family claimed asylum in the UK from Russia 15 years ago, took Luisa to playgroups. Together, the women joined self-esteem classes provided by students from Leeds University in collaboration with the Refugee Council. ""She even bought me a Christmas present,"" Luisa says with a smile. One day, Dasha dropped by Luisa's flat and found her young daughter falling in and out of consciousness. ""Luisa didn't know what to do,"" Dasha remembers. ""There was deep snow outside but I told her we had to get to the hospital."" She bundled the three of them into a taxi and they rushed to A&E. ""The doctors were talking about terrifying possibilities, and making Luisa sign all sorts of forms,"" Dasha tells me. ""Everything turned out fine, but sometimes you just need a friend, someone who knows how the system works, someone who can explain and hold your hand, who can pack an overnight bag and bring snacks for you."" *** There are many reasons why migrant women might fail to engage with health services. Like Luisa, their isolation might mean they simply do not know about them. Others fear being charged for services they cannot afford: undocumented women can be charged up to £9,000 for giving birth in this country; last month's government proposal that patients could be required to bring two forms of identification to hospital to alleviate so-called ""health tourism"", has fuelled further fears. Pregnant refugees often need urgent care. They are likely to have arrived in this country malnourished, with conditions ranging from tuberculosis and malaria to HIV. Plus, as Dasha says, ""They come here to escape from danger - how could they not be psychologically damaged, too?"" Yet those who do access help often report poor experiences: no interpreters, or midwives and other maternity workers who do not understand their cultural and health needs. In Leeds, any English-speaking, asylum-seeking and refugee mothers can apply to be befrienders. Successful applicants undergo four training sessions, which cover listening and empowerment skills, as well as understanding how health and maternity care differs across cultures. In 2011, 74 women speaking 30 different languages were recruited as volunteers and matched with 180 women in Leeds, referred by midwives, children's centres and community refugee organisations. Research carried out after the first year showed that every woman involved reported a higher sense of wellbeing. Funding for the scheme ended in 2014 - but three months ago, McCarthy managed to revive the programme, specifically to support the 419 Syrians who have been resettled in the Yorkshire and Humberside region since October 2015. Her old volunteers have flooded back, along with new ones. Since September, McCarthy has recruited and trained 40 volunteers. The first three befriending pairs have already been matched. With 1,340 Syrians expected to settle in the region over the next two to three years, ""there is a big appetite for it"", she says. *** When Alia arrived in the UK this year, she had to hide the fact that she was more than eight months pregnant: she feared being banned from the flight. She was fleeing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan (where an estimated 480,000 people have now been killed ), to meet her husband, who had already made the arduous journey and settled in Leeds. ""I took her to the local children's centres, and to antenatal classes,"" says Muna, a volunteer befriender, and another Darfur refugee, who met Alia within days of her arrival. Then one evening her phone rang. ""Her husband was crying,"" Muna remembers. ""He said: 'We're at the hospital and they say there is an infection. The baby is in danger. We need an emergency caesarean but Alia won't consent.'"" While Muna tells their story, Alia quietly nurses her five-month-old son, Sammy. ""I was scared,"" she says softly, with Muna as her translator. ""Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies."" ""So I ran,"" says Muna. ""I dropped everything and ran all the way to the hospital. I didn't see the cars. Everything was a blur.""

The crowd coming in from the Serbian border town of Horgos remained in front of the gate facing the police cordon. A Hungarian water cannon was parked facing them. Earlier, an Hungarian court has found an Iraqi man guilty of ""illegally crossing the border,"" the first conviction based on a new law meant to stop the huge flow of migrants into Hungary. Hungarian media reported the judge ordered the man expelled from Hungary and banned him from returning for one year. It was expected that he would be returned to Serbia, the country that many migrants have used on their way into Hungary. The accused said he was unaware that illegal border crossing was a crime, but the judge rejected his argument, saying ""ignorance of the law doesn't excuse anybody."" The judge said the 4-meter (13-foot) border fence surrounded by razor wire should have given him a clue. The defendant also must pay 19,050 Hungarian forints ($70) in court costs. __ block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.00pm BST block-time published-time 2.21pm BST  Muslim refugees are being repeatedly offered pork by the Hungarian authorities, according to the aid agency Muntada Aid. Kabir Miah, overseas manager at the charity, emailed this testimony, after visiting the treatment of refugees at Hungary's border with Serbia. What we witnessed at Roszke shocked us. We saw women, children, babies and elderly people being herded into an open field where they were kept for days without shelter exposed to the cold and rain. On Monday night it was raining and the refugees burned anything they could find including wet blanket to keep themselves warm. Children were suffering asthma attacks from inhaling the smoke. Diabetics were having fits as no insulin was available. One person was coughing blood. There were no doctors. When we arrived three volunteers told us that an Afghan refugee came to them asking them to look at a sandwich he was given by the Hungarian police. He wanted to know if was not pork. They confirmed it tasted like pork. The sandwiches were returned to the police, who were informed that the refugees were Muslim and therefore prohibited from eating pork. The next morning police again brought eight baskets of sandwiches, all containing pork salami. Again they were returned, and the police were asked not to bring pork. By the evening more sandwiches arrived also containing pork. When one of the volunteers complained a police officer said the refugees should just remove the pork and eat the bread. He said it felt as though the police were mocking them. This is shocking and offensive to Muslims. The authorities are aware the refugees were Muslim. But don't seem to care. block-time published-time 1.58pm BST   Refugees stand on a platform at the central railway station in Freilassing, Germany.

Up to 50% of refugees arriving in Germany are suffering either from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, or both, the BPtK said in a statement released on its website. The statement said: ""40% have already had suicidal thoughts or have even attempted to kill themselves."" One in five refugee children also suffers from PTSD. The chamber's president Dietrich Munz called on the government to bring in rules to regulate psychological treatment in refugee shelters, where it said only four percent are currently receiving help. ""The arriving refugees not only need shelter and food, but medical treatment,"" he said. ""In fact, the care for psychologically ill refugees in Germany remains shamefully poor."" block-time published-time 1.53pm BST   Summary  Here's a roundup of the latest key developments: Almost 300 migrants have entered Croatia after Hungary imposed a border crackdown. Croatia's prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, pledged to help the migrants reach western Europe and said Hungary's razor wire fence sent a ""terrible message."" Mine clearers have been dispatched to the Croatia frontier amid concerns that refugees may inadvertently stray into Balkan minefields in their search for ways round new border restriction. They were called in by police concerned at the threat posed by minefields left over from Croatia's 1991-95 war. Britain is sending a warship to the Mediterranean to stop people being smuggled into Europe. Germany has agreed to send more troops to the area as part of a new phase of an European operation against smugglers. The Austrian rail operator OEBB suspended services between Salzburg and Germany on the orders of the German authorities. Earlier the Austrian authorities began selective controls of vehicles at three main border motorway crossings with Hungary. Home Secretary Theresa May repeated the UK government's opposition to an-EU wide system of quotas for resettling refugees. ""Claiming asylum must not be viewed as an easy means of resettlement in Europe,"" she told the Commons. Hungary reported a huge drop in migrants after the imposition of its migration crackdown. The Hungarian police claimed the number of new arrivals fell from a record 9,380 on Monday to just 366 on Tuesday. block-time published-time 1.28pm BST  The Guardian's migration correspondent, Patrick Kingsley, has more on the migrants crossing into Croatia.

Ben Knight in Berlin reports: The German cabinet has decided to deploy up to 950 German soldiers against human traffickers on the Mediterranean, with authority to stop, confiscate, and if necessary destroy traffickers' boats, German news agency DPA has reported. The German parliament still has to approve the mission. The move would represent a significant expansion of Germany's military commitment in the Mediterranean. Berlin is currently contributing some 320 troops to the ongoing Eunavfor Med operation, which has been policing the waters between Italy and Libya since May. But so far its orders are only to rescue migrants in distress. block-time published-time 12.58pm BST   Theresa May Photograph: PA/PA  Home secretary Theresa May has repeated the UK government's opposition to an-EU wide system of quotas for resettling refugees. Briefing Parliament on Monday's meeting of EU interior ministers she said: ""We do not support all of the commission's recent proposals which include the relocation of 120,000 people already in Europe."" She claimed the proposed system would encourage people to risk their lives making dangerous journeys to Europe. ""Instead we should, as the UK is doing, be resettling people direct from the region,"" May said. But May did express ""strong support"" for the idea of screening centres in ""hotspots"" such as Greece and Italy where asylum seekers can have their claims processed. She said: ""These centres will identify those in need of international protection and give them quick access to asylum procedures. They must become operational immediately."" Under the system those not in need of protection will be sent back to their country of origin, May said. ""Claiming asylum must not be viewed as an easy means of resettlement in Europe,"" she said. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.01pm BST block-time published-time 12.11pm BST  The French parliament is due to debate the refugee crisis this afternoon, writes Angelique Chrisafis in Paris. With French public opinion split, and polls showing around half of French people oppose taking more refugees, the debate is likely to be heated. The Socialist party has been attacked by many on the left for not doing enough. The right has called for a tightening on immigration rules. Marine Le Pen's far-right Front National has used the crisis to hammer home its anti-immigration stance in the run-up to regional elections. Meanwhile, AFP has filed a law-suit against Robert Ménard, the controversial far-right mayor of the southern French town of Béziers for misuse of one of its photographs. The original photograph of people on a train platform was taken in June in Macedonia. But in the Béziers town journal, edited by Ménard's office, it was used under the headline: ""The asylum-seekers are coming to Béziers!"" and was altered to include two slogans on the train windows: ""Beziers, 3,865 km"", and ""Free schooling, lodging and allowances for all."" frltrBéziers : l'AFP et son photographe demandent 30 000 euros chacun à Robert Ménard http://t.co/hbjjAvrLKnpic.twitter.com/eBgW8ePoRH  - Libération (@libe) September 16, 2015 block-time published-time 11.57am BST  The BBC's Bethany Bell photographs refugees in Vienna plotting their journey across Europe. deltrVienna Westbahnhof station #refugeescrisis#migrantcrisispic.twitter.com/GFw8bHqPlZ  - Bethany Bell (@BethanyBellBB) September 16, 2015 block-time published-time 11.53am BST   277 migrants enter Croatia  The number of people arriving in Croatia is rising sharply, according to the latest government update reported by Reuters.

The decision was made in a four-hour crisis meeting between Angela Merkel and the state premiers on Tuesday evening, during which the state premiers of the individual German states called on the chancellor to provide more help. Until now, individual states have had to take on the administration of the massive in-take of refugees arriving in the country. That has put huge pressure on Bavaria, and especially Munich, where the bulk of refugees first arrive. In the past two weeks, local Bavarian authorities have had to call around other states looking for places where the new arrivals could stay. After Tuesday's meeting, Merkel said that the states had agreed that central distribution centres would be set up all around the country, though it remains unclear exactly where they would be. A special domestic summit between all the regional governments has been called in Berlin next week, where the states are likely to call on Merkel to increase the local government budgets for dealing with refugees. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.45am BST block-time published-time 10.40am BST   Croatia to allow free passage Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images  Croatia's prime minister has promised migrants free passage through his country.

Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPA  German police have said dozens of refugees pulled the emergency brakes on a special train from Munich to Berlin on Tuesday and jumped off in the countryside in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, writes Ben Knight in Berlin. Of some 518 refugees that were expected to arrive in the train in the German capital, only 339 arrived, federal police spokesman Jens Schobranski confirmed. They have since been rounded up and registered in centres in the state where they got off, he said. The emergency brakes were pulled several times during the journey and whole groups of refugees jumped off at different points, police said. According to Berlin state's social affairs ministry, which is in charge of administering the influx of refugees in the German capital, there could be many reasons why the 179 refugees stopped the train. They either had friends or relatives in the area, or were attempting to avoid being officially registered in Germany so that they could find their way to Sweden instead. On its Facebook page, the ministry said there had been no police on board the train - only the security personnel of Germany's rail operator Deutsche Bahn. The ministry said on Tuesday that the train in question had been diverted earlier in the day. In a statement posted on Facebook, the ministry said, ""The train was originally supposed to head to another federal state, which said that it could no longer take in refugees. The states of Berlin and Brandenburg then spontaneously decided to take the people in. For that reason the train was diverted en route."" It remains unclear whether the diversion was connected with the deployment of the emergency brakes.

More than 500 people have been killed by landmines in the last 20 years in Croatia, which plans to clear all its suspected minefields only by 2019.

Tuesday's events in ""Fortress Europe"" were neatly summed up by the Guardian's migration correspondent Patrick Kingsley.  First Hungary blocked its southern border with Serbia, putting into action its much-heralded fence, declaring a state of emergency in two southern counties, and arresting dozens of people for attempting to cross the border under new laws unveiled last week by the prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Next Hungary announced plans to seal its border with Romania, a move denounced as ""not a fair gesture"" ",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,NA,Events

The Europe of values, reflected in the obligation for countries applying for EU membership not just to meet economic tests but to have democratic institutions and a proven respect for human rights, is under strain. Economic recession, the threat of terrorism and the rise of the extreme right are all weakening its institutional underpinnings: high ideals are always at risk from low politics. But this is no abstract question. It is an all-too-real disaster for hundreds of thousands of Syrians and others who are fleeing war and persecution and have endured perilous journeys to reach the southern fringes of Europe. It could also be dangerous for the EU itself. Germany, partly for reasons to do with its history and its growing demand for labour, is emerging as the champion of the moral case. On Sunday, in a significant demonstration of its commitment to Europe's fundamental values, the government unilaterally suspended the Dublin protocol, which obliges refugees to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach, for all Syrians. On the same day, the foreign and economic ministers co-wrote a 10-point plan for a Europe-wide migration, refugee and asylum policy founded on the principle of solidarity and ""our shared values of humanity"". On Monday, Angela Merkel and François Hollande reiterated support for a Europe-wide solution - adapting Germany's own internal system of distributing refugees fairly throughout the country - that was comprehensively rejected in June. Meanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, made his own call to arms, condemning in the name of Europe's shared values those he accused of trying to cordon themselves off from ""distress, fear and misery"", and the populist politicians who stirred up xenophobia in the name of winning votes. Germany has taken more than 40% of the Syrian refugees who have reached Europe (and those, it should be recognised, are only a tiny proportion, less than 5%, of the total number of Syrians who have fled the civil war). Sweden has taken another 20%; the southern European countries of Greece, Italy and Spain account for another 25%. The proportion offered asylum in Britain is fewer than 1%. But as the June summit proved, there is strong resistance from across eastern Europe as well as from the UK to allowing Brussels to set a course for collective action. This political argument is hindering a fair and principled solution. This is, at the very least, shortsighted. As Angela Merkel argues, the refugee crisis is one of the greatest challenges the EU has faced, and it is not likely to ease off for years to come. As a matter of solidarity, it is unacceptable that the poorer countries of southern Europe should be left to pick up a disproportionate share of the bill for playing host to a fast-growing number of refugees and migrants, while richer countries turn their backs. Without a responsibility-sharing scheme, the far right, who were behind the attacks on refugees and migrants that marred some German towns last weekend, will only grow stronger. If only as a matter of self-interest, Britain should seize the chance to educate young Syrians and turn them into English-speaking citizens who in a sunnier future will play a role in rebuilding their native country and forging links between their old home and their new one.  Related: Settling on credible solutions to the European Union's refugee crisis | Letters Instead, the approach from the Conservative government has been unremittingly hostile. Last week's meeting between British and French home affairs ministers to try to resolve the Calais crisis resulted only in an ever more punitive regime of razor wire and crackdowns. Meanwhile, on Thursday the ONS will publish the latest snapshot of net migration to the UK. These are likely to confirm that the level is now at an all-time high, above even the 320,000 recorded in 2005 - despite all the rhetoric and legislative effort of the past five years to bring it below 100,000. That is why new clauses to the immigration bill, further tightening sanctions on employers who employ illegal migrants and introducing a prison sentence of up to six months for anyone working illegally, have been announced. Fence-building in Hungary, razor wire in Calais, prison in the UK: none of these are real solutions to either the economic or political challenges of this era of mass migration. Nor are they any sort of adequate response to the moral imperative of offering shelter to those seeking asylum.",Broadsheet,0,2015-08,1,Migration

In some of her strongest criticism of the government's handling of the Syrian crisis, the former shadow home secretary will say Britain's response is ""still far too weak"", as she calls on ministers to redouble their efforts to help refugees as winter approaches. Cooper, who agreed to serve as chair of Labour's refugee taskforce after she came third in the party's leadership contest, will tell an event organised by the national community organising charity Citizens UK on Tuesday: ""As governments across Europe struggle to cope and the weather gets colder, it is no longer an option for the prime minister to turn his back and pretend this isn't our problem. ""We have to act. We cannot stand on the sidelines while children freeze to death on our doorstep. This is now the biggest humanitarian crisis to reach Europe since the second world war, and every European nation needs to do its bit to help."" Cooper will step up the pressure on the government to act after a panel of retired law lords described the government's plan to take in 20,000 Syrian refugees over the course of this parliament as ""too low, too slow and too narrow"". The group, including the former president of the supreme court, Lord Phillips, said Britain should allow ""safe and legal routes"" to the UK to admit a ""fair and proportionate share of refugees"".  Cooper will say that Britain should take 10,000 people over the next year - a figure that can be reached if every county and city took 10 families. This was the target she set in a speech during the closing weeks of the Labour leadership contest. Responding to the discovery of 71 decomposing bodies inside a parked lorry in Austria in August, Cooper accused the government last month of cowardly and immoral behaviour for refusing to admit more refugees. Cooper will say on Tuesday: ""We need immediate action to help not just those in the Syrian camps, but some of those who have made it to Europe too. If every county and city took 10 families we could help 10,000 people over the next year alone."" Her previous speech, which was delivered a few days before t he body of the three-year-old Syrian refugee Alan Kurdi was discovered on a Turkish beach, captured a mood that Britain was failing to rise to the crisis. The government eventually said it would admit 20,000 refugees by 2020. On Tuesday, Cooper will again make clear she believes the government's response has been inadequate. She will say: ""The refugee crisis is getting worse not better, but the British government's response is still far too weak. Winter is looming and far more needs to be done to help thousands of vulnerable families who have no home to go to and who fall prey to smuggling gangs. ""Across the country people are joining the call for Britain to do more. Faith groups, community organisations, charities, councils, landlords, lawyers, businesses, universities are all calling for more action. Citizens UK and other organisations have shown the powerful demand for action from people in every corner of our country. ""Yet so far the British government has taken very few Syrian refugees and won't tell us how many have arrived. They need to tell us immediately how many have come, and how many are due each month. Currently the government is way off track to meet the prime minister's pledge of helping 4,000 a year, and is still doing far less than other European countries to help.""",Broadsheet,0,2015-10,1,Policy

1610,src_theguardian_raw3.docx,The Guardian,24/12/2014,593 words,Anne Perkins,Calais' desperate migrants are dying - politicians must intervene urgently; The EU and those countries at the front-line of migration can ease the squalor and poverty that migrants are having to endure," Crac des Chevaliers is a medieval castle that still sits on a 650-metre high peak just over Lebanon's northern border with Syria. It was once one of a chain of crusader castles, a relic of 200 years of conflict so massive that it survived into the 21st century in a remarkable state of completeness. Only four years ago, it was easy for a traveller to stand on the battlements and imagine how those who held it exercised control over hundreds of miles of the surrounding fertile land. After three years of civil war, the state of the castle is uncertain. There are images of it under artillery fire. Maybe this historic icon has also been reduced to being collateral damage, like the millions of Syrian refugees who are now enduring another freezing winter in the camps of Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. Crac des Chevaliers used to be a highlight of any trip around the historic glories of the eastern and southern Mediterranean. Syria, Egypt, Libya - all ancient places rich in history and culture. They have also been, for most of the past 50 years, police states. Entry and exit were strictly controlled. They were not easily crossed. Few refugees fleeing the chaos of Eritrea or Somalia would imagine travelling overland. Now that these police states have imploded, it's as if Europe's outer defences, its barbican, had, like Crac des Chevaliers itself, crumbled. As a result, the victims of the war and lawlessness of the Middle East head to Europe to escape, as do refugees from Eritrea and Somalia. Some of them work their way overland to Calais, hoping to get to Britain. According to the UN, there are now 3,000 refugees camped in squalor and poverty in and around the port. That is three times as many as a year ago. And there they are stuck, unable to move on, reluctant to move back, ready literally to risk their lives. This year, 15 are known to have died, jumping from bridges onto lorries, hit by lorries manoeuvring in parking areas, trapped by lorry fires. The figure does not include the young man who was killed last week on the M25, crushed as he tried to get out from under the lorry he had hidden on, or the Eritrean, knocked over by a bus in Norfolk, or the Afghan man who suffocated in a locked container. There is not an easy answer to this humanitarian crisis. But there is an answer. As the former head of the British Refugee Council, Tim Finch, argues in his most recent blog, two big changes need to be made. First, proper camps should be established near countries that contribute most to the outflow of people; there, those seeking asylum can be assessed. That would be the start of a fair system of resettlement. It would also ease the sense of a disorderly mass at the gates of Europe that obscures rational debate. Second, the EU must acknowledge its obligation to play a central part in a planned resettlement project. The countries neighbouring Syria, none of which are as rich as most European countries, are currently sheltering 3 million refugees. The EU, with 500 million citizens, has taken 1 million. Germany and Sweden, both of which take in thousands, are at the top of any list. Britain has offered a home to a few hundred. This won't happen while politicians conflate the two distinct issues of migration and refugees, and frame every debate in terms of harm. That makes it impossible to search for consensus around a constructive and compassionate solution. Yet until such a conversation begins, there will continue to be, just across the English Channel, a shameful blot on our moral landscape.",Broadsheet,0,2014-12,0,Conditions

This week, preparing once again for the 400-mile drive north, I read a daunting opinion of our destination. In a Daily Mail report that has provoked a small storm on social media, a 35-year-old Syrian refugee, speaking under the pseudonym Rasha, said that Bute was ""full of old people"", a place where ""people come to die"". Her 42-year-old husband Abd (also a false name) worried that this would also happen to him; first despair, then entropy and the slow decline towards the grave. Abd said Scotland was beautiful, the people there had treated him well, he even liked the weather, but: ""There is no movement, there is nothing. I'm not bored any more. I am depressed now. I feel like I have one option now - to die here. Only die here, nothing else.""  Related: 'People want to help': Scottish town prepares to host Syrian refugees Rasha, Abd and their four children came to Bute in December from a refugee camp in Lebanon, together with 11 other Syrian families - 28 adults and 31 children in total - who were given homes in the island's only town, Rothesay, under the UK government's Syrian vulnerable person resettlement programme. Local authorities administer the programme from funds allotted to them by the Home Office; in Scotland, Argyll and Bute was one of the first authorities to sign up. Pictures of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old boy found drowned on a beach in Turkey were still fresh in the public memory; the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, offered to take refugees into her own home ; public sympathy had still to be corrupted, confused or diluted by the events at the Bataclan theatre and subsequent terrorist outrages. ""People in Argyll and Bute are known for their warmth and friendliness, as has been proved by the huge offers of support ... for those seeking refuge from Syria,"" said Len Scoullar, a Bute councillor and the council's provost. The council and other agencies provided interpreters, English language tutors and other kinds of assistance and advice to families who, as Scoullar said, ""must be feeling incredibly vulnerable and confused"". Other host communities did the same thing, but nowhere else attracted as much publicity. The phrase ""Scottish island"" evokes Mendelssohn, Whisky Galore and the adventures of Katie Morag - romantic places, remote from mainland degradation, where the doors of the little white houses are never locked at night. Only when the television viewer saw the first refugees wheeling their suitcases through what looked like a damp council estate, under a sombre December sky, did a different reality intrude. The statistics relating to Bute aren't encouraging. According to the Scottish government's index of multiple deprivation, certain streets in Rothesay are among the most deprived in Scotland, notable for their low household incomes and high crime levels. Research by the Campaign to End Child Poverty has suggested that more than a quarter of the island's children live in poverty, the highest proportion of any district in the local authority. No need to ask why the Syrian families were resettled on the island: it has houses waiting to be filled More alarmingly, in terms of Bute's future, is a rate of population decline that is probably the steepest of any sizeable Scottish island: in the 60 years between the censuses of 1951 and 2011, its population halved - from 12,547 to 6,498 - and has almost certainly shrunk by hundreds more in the seven years since. In Argyll and Bute as a whole, the population over the next 20 years is projected to decline by 13.5% from its 2012 estimate of 87,000. There will be many more of the old, already present in disproportionate numbers, and even fewer of the young - a trend that runs counter to the forecast for Scotland as whole, which has a projected population increase of 8.8% over the same period. No need to ask why the Syrian families were resettled on the island: it has houses waiting to be filled. Despite the statistics, there are far worse places to land in. Rothesay is one of the most beautifully situated towns in Britain, a long line of Victorian and Edwardian tenements and marine villas that curves around a sheltered bay and faces towards the Cowal hills. Its glory days as Scotland's most popular seaside resort have long gone, but there are some lovely residues. The prom has palms, prize-winning flowerbeds and putting greens. A grand Victorian hotel looks down a long flight of steps to the sea. The modernist pavilion, which is to Rothesay what the De La Warr building is to Bexhill, is now being expensively restored as a venue for all kinds of entertainment and art, local and imported. Glasgow is less than two hours away by ferry and train and Greenock even closer: nonetheless, some fine local shops persist. It was in one these, the greengrocer Jessmay's, that earlier this year I overheard a Syrian couple say the word oregano. Jessmay didn't in fact stock oregano, for which there is little demand on Bute, but after a previous visit from the Syrian couple she had brought some from her garden, where it grows wild, and given it to them. A day or two later I met the same couple on the Glasgow train. ""Oregano,"" I said. ""Oregano!"" said the husband. He spoke very little English and I understand no Arabic - ""oregano"" was our limited lingua franca - but somehow he asked where I was going and somehow I made him understand, London. ""Ah, London,"" he said, as if he too might like to be going there. In the light of normal migratory ambition - to live where your compatriots have already settled - the thrust of the Mail's story is hardly surprising. The paper interviewed two couples linked by sisters - Rasha and Fatima married Abd and Hassan (all pseudonyms but scarcely protective, given the group photographs of the two families that accompanied the piece). The husbands were businessmen in Homs before their homes and livelihoods were destroyed, and both want, in the words of Abd via an interpreter, ""to go to a place where there are more Arabic people, [where] I can ... learn English here and there and probably catch a job"". He hadn't expected to come to Bute. ""We thought we were going to London or Manchester. But whenever we say anything about moving off the island, we are told 'We had to pay a lot of money to bring you here'."" The story was an online hit for both the Mail and the Telegraph, which ran its version a day later, and it might be reasonably assumed that the reason for its popularity was the desire among a section of the public to see refugees as ingrates; in the words of the blogger Lisa O'Donnell, it was ""a manipulative piece of journalism allowing the Daily Mail to perpetuate its true political agenda, which is not supportive of asylum"". The story's origins, however, were more complicated. Five weeks earlier, a Mail reporter had come to Bute to pursue another story involving a refugee. The story proved untrue, but the reporter made contacts in the Syrian community who later got in touch with the paper to publicise their concerns about their lack of prospects on the island. The first version of the piece, published in the Mail of Sunday, was longer, gentler and gave more weight to their gratitude. Through cutting and sharpening, the daily paper made the complaints more provocative. In the days since the story appeared, other refugees have come forward to say how happy they are on the island - how well they have been treated, how nice the people are. A balance has been restored. Still, to stare out from the promenade on a dark August afternoon, when the clouds almost touch the sea and rain drips down your face from your anorak hood ... to be driven into a frenzy of itching by midges the same evening ... to regret the lunchtime mutton pie with the chicken korma on top: in these circumstances, who would think ill of a person for wanting away to sunshine, tabbouleh, common memories and convivial friends?",Broadsheet,0,2016-07,0,Conditions

Announcing the global humanitarian appeal on Monday, Valerie Amos, UN under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said 2015 was going to be an incredibly difficult year for 57.5 million of the world's most vulnerable people. ""Over 80% of those we intend to help are in countries mired in conflict where brutality and violence have had a devastating impact on their lives,"" she said. ""We will continue to put people at the centre of our relief efforts and do everything we can to respond quickly and effectively, but the rising scale of need is outpacing our capacity to respond.""  This year has seen a sharp rise in the number of people affected by conflict, with millions forced to flee their homes and left dependent on humanitarian aid. Although the appeal also covers Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma, the occupied Palestinian territories, Somalia, Sudan, Ukraine and Yemen, more than 70% of the amount requested is needed for relief efforts in CAR, Iraq, South Sudan and Syria. A significant portion of the requested funds would go to trying to alleviate the Syrian crisis, with $2.8bn intended to help 12.2 million inside the country and a further $4.4bn needed to help 6 million Syrian refugees in five asylum countries. The UN estimates that the war in Syria has killed 191,000 people, displaced 7.6 million internally and compelled another 3.2 million to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.  Last week, the World Food Programme suspended the distribution of food vouchers to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees after it failed to secure the necessary funding from the international community. It warned that the impact could be devastating for a displaced population facing a harsh winter. Conflict and insecurity in Iraq have displaced more than 2.1 million people across the country and left 5.2 million in need of aid - of whom 2.2 million are in areas under the control of Isis. In South Sudan, where civil war broke out a year ago, 1.5 million people are severely food insecure, while the sectarian violence that has plagued CAR since March has left a quarter of the population - more than 1 million people - displaced within its borders or in neighbouring countries. ""This is not business as usual in the humanitarian world,"" said António Guterres, the UN high commissioner for refugees. ""Today's needs are at unprecedented levels, and without more support there simply is no way to respond to the humanitarian situations we're seeing in region after region and in conflict after conflict.""  The numbers of those in need is likely to rise in February, when the UN launches strategic response plans for Djibouti and nine countries in the Sahel region. Last December, the UN appealed for the then-unprecedented sum of $12.9bn for 2014 as it tried to deal with Syria, CAR and the aftermath of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The demand for this year has now risen to $17.9bn, of which international donors have provided $9.4bn. ""Every year we ask our donors to do more - and they do. But as crises become more complex and go on longer, the gap between needs and resources grows,"" said Amos.  ""I hope we can close it in 2015 because if we don't raise the money it means that we are able to help fewer children, women and men with medicine, food and shelter; the basics they need to survive.""

Take a closer look; The first refugees have been returned under the EU-Turkey deal, and there are already concerns about coercion and force being used","Today had been declared the first day that migrants and refugees would be deported from Greece within the framework of the EU-Turkey deal, and European authorities seemed determined not to miss the date. So as of Sunday, Greek police, along with the EU border agency Frontex, organised a large-scale operation to ensure the smooth handling of today's returns from the islands of Chios and Lesbos. The operation was initially deemed a success, with reports being limited to the boats and their occupants, which offered some digestible photo ops. There is plenty of evidence, though, that suggests that it has been no more than a media-savvy gesture on behalf of the European commission. How much coercion and force will become necessary when people really start resisting deportations? Officials from Frontex clarified that the boats carried mostly Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Afghans and Moroccans who were going to be deported to Turkey prior to the deal or didn't request asylum. There were only two Syrians among them who appear not to have requested international protection. Indeed authorities appear to have rushed to identify such people so they could be available for today's return. Termed ""easy cases"" by Frontex spokeswoman Eva Moncure, they are perfect material for today's photo op. As it turns out, more than 90% of people arriving in Greek islands since 20 March - when the EU-Turkey deal was enacted - have opted for asylum, thus complicating their return under the arrangement. It is no surprise then that no further dates have been announced for future deportations.  Related: EU-Turkey deal begins as Syrian refugees arrive in Germany The first day of deportations has been met with affirmative statements by credible international organisations, including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who confirmed that all procedures were regular and rights of deportees were observed. Everything is smooth and tidy, it seems. But this is one version of the story only. There is a second where things have gone less smoothly. Activist lawyers' accounts and journalist reports from the islands raise the question of whether refugees have been given sufficient time and access to asylum procedures. It appears that many of them do not yet understand the content of the deal or why they have been restricted, and there has been a last-minute rush for asylum claims among the people who are possible deportees. It is also unclear how Turkey plans to handle returnees, how they will be received, and whether they will be able to receive the protection that was previously offered to them there.  Related: Turkey is no 'safe haven' for refugees - it shoots them at the border | Patrick Kingsley In one case yesterday at a pre-removal centre in Chios, police faced angry protesters among those rounded up to be deported. Videos have emerged in which detainees appear to scream ""no deport"" and ""shame on Europe"". It is unclear to what degree the deportees have been coerced to comply with operational procedures. Such evidence is important in order to pose questions about the future of the deal. How much coercion and force will become necessary when people really start resisting deportations? How will the EU follow up the nasty details of the process when Frontex does not have a complaints mechanism to carry out inquiries into violations? What will be the limits for NGOs and international organisations before they become complicit? Deportation from Europe has a dark history, hence the need for a positive photo op today.

The prime minister, who arrives in New York for a UN summit aimed at curbing global poverty, backs the view of his foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, that Assad must ultimately step down but could remain for a while as part of a transitional government. Hammond told the Commons foreign affairs committee several weeks ago that Assad could be allowed to stay for up to six months, but a government source said Downing Street does not have a specific timeframe in mind, raising the possibility it could be longer. A British government source said: ""The prime minister's view is that there is not a long-term, stable, peaceful future for Syria where Syrian people can return home with President Assad as its leader, and that's what we've got to work towards ... We would be open to working with other countries on a solution whereby there is a transition. We haven't got a specific timeframe for when we think Assad should go. We've always been clear that there would need to be some sort of transition."" Russia's continued backing for Assad, including the dispatch of troops and aircraft to Syria last week, appears to be forcing the west to reconsider its position on the four-year civil war, in which the dictator is battling Islamic State and a wide variety of other insurgent groups. The UN general assembly in New York offers an opportunity for world leaders to inject new momentum into international talks on Syria, especially as attendees include US president Barack Obama and Russian president Vladimir Putin. The prime minister has issued a robust defence of his approach to the Syrian refugee crisis and other humanitarian challenges across the world ahead of the summit. In an exclusive article for the Observer, he argues that the UK's multibillion-pound overseas aid programme has provided ""life-saving support"" to millions of people displaced by the conflict in Syria. Cameron says the UK aid payments, now totalling around £12bn a year, allow this country to meet its moral obligations and respond fast to global challenges as they arise. Writing on the eve of the Labour party conference, where he will face criticism for reacting too slowly to the refugee crisis, Cameron insists his commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP every year on overseas aid puts the UK on the high ground and allows it to take the lead in humanitarian responses. Throughout Cameron's premiership his commitment to the 0.7% policy - which was finally enshrined in law in March this year - has attracted strong criticism from rightwing Tory MPs, who have argued that much of the money is wasted and would be better spent in the UK at a time of austerity. Cameron has also been attacked recently from the left - and by church leaders - for a slow and insensitive initial response to the refugee crisis. Taking on his critics from both sides, the prime minister argues that the huge sums committed to aid allow the UK to respond flexibly and speedily to crises, while also directing money to economic development andthe spread of democracy. ""We have helped to set the agenda,"" Cameron writes. ""We fought hard to keep tackling extreme poverty as the clarion call for the world. We were determined that issues like gender equality and tackling climate change would be an integral part of the goals. ""And we made sure there was a proper focus on the causes of poverty - like corruption - as well as its symptoms. For the first time ever, we have got proper references to good government, the rule of law and access to justice. Above all, because we kept our promises on aid spending, others listen to us. ""We need aid to provide life-saving support for refugees in Syria and neighbouring countries so they don't embark on perilous journeys to Europe. We need aid to tackle epidemics like Ebola in west Africa, saving hundreds of thousands of lives and preventing it spreading around the world. We need aid to shore up stability in countries like Somalia, helping to protect the people there and preventing these places becoming safe havens for terrorists."" Between 2010, Cameron's first year as prime minister, and 2013, overseas aid rose by £3.01bn to £11.46bn. In April last year, the UK reached its goal of spending of 0.7% of GDP on aid, becoming the first G8 country to do so. His comments in the Observer will be seen as an attempt to reach out to centre-ground voters with a message about compassionate Conservatism. In his first speech as Liberal Democrat leader,Tim Farron tore into Cameron last week for his response to the refugee crisis, saying he had put in the ""minimum effort for the maximum headlines"". Farron said Cameron's plans to take in 20,000 people fleeing the Syrian civil war by 2020 would not help a single refugee already in Europe and criticised him for not taking part in the EU quota system.",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,NA,Events

The UN refugee agency ""warmly welcomed"" Australia's humanitarian assistance, which includes a pledge of $44m to help shelter and clothe people as winter approaches, but the agency reiterated the sheer scale of the ""tragedy of our time"" as millions of desperate people flee violence and many children miss years of schooling.  Related: Is it legal for Australia to bomb Syria? Five facts you need to know The prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced on Wednesday that the one-off allocation of 12,000 places would be on top of Australia's existing annual humanitarian intake of 13,750 - bowing to pressure from ministers, backbenchers, state premiers, other political parties and community members to increase the overall quota to help the plight of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Abbott said he ""didn't want to rush into something before receiving advice"" and it was ""important that we act with our head as well as with our heart here"". The prime minister also confirmed on Wednesday that Australian strike aircraft - which have been involved in coalition bombing raids in Iraq since 2014 - would expand their missions into Syria within a week on the basis of ""collective self-defence"" of Iraq. Using an alternative name for Isis, Abbott emphasised that Australian operations would be ""targeting Daesh, not the Assad regime, evil though it is"". ""What we want throughout the Middle East are governments that do not commit genocide against their own people, nor permit terrorism against ours,"" he said. Labor pledged its support for the increased refugee intake and for the expanded airstrikes, although it urged the government to convene a parliamentary debate and explain ""their long-term strategy regarding Australia's changing role in the defence of Iraq"".  Related: First of the extra 12,000 refugees could arrive in Australia before Christmas The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, told parliament: ""There are legitimate demands to understand the exit strategy. And to ask, what does success look like? To ask, what kind of peace we are seeking to build?"" Minor parties and independents were more forthright in warning about the lack of a clear strategy. The leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, said the government had failed to learn from the previous Iraq war and risked making a bad problem worse. ""There is no legal basis for airstrikes in Syria and there is no clear strategy,"" he said. The independent MP Andrew Wilkie said Australia was recklessly allowing itself ""to be drawn deeper and deeper into the broader Middle East civil war"". But the government received plaudits from across the political spectrum for the extra intake of refugees. The first of the extra 12,000 Syrian refugees should arrive in Australia before Christmas as officials crank up a $700m process to select, check and resettle them. Amin Awad, the UNHCR's bureau director for the Middle East and north Africa, thanked Abbott for the contribution, saying the resettlement of refugees and extra funding were both ""very important and they go hand in hand"".  Related: This could be the largest refugee resettlement intake in Australia's postwar history - here's what it means But in a briefing for Australian MPs on Wednesday evening, Awad also underlined the severity of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. He noted there were more than 4m registered Syrian refugees in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and other countries. Many had been content being close to their home country for the past three or four years, hoping the situation would be resolved, but were now on the move and risking dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean sea because ""desperation had set in and hopelessness"". ""Children missed school for the last five years,"" Awad said, suggesting the education gap represented a lost generation. ""Five years is a long time."" Awad called for ""a peace agreement to stop all of this"". At the same briefing, the Unicef ambassador Tara Moss said until now it had ""been incredibly difficult to get the public's attention and the attention of change-makers"" about the plight of refugees in the region. ""The conflict in Syria is the world's largest humanitarian crisis today,"" she said. ""It is a children's crisis. More than half of the refugees are kids."" The World Vision Australia chief executive, Tim Costello, said people had been deeply moved by the pictures of Alan Kurdi, the boy found washed up on a beach in Turkey. ""That just pricked this bubble of indifference and suddenly we're going 'He's innocent; these people are innocent',"" Costello said. The Liberal MP Craig Laundy, who had been pushing for the government to increase its refugee intake, said he hoped ""that today we've seen the Australian heart"". ""The public have been shown what this [situation] looks like,"" he said. ""I hope today is the start of a conversation at a much more mature level that enables members of parliament to engage with the public in a way that transcends partisan politics and focuses on results.""

Donations from governments reached $16.4bn (£9.63bn) last year, a 24% rise from 2012 figures, says research group Development Initiatives (DI). Private donations - from corporations, foundations, individuals and trusts, usually in response to natural disasters - grew by 35% over the same period, according to preliminary estimates. Despite a record level of aid, Dan Coppard, director of research and analysis at DI, said: ""There is no place for complacency, with over a third of needs still not being met and demands set to rise in 2014 and beyond. As more actors provide assistance, we will need to improve the transparency of both humanitarian and other potential financial resources to target populations more effectively. ""Humanitarian assistance is only one small element of the total resources reaching crisis-affected countries, yet [it] continues to play a critical and unique function in providing a principled response to crisis-affected populations."" The UK and US were the top donors of humanitarian aid last year, while Turkey spent $1.6bn (£940m) on relief projects, mainly aimed at the 735,000 Syrian refugees living in the country, making it the third-largest donor. The Syrian conflict continued to be one of the most expensive humanitarian disasters with $3.1bn (£1.82bn) spent on shelter, food and emergency relief for refugees. After holding a Syria pledging summit, Kuwait increased its humanitarian spending more than any donor government, recording a 2,315% increase from last year. At the other end of the spectrum, Brazil's humanitarian spending dropped by 97%, while China cut aid by 84% and Russia's donations fell by 45%. ""Despite increases in total assistance, figures show that there are stark disparities in the scale of humanitarian response, resulting in a number of crises being forgotten,"" Coppard said. ""Just under a quarter of the total international humanitarian response went to the top five recipient countries, while other countries such as Nepal, [Burma] and Algeria continued to be de-prioritised."" Total donations are calculated by adding the humanitarian assistance expenditure of the 26 members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's development assistance committee, a group that directs aid flows from the world's largest economies, with relief spending by other countries as noted by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in its financial tracking service report, which records all reported international humanitarian funding and private sector spending. Sources for the figures come from a data set of 75 NGOs, annual reports for six UN agencies with humanitarian mandates - the UN children's fund, Unicef, UN Development Programme, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, the World Food Programme, and the World Health Organisation - and annual reports from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Researchers from Yale University say the women, living in north Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, are not able to access the basic reproductive healthcare they need. Those who are pregnant are not getting antenatal checks, while others have untreated infections. Some of their health problems are linked to conflict-related stress, which also manifests itself in domestic violence. Some women reported being hit by their husbands and also lashing out themselves at their children, which they bitterly regretted. ""I feel like I need a psychiatrist. I've been beating my child abnormally, and when he sleeps I regret it and cry, yet the next day I get tense and beat him again,"" said one woman. But while their situation is difficult, Amelia Masterson, lead author of the study in the journal BMC Women's Health, said the women support each other in their adversity. ""Though most of the stories we heard from Syrian women were grim, many women were facing hardship with great resilience and strength,"" she told the Guardian. ""Women spoke of helping each other out with basic needs, taking care of children while their husbands were away in Syria, and receiving help or even a place to stay from the local Lebanese population."" One of the women spoke of her gratitude to the people of Lebanon: ""Here, they give us hummus, pasta, beans, rice and canned food. We thank them and thank everyone who helped us including the people of Wadi Khaled, as we know they are not responsible for us."" Masterson and colleagues carried out a needs assessment at the request of the UN Population Fund. They interviewed 452 women, aged 18 to 45, who had been in Lebanon for an average of five months. The interviews were carried out between June and August 2012, when there were 48,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The situation is now likely to be even harder as the numbers have swollen and there are about a million refugees, a quarter of whom are women. Almost a third of the women - 139 - reported experiencing violence in the Syrian conflict and almost all of them (95.7%) said the perpetrator was armed. Fourteen said they had been subjected to sexual violence in Syria by an armed person. Seventy-four women had been pregnant during the conflict and just under half had delivered, the study says. Among the completed pregnancies, nearly a quarter (23.7%) had been pre-term births, four had been miscarriages or induced abortions (10.5%) and one baby died. There were complications in over a third (36.8%). Of those currently pregnant, more than a third (39.5%) reported problems such as severe abdominal pain, bleeding and fever.

Yet his article describes exactly why business as usual is not good enough for today's humanitarian crises. Throwing away the idea of independent, impartial and neutral humanitarian action is not the answer - yet a new way of working between humanitarian and development actors is urgently needed.  ""Everyone should be frustrated with the travesty of humanitarian solutions being applied to protracted problems. A camp for displaced persons is a good place to find shelter, nutrition and (hopefully) safety; it is a terrible place to call home and raise your children,"" wrote DuBois.  Indeed. Protracted crises are the new normal. Humanitarian appeals today last for 7 years on average and 89% of humanitarian financing goes to crises lasting more than 3 years. The most shocking statistic is that the average length of displacement is now 17 years. This is enough for a child to be born, schooled ( or not, tragically ) and reach adulthood. Doing so with nothing but basic, short-term humanitarian assistance is an outrage to the idea that all children in the world deserve development opportunities.  Related: Refugees don't just live in camps In a piece published by my institute last year, a group of UN agencies and the World Bank argued for a new approach to protracted displacement - one that recognises displaced people have a right to be connected with development.   Linking humanitarian action and development helps both  The idea is a simple one: humanitarian actors have an interest in connecting their populations of concern to development opportunities such as good quality education and jobs. Similarly, development actors have an interest in ensuring that they reach the furthest behind, which includes populations affected by humanitarian crises.  Getting humanitarian and development folks to work together in longstanding crises allows programmes to reach the most vulnerable, whether they are longstanding local residents or those displaced by humanitarian crises from another country or region. This is crucial for managing the politics of crises: it is difficult for Lebanese citizens, for example, to continue showing exceptional generosity to Syrian refugees if their government cannot show that extra education support will benefit poor local families too.  It also encourages more local capacity building. This is important because many of today's crises (eastern DRC or South Sudan, for example) repeat. A new way of working together can help build local institutions which are then able to respond to future crises.  When the bombs are still falling, it is a different story  By contrast, in acute crises - such as the situation today in much of Syria - what is needed is classic humanitarian emergency response. In these situations where fighting is high intensity, the imperative to save lives and alleviate suffering cannot easily be combined with any long-term focus.   Related: 'It's like trying to hit a football field from the top of Everest' - why aid airdrops just don't work As laid out in the UN Secretary General's report for the World Humanitarian Summit, the priorities are to press for political solutions to end the conflict, for respect of international humanitarian and human rights law by the combatants, and for humanitarian access. Humanitarian action will be, and should be, in traditional independent emergency response form. However, this does not mean no useful links with development actors can be made: they may have analysis and data to contribute.   Governments are part of the solution - not just the problem  DuBois underlines the link that development actors have with governments, and says that: ""Distrust will flare if you come with an agenda to address the causes of their suffering, reinforce national authorities or stabilise fragile states.""  Trust is key. But the critique ignores three things.  First, not all governments are distrusted. Humanitarians supported Indonesia's efforts to protect its citizens after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, for example, despite the Aceh conflict. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported that ""local solidarity and national assistance played by far the most important role in the acute emergency response phase."" Governments are the first responsibility holders of the right to protect, and where they are able to fulfil that responsibility they should be supported. Second, in conflicts where governments cannot play that role because they are party to a conflict, development actors have also adopted principles of "" do no harm "", avoiding the appearance or reality of partisan support or undermining national governance. They have civil society and community partners as well as governments, and they switch between different modes of operating depending on the circumstances.   Related: The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for' Third, conflict situations do not transition in a linear way from war to peace. If the ceasefire proceeds in Syria, there may be areas where local development activities can take place and link up with humanitarian action, alongside others where conflict requires an independent emergency response.  Conflict occurs on a spectrum, with many grey areas. Respect for humanitarian principles applies in all cases, but the form of humanitarian action - and its links with development - needs to adapt. The test is to make sure our principles can translate into the best results for people on the ground: in active conflict that means focusing on protection; but in lengthy crises it also means getting kids into school and giving them development hopes for the future.

The vessel, which can fit up to 2,500 people, will function as a floating registration centre. Officials hope its presence will speed up the processing of about 7,000 refugees who are stranded on Kos after making the short boat journey from Turkey, and to whom the authorities have been previously unable to provide paperwork or housing.  Related: 10 truths about Europe's migrant crisis The move follows a disastrous attempt to register refugees inside an old stadium on Tuesday and Wednesday, which led to up to 2,500 mainly Syrian migrants trapped in the stadium grounds. For more than 12 hours, much of it in temperatures of about 35C, migrants were without access to water or toilets. This led some to faint at a rate of one every 15 minutes, according to Médecins Sans Frontières, an aid agency providing medical support outside the stadium. By dawn on Thursday, the last migrants were finally released in calm circumstances witnessed by the Guardian, but some were literally bruised by the experience after clashes broke out on Wednesday between confused refugees and panicking police officers. Youssef, a 29-year-old Syrian banker, criticised the undignified nature of the process after being released early on Thursday morning. ""I have a bachelor's degree in accounting and an MBA,"" he said. ""It's a shame to treat us like this."" Registered migrants like Youssef are still stuck on Kos, with up to 5,000 others yet to be processed. The situation has led the Greek government to send a cruise liner, the Eleftherios Venizelos, to mitigate the fallout - as hundreds more refugees arrive every day. Kos's mayor, Giorgos Kyritsis, who made the decision to use the stadium, denied that the ship would simply be yet another place of limbo for refugees. Kyritis said: ""It's not going to be used as a camp. As soon as it is filled with migrants, the ship with depart and another ship will come."" Kos is one of several Greek islands to be overwhelmed this summer by the biggest wave of mass migration since the second world war. While record numbers of refugees are still arriving in Italy, Greece has overtaken its neighbour as the primary maritime entry point to Europe for migrants.

1188,src_theguardian_raw2.docx,The Guardian,12/10/2015,1264 words,Bruce Watson,How can companies integrate sustainable development goals?; The UN's sustainable development agenda for the next 15 years can be used as a model for businesses,"When the Syrian refugee crisis hit the news, global educational publisher Pearson wrote a check. But after sending £500,000 ($765,605) to aid relief efforts, the company began looking for more ways to make a more personal contribution. ""In big humanitarian crises like this, our usual answer is to make a philanthropic contribution,"" said Kate James, the company's corporate affairs officer. ""We're a global learning company. ""Conflict zones are not our area of expertise."" But as more information about the crisis poured in, it became clear that the flood of Syrian refugees included thousands of displaced children, many of whom would need educational assistance. This was a place where Pearson could help. Its contribution was to develop an educational program tailored to the needs of refugee children. Pearson didn't come to this conclusion on its own: its efforts were greatly influenced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were ratified in September. Designed to set the development agenda for the next 15 years, the SDGs are, in many ways, tailored for businesses that are looking to integrate sustainability into their business plan. At a recent meeting of the UN Private Sector Forum, UN Development Programme administrator Helen Clark emphasized this relationship between sustainability and corporations. ""[The SDG] requires very big partnerships, and the growth engine of the world economy is business,"" she said. Conversely, she pointed out, the SDGs have vast potential for improving the global business climate. By encouraging a ""solid enabling environment"", she explained, they also provide the basis for corporate growth. Michael Meehan, CEO of the Global Reporting Initiative, agreed. ""This is really about building trust not only in companies, but also in your markets, in your sectors and in the economy as a whole,"" he said at the forum. ""It's about adapting strategies and business models to rise above the fray of short-termism,"" he added. So business is important to the SDGs, and the SDGs are important to business. But how can companies integrate the SDGs into their business models in a way that is profitable and productive - and true to their core identity? Getting business involved There is a strong precedent for business involvement in UN-led sustainability initiatives. Lise Kingo, director of the UN Global Compact, pointed out that more than 12,000 organizations are signatories to the compact. As for the SDGs, she emphasized their usefulness to companies that are looking for long term investments. ""It's great for businesses to know what the priorities are,"" she said at the forum. ""And, with the new goals, we've also got a new platform for innovation and growth."" But, as the GRI's Meehan pointed out, it's easy to sign on to programs like the SDGs; integrating them into a business model is another matter entirely. As Peter Bakker, CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development illustrated at the forum, the mind-boggling breadth of the SDGs could be a hindrance to companies looking to integrate them. ""As beautiful as these goals are, as much as we all support what they stand for, 17 goals and 169 targets are too much for any businessperson to deal with,"" he said. ""How are we going to make the transformation beyond business as usual happen?"" Some companies have already begun integrating the SDGs into their business model - and using them to find ways to expand their offerings. Pearson's efforts with Syrian refugee children, for example, directly link the SDGs to the publisher's research and development program. In addition to fulfilling SDG 4, which exhorts companies to ensure ""inclusive and quality education for all"", Pearson's efforts also link to SDG 16, which calls for the promotion of peace, justice and strong institutions. When it came to creating an educational system that fulfilled both these goals, James said: ""We decided we needed a mobile solution we could scale, depending on the size of the crisis."" The company has committed another £1m ($1.53m) to researching and developing its new program. Right now, it is working with Save the Children, a charity that it has partnered with before, and is interviewing displaced parents and children, as well as people in the host countries. Ultimately, it hopes that its new educational program will be able to be easily adapted and quickly deployed to help children displaced by future crises. Enhancing a business model Kerry Adler, CEO of SkyPower Global, suggests another way that the SDGs could be integrated into a company's business model. SkyPower previously committed to build one gigawatt of solar electricity in Kenya over the next four years. As part of the SDGs, it committed to double that. The company is also getting involved in Kenya's infrastructure development. As part of its SDG commitment, it agreed to donate 3,600 solar powered LED streetlights for a 3,000km highway that the Kenyan government is planning. SkyPower's gifts will yield dividends for both Kenya and the company. ""We make the investment, which is estimated at $4bn,"" Adler explained. ""The installations generate energy, which we sell at the market price to the government's utility, which then distributes it to its customers."" By covering the initial installation costs, SkyPower has given itself a toehold in a market that is likely to expand - helped, in all likelihood, by the new highway the country is building. ""We've figured out how to build a large business, give a fair return to our shareholders, and make a substantial contribution to society for the life of the project,"" Adler said. Expanding the definition of society Other companies are doing SDG work in areas that are less directly related to their core business. For example, Tammy Medard, CEO of ANZ Bank (Lao) has decided to focus on SDG 5 : gender equality. At the UN event, she pledged that, by 2017, 40% of her bank's vendor panel will be women-run businesses. ""This is a near-impossible target in Lao,"" she said. ""I told this to my staff and they all started sweating, because they realized that the majority of our tenders were to IT services, none of which in Lao are run by women."" One long term solution that Medard's team came up with was to start planting the seeds for the next generation of women in tech. ""They agreed that they would go to high schools and talk to women about engagement in technology,"" she said. In the short term, Medard's team has sought gender parity in the businesses that they are reaching out to. ""We've added new businesses to the list of companies we seek bids from,"" she said. ""In just a few months, we've already seen improvement in our vendor gender balance."" While not directly related to ANZ Lao's business model, Medard's push for gender balance suggests a broader notion of society, as well as potential business partners for her community. ""Equality should be embedded in how we work and live; it should be agnostic to our strategy or business plan,"" she said.

1096,src_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,15/2/2016,942 words,Heaven Crawley and Sabir Zazai,"A refugee is for life, not just for Christmas; We should celebrate that the government has met its target to bring 1,000 refugees to the UK before Christmas, but the work is far from over","Around the same time that The Guardian launched its 2015 charity appeal - to a remarkable response - David Cameron announced he had met his pledge to bring the first 1,000 Syrian refugees to the UK before Christmas.  The prime minister's promise was made back in October, amid growing criticism of the government's response to the unfolding crisis in the Mediterranean. It followed an earlier announcement that the UK would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees after photographs of the body of three-year old Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach near Bodrum in Turkey - a harrowing image, which triggered a wave of public support and demands for the UK to do more to provide protection for those fleeing the conflict.  In this season of goodwill, the news that the first wave of refugees has been accommodated is to be welcomed but the sudden evolution of UK resettlement policy comes after years of foot dragging. The conflict in Syria, which started back in March 2011, has led to the deaths of around 250,000 people and displaced more than 10m, around 4.5m of whom have left the country.  Until January 2014, the government's policy was to be generous with humanitarian aid to Syria's neighbours rather than to accept refugees for resettlement. Then, under pressure from charities and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the government established a Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement (VPR) Programme to provide a route for selected Syrian refugees to come to the UK. The government committed itself to resettling ""several hundred"" Syrian refugees over a three-year period. Just 187 people were resettled in the period to June 2015.  A significant proportion of those people were resettled in Coventry, where the local response has been welcoming, supportive and inclusive, drawing on a high level of community support and committed community leadership teams.  This work has not always been easy or straightforward. Whilst the Home Office covers the direct costs associated with resettlement, it is down to local authorities to mobilise the necessary staff and local resources to find homes for families and school places for children. The fact that more than 50 local authorities have now done so is a significant achievement. But it is important to remember the scale of the crisis and how much more remains to be done.  Since the beginning of 2015 nearly 1 million people have crossed the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas in search of protection or a better life. Germany has taken in 760,000 asylum seekers this year with a third of all arrivals coming from Syria. The UK, protected from the crisis by its geographical location, will not participate in the refugee relocation schemes being developed by the EU to address the needs of those who have already arrived in Europe, arguing that this will simply encourage others to make the dangerous journey. And questions remain about what will happen once Christmas is over, when people return to their desks to find that the pressure to deliver the prime minister's vow is no longer driving the resettlement agenda. Will the efforts continue at the same pace? And will refugees be provided with the long-term support needed to rebuild their lives?  To be successful, resettlement must do more than meet immediate basic needs. One of the primary needs is to learn English which not only increases the chances of getting a job but also enables individuals to understand their rights and obligations as a citizen of a society and provides an opportunity to meet others in the community, reducing isolation. Yet across the country English language courses are being cut back due to the government's £45m cut in the Esol budget.  Refugees fleeing conflict and war have significant, and often unmet, mental health needs. Resettlement brings its own challenges: isolation from friends and family; guilt and anxiety about those left behind; poor living conditions; difficulties in accessing services; and hostility from some members of the community and sections of the British press (contrast that story with this one ). But the UK's mental health care system is in crisis and it seems unlikely that refugees will easily be able to access existing services.  Meanwhile the Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget which is being used to fund the programme can only be used to support people for their first 12 months in the UK. All of which raises important questions about how resettled refugees will get the long-term support that they need.  So as we head off to join our families and friends for a week of overindulgence, we should remember that for the Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the UK, one journey may have ended but another has only just begun. And it will last well beyond Christmas.  Ensuring that the UK meets its international obligations towards those fleeing the conflict in Syria will require more than prime ministerial pledges. We will all need to dig deep and find ways to harness the widespread public support shown over recent months to increase the scale and depth of our commitment.

Can a digital approach provide the solution?,"When a powerful earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010, Abasi Deroicier and her four children were left stranded. With her home and small business in ruins, she and her family relocated to the Tabbare Issa refugee camp run by the Red Cross in Port-au-Prince. Soon afterwards, she received an SMS message in Creole to her mobile phone. The message contained a transaction code, which she was able to redeem for $50 at her local remittance shop. The money enabled her to send her children to school and restart her clothing business.  In the days and weeks following the Haiti earthquake, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) co-ordinated the delivery of buckets, blankets, tarpaulins, kitchen sets and hygiene kits from its global warehouses. It also wanted to provide money to people like Abasi, to enable them to make purchases based on their individual needs.  Transferring cash to those in need is often more useful to recipients than ""in kind"" aid deliveries like food or blankets. ""It recognises the diverse needs of the affected populations"", said Scott DiPretoro, who works in the IFRC's Panama hub. ""It allows them to buy what they have prioritised as being most critical for their individual recovery."" As a result, it is increasingly popular among both providers and recipients. The IFRC responds to an average of 17 disasters each year throughout the Americas. According to an IFRC report, last year 30% of the disaster response and recovery operations in the IFRC Americas Zone included a cash transfer component. But the instability that permeates in the wake of any disaster makes it unsafe to carry large quantities of cash. ""If people find out that you're going to distribute cash, criminal elements can sometimes get involved so there's a very real threat to security not only to the Red Cross staff, but also to the beneficiaries that are intended to receive it,"" says Scott DiPretoro, who works in the IFRC's Panama hub. Digital transfers ensure greater security, speed and accountability. They may also provide a vehicle to promote financial inclusion. ""It can be the first time that you introduce someone to the formal banking system,"" says Marcella Willis of NetHope, an NGO which enables humanitarian organisations to make smarter use of technology. Despite its efficacy, transferring cash electronically is not without its problems. Identifying the most appropriate delivery mechanism, contracting the service provider and establishing procedures for its use can take a long time. In Haiti, the IFRC designed a tailor-made digital cash delivery mechanism from scratch to provide funds to beneficiaries like Abasi. The programme was ultimately successful, but the system took months to build and reached far fewer recipients than intended. These challenges prompted the IFRC to find a safer, quicker and more permanent solution. In 2013 it successfully applied for a Visa Innovation Grant, a fund for development and non-profit organisations seeking to adopt or expand the use of electronic payments to those living below the poverty line. Administered by NetHope, the grant program disburses $500,000 in funding each year. The IFRC proposed the establishment of a universal electronic cash transfer programme that would operate throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, rather than just across one country. In the event of a disaster it would enable aid workers to distribute prepaid cards quickly to people in need. The cards could then be used by recipients to withdraw cash from an ATM or purchase goods in local shops. The region is well suited to such a project. More than 80% of Latin Americans live in urban or semi-urban locations, with good access to ATMs and point-of-sale devices. The programme is progressing well. The IFRC has contracted a service provider to help coordinate cash transfers across the region, trained around 200 Red Cross personnel, and plans to pilot the new disaster response tool soon in order to be prepared for rapid implementation when the next disaster strikes. In a region that has witnessed humanitarian disasters ranging from landslides to cholera, that could come at any moment. The IFRC project complements others taking place around the world. Last year, the World Food Programme distributed prepaid cards to help feed hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. There's enormous potential for this initiative. But implementing a cash transfer programme on a global scale presents a variety of challenges. Conflicting financial regulations make the design of a unified processing system difficult. Finding a contractor willing to grapple with the issue, at a reasonable cost, takes time. Aid workers need support and in-depth training in order to use the system effectively. The IFRC project in Latin America and the Caribbean is a step towards a scaleable, transferable model which could one day be used around the world. ""If there was a larger-scale disaster in Asia, we could potentially implement the system based on our experience in the Americas,"" DiPretoro said. ""If we can standardise it, institutionalise it, it can really revolutionise the way that we provide assistance.""  Content managed and produced by Visa ",Broadsheet,0,2015-02,1,Aid

Yet Bradford is also a City of Sanctuary, which welcomed almost half of the Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the UK since March 2014. Of the 216 Syrians who came under the government's vulnerable persons relocation scheme, 106 ended up in Bradford. The West Yorkshire city is currently working out how it can house, school and care for the next tranche, who are soon to arrive from refugee camps on the Syrian border. While town hall administrators formulate a plan, a play is set to premiere at Bradford's main bus and train station celebrating the city's long history of immigration, which dates back to the 17th century Hugenots - French Protestants who suffered torture and mass killings under King Louis XIV.  Brief Encounters at Bradford Interchange is set among the toilets, waiting rooms and taxi rank of the rather grubby terminal. A promenade performance, it tells five stories based on real life conversations overheard by the playwright, Rav Sanghera, at the Interchange.  One follows British-born Pakistani Sam, who berates Ayoub, an aslyum seeker begging for change by the cab rank. ""Get a shop or summat. That's what my Dad had to do. He wouldn't have dreamt of begging,"" Sam tells Ayoub.  He then rants about the reality of life as a young Muslim man in Britain: ""I spend most of my life apologising. For people I don't even know. Saying sorry for any nutter that decides to blow themselves up or go on a killing spree. And have people looking at you. Suspicious. Like when you get asked to step aside at immigration at the airport cos you forgot to shave that day. And so you miss your flight home. When all you want to do is hug your wife and daughter. Watch EastEnders, and have a chip buttie."" Another scene eavesdrops on Mo and Sharon, two bus drivers whose cross-racial friendship has raised eyebrows at the Interchange and particularly among Mo's conservative Muslim family. One more features Maggie, an elderly German Jewish refugee with kleptomaniac tendencies, who is befriended by a young Polish migrant. The work was commissioned by Freedom Studios, a Bradford-based theatre company that aims to help eradicate racism and prejudice by connecting different people and communities through making theatre and telling stories . Director Tom Wright said the play aims to confront the highs and lows of Bradford's ever more diverse communities. ""We wanted to explore what it means to open up a city to those people who are suffering, and to explore the tensions and resistance which results."" His cast is broadly representative of Bradford's inner city districts, with three white British characters, three Asian characters and two white Europeans. ""That was very definitely part of the mission statement from the beginning,"" he said. Jane Steele, a Bradford-based actor of Trinidadian and Wakefield descent, said she hoped the play would showcase her adopted city's warmth: ""The other day I was on a bus and there was an old lady struggling to get on. Everybody on that bus, black, white, Muslim, Asian, stood up to help her. ""I've never known such sideless generosity. Yes, of course Bradford's got its problems. I'm not going to pretend it's Brigadoon. But it's beautiful and it's rising from the ashes now.""  Brief Encounters at Bradford Interchange runs 6-10 October. Tickets £10/£5 plus booking fee.

The quota for Australia's initial additional resettlement of 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq - external to its annual humanitarian intake of 13,750 - has been filled.   All 12,000 visas have been assigned, according to the latest federal government figures, and more than 10,400 refugees have arrived in the country as part of the program.   Related: Malcolm Turnbull tells Russia to pull Bashar al-Assad into line after US missile strikes Oxfam Australia's chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke, said that, ""considering the success"" of Australia's resettlement of the initial 12,000, and the ongoing outflow of refugees fleeing the conflict, the Australian government was well-placed to resettle more people.  ""The international community seems intent on watching on as millions of people are stuck between the rock that their country has become and the hard place that exile offers them,"" she said.  ""Oxfam calls on rich countries to show their support for Syria's neighbours that have welcomed these refugees and to resettle at least the most vulnerable 10% of Syrian refugees by the end of 2017."" A former Australian ambassador to Syria, Bob Bowker, said Australia was in a position to accept more refugees from the conflict in that country. ""I would like to see Australia doing much more to accept Syrian refugees that have been assessed as such and provide more support in local communities to assist their settling into Australia.""  Bowker, plenipotentiary to Damascus from 2005 to 2008, said ""the Australian community will benefit"" from accepting more refugees - particularly those that are well-supported in their initial months in the country - and that the experience of the current cohort was that younger refugees adapt better, and more quickly, to their new country.  But he said Australia needed to accept refugees from the conflict on the basis of those in most acute need of protection, not on any sectarian division.  ""Our response needs to be based on our common humanity, not on the basis of religious affiliation.""  Australia's one-off additional resettlement program, announced by the then prime minister, Tony Abbott, in September 2015, has been widely hailed as a success, though it has not been without controversy.   Related: Malcolm Turnbull says al-Assad's 'war crimes' disqualify him from future role in Syria  Initially, Australia's pace of resettlement lagged well behind comparable countries such as the US and Canada. In the same 12 months those countries had settled 10,000 and 30,000 refugees under additional intakes respectively, Australia had accepted just 2,000.  There were also concerns that Australia, in identifying persecuted minorities for resettlement, had preferenced Christians over refugees of other religions.  Both Iraq and Syria are Muslim-majority countries and, while Christians in those nations face religious persecution, Muslims, both from sectarian minorities and majorities, are also significantly persecuted. There was concern that, once in Australia, too many refugees were being resettled in too few areas : in particular Fairfield and Liverpool in Sydney's west, Hume in north-western Melbourne and Logan, south of Brisbane. In February, the Fairfield city mayor, Frank Carbone, said his council had resettled one fifth of all of Australia's humanitarian migrants last financial year. Nearly 5,000 refugees moved into the area, the equivalent of an entire suburb's population. ""More funding needs to be provided locally for better coordination of services and to ensure job creation, housing, health and youth services are adequate,"" he said. Governments, state and federal, responded, with additional funding for resettlement, health and education services. The federal government has sought to reform and streamline its humanitarian settlement program, to prioritise integration and independence. "" Central to this reform is improving English, education and employment outcomes, ensuring humanitarian arrivals have the best chance at thriving in Australia,"" the assistant minister for social services, Zed Seselja, said.",Broadsheet,0,2017-04,1,Migration

This was no normal Sunday service for the congregation of the Cornerstone Baptist church, who gather each week at the local primary school in Thame, south Oxfordshire.  Sunday's service was dedicated to the plight of refugees, mainly Syrian, but those from Eritrea and elsewhere too. The pastor, Paddy Harris, had thrown open the doors to all in the local community, to anyone troubled, especially by recent tragic images, including that of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi. To anyone that wanted to find a way to help, he said. Now, more than 100 people - parents with young children, teenagers, elderly people, a whole cross section - had gathered.  ""I'm hoping it will show me ways to act, guide towards a practical solution,"" said Sally Hobson, 39, a community paediatrician and regular church attendee, whose heart had been telling her to do something but she wasn't quite sure what. Amanda Clarke, 46, a barrister and part-time judge, agreed. ""I'm hoping it will inspire us towards a more positive way forward,"" she said. Thame is a small town, in one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, whose former MPs include Boris Johnson and Michael Heseltine. Here, as in many communities across the UK, the scale of the humanitarian refugee crisis was appreciated. The question to be addressed on Sunday, though, was what they could each do.  Each lit a candle, said a personal prayer, then sat in silence as Krish Kandiah, a member of the church's leadership committee who works for the charity Home For Good, played a video appeal he had filmed. How could they help? They could pray, he told them. Or pledge money. Anyone with a property for rent could make it available to the local council for refugees. Perhaps they could foster an unaccompanied minor. Or find other ways to help integrate refugees into their community. The image of tiny Aylan, whose lifeless body cradled by a Turkish police officer went around the world last week, was not shown. But others, stark images of walking lines of the displaced, and the bombed-out places they once called home, conveyed just as powerful a message.  When the film finished, Kandiah stood in front of the hushed congregation and asked them to discuss how they might act positively. ""We need to be careful that we act well and not just out of a sense of panic,"" he cautioned.  This is a cafe-style church, with people sitting informally on chairs, some with coffee. As they turned to each other to talk, the younger children at the back busily coloured in a huge banner, reading ""Refugees Welcome"".  Mike Hill, a senior officer with the Metropolitan police, believed the horrific picture of Aylan, and the tragedy that led to the death of him, his mother and his five-year-old brother, had shocked the nation into awareness that the government's policies are not looking after the most vulnerable people.   Related: Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers: what's the difference? From the service he hoped for ""a better understanding"". He said: ""We see those horrible pictures. We know what is happening, It's where can we best galvanise our action, manage resources to best effect.""  Like many of those gathered, he believed the government's response had been slow, but he welcomed recent changes increasing the number of Syrian refugees that Britain will take.  Hugh Tulloch, 79, a retired local government officer, believed David Cameron had been ""coerced into it by the general feeling"".  ""The government has changed [its stance],"" said Clarke. ""I guess it's a good outcome from a rubbish situation. That it had to get to that point before it changed is tragic.""  Harris chose ""Home"" as the theme of his sermon. Today, he added, was about those who no longer had a safe place to call home.  ""I think it is a dilemma for Christians,"" said Steve Paver, 48, who is originally from South Africa and who described himself as ""an economic migrant "".  ""The temptation is the quick and easy actions and the short-term needs. And that is important, but it's going to be a long-term problem,"" he said.

The first item is about human trafficking and underage marriage among Syrian refugees in Jordan. Next up is an interview with the mayor of Ramtha, a Jordanian border town whose economy has been paralysed by the war raging in Syria. And finally a listener phones in to complain about begging by Syrians in the northern city of Mafraq. This familiar mix represents another day in the life of Suriyoun Baynana (Syrians Among Us), a programme designed to help one small Arab country cope with the enormous strain caused by the crisis ravaging its larger neighbour. Hosted by Radio Balad, a community radio network, it covers the refugee story while trying to counter hostility towards the million-plus Syrians who have fled to Jordan since the uprising against Bashar al-Assad erupted in 2011. The existence of the programme is itself a rare bit of good news in the general gloom about Syria. Hazem al-Mazouni, a democracy activist in Hama before he escaped, now reports on the lives of his fellow countrymen in exile even as the Jordanian authorities implement tougher policies. Right now his concern is about thousands of refugees who are stranded in no man's land near a remote desert border post, facing snakes, scorpions and unbearable uncertainty about the future. ""They are having to manage on one 200ml bottle of water a day,"" Mazouni says. ""Eight people have died there in the last two months, and one of them was a seven-year-old child."" Radio Balad has no shortage of news. ""People here are surprised to hear about how hard the situation is for the Syrian refugees,"" says Doha Barqawi, a Jordanian editor. ""We have a lot of reports about violence against women and children and problems in schools. It's all bad."" The UNHCR records 640,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan, though the government says the total number of Syrians is double that. The costs are huge for a poor country that is short of water, faces crippling energy costs and suffers the highest youth unemployment in the Arab world. Many schools are operating double shifts to accommodate Syrian children. Health services are overwhelmed. Syrians, many of them highly skilled, are prepared to work for lower wages than Jordanians and even Egyptian guest workers. Rents and prices have risen astronomically. Unhappiness, frustration and anger are heard everywhere. ""We have received the lower end of Syrian society,"" complains a middle-class Palestinian. ""In Arabic we say a fish stinks after three days. But this could go on for years."" The Syrians are the third big wave of refugees to enter Jordan since independence in 1946. First came the Palestinians - those who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948, and a second exodus in the wake of the 1967 war. Iraqis arrived in 1991 and again in 2003. The uprising against Assad opened another massively disruptive chapter. ""The problem with Jordan,'"" an Amman-based diplomat says drily, ""is that refugees do tend to stay."" Jordan has been widely praised for its efforts - and received substantial cash flows to help it cope - but its patience is clearly running out. Lebanon, which has taken in 1.2 million Syrians, announced this month that it was barring entry to all but ""exceptional"" cases. The Jordanian government insists its border remains open. But a marked change has taken place in the last few weeks. The UNHCR recorded 6,000 refugees in September and just 250 in November. ""The numbers have petered out,"" says one official. ""They have slowed from a trickle to almost nothing."" Security concerns explain why. For the first two years of the crisis, most Syrians entering Jordan came from central and southern Syria, especially the Dera'a area. In recent months the two westernmost border crossings were closed, so newer arrivals came from further north and east, from around Aleppo, Hassake and Deir el-Zor - partially or wholly under the control of the Islamic State. ""In the end the security imperative is overwhelming the humanitarian arguments,"" says Andrew Harper, head of the UNHCR's busy office in Amman. The irony is that the UNHCR now has spare capacity in a new camp near Azraq, built when the first one at Zaatari was full. Jordanian officials bristle at criticism, arguing that EU countries are in no position to preach about refugee policy when they have just ended support for the Mare Nostrum operation to rescue migrants from drowning in the Mediterranean. ""Do we have to prove our credentials?"" asks Mohammed al-Momani, the government's chief spokesman. ""We are doing more than any other country in the world."" Rumours abound of Jordan working with the anti-Assad Free Syrian Army to keep refugees away from the border. Officials in Amman point out that emergency food deliveries by the UN, now being made without the agreement of the Syrian government, are relieving pressure. Evidence is accumulating of efforts by the Jordanian authorities to force Syrians to move from private accommodation into camps or face deportation. Human Rights Watch said in late November that the Jordanian authorities had forcibly deported vulnerable Syrian refugees back to Syria, in violation of Jordan's international obligations. Last week it was reported that medical care was being denied to refugees. The issue is certain to come up in talks between King Abdullah and Barack Obama in Washington this week. ""Jordan has done far more than anyone could have possibly expected a small state to do,"" the UNHCR's Harper says. ""It has done an outstanding job, but there are limits to its capacity. If we are struggling in 2014 to find the resources, where will we be in 2015 and 2016 and beyond? No one has a timeline for this conflict.""",Broadsheet,0,2014-12,1,Conditions

This is despite the fact the closures are in violation of international law and the UN has warned of the "" devastating consequences "" they will have. Over 600,000 residents will be displaced, putting them at immediate risk. Moreover the forced closure betrays the most basic refugee rights, and can only lead to countless human rights violations as refugees returning to their home countries face grave consequences. Kenya's decision is not without precedent. In 2012, the Tanzanian government closed Mtabila refugee camp, forcing its 35,000 Burundian inhabitants to find a new home back in Burundi, the country rife with violent conflict from which they'd fled. Violence in Burundi has since forced over 250,000 residents to seek safety in neighbouring countries -137,000 of those back in Tanzania. Yet Kenya's situation is a symptom of a larger, more fundamental issue. The core of the problem is that camps are the foundation of the international community's refugee response strategy. They have become the target for the bulk of humanitarian aid. Camps have become the beginning, and in many cases the end, of international support to the swelling refugee crisis.   Related: The volunteers turning refugee lifejackets into symbols of hope Camps, as their name suggests, are intended to be temporary solutions. Yet this is rarely the case: Dadaab and Kakuma for example are 25 years old. Dadaab was built in 1992 to provide temporary housing for 90,000 refugees fleeing Somalia's violent civil war. It is now the largest refugee camp in the world - and Kenya's third largest ""city"".  Kenya's situation underscores the urgent need to find sustainable alternatives to camps, as well as find sustainable solutions for the millions of urban refugees who have either left or chosen to avoid them. Today, more than half of the global refugee population - an estimated 60% - reside in urban areas, not camps. And an overwhelming majority - 86% - reside in developing countries. And in these urban areas, NGOs around the globe are illustrating the possibility of creating alternatives to refugee camps. Their programmes strive to make it possible for refugees to achieve independence from international aid, find dignified living conditions, and establish long-term livelihoods while benefiting their host communities in myriad ways.  Related: Why we urgently need more collaboration to solve long-term humanitarian crises  One programme in Kenya, for example, provides shelter and support to refugee women and children, who comprise more than half of the global refugee population and are at grave risk of sexual and gender-based violence. The safe house provides 24-hour security as well as vital counselling services, medical and legal assistance, and a supportive community for residents. The programme also facilitates positive exit strategies for residents, linking them to long-term living arrangements and sustainable care within the local community.  Another programme in Irbid, Jordan creates housing for the city's continual influx of Syrian refugees. In Irbid, housing has been a persistent issue. While cash-for-rent programmes provide temporary solutions for refugees, they drive up rent prices on the local housing market and make life even more difficult for locals and refugees alike. The Irbid programme is supported by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), provides funding for local landlords to complete construction on multi-story buildings, creating housing for refugees while stimulating the local economy. So far, over 3,800 housing units have been created for over 8,700 refugees, with over 8,000 more on a waiting list as the NRC expands to other urban areas throughout Jordan.  Related: Refugees don't just live in camps Beyond NGO programmes like these, countless community-based organisations provide vital support. Often the only source of support for urban refugees, these organisations are usually led by refugees themselves and illustrate the power of a reciprocal relationship between refugees and their host countries.  One example is the Young African Refugees for Integral Development (Yarid), which has been serving the refugee community in Kampala, Uganda since 2008. Yarid's founders, refugees who escaped violence in the DRC and resettled in Uganda, were inspired to create the organisation after witnessing firsthand the struggles of fellow refugees. Today, Yarid is a thriving community, tackling social issues including unemployment, public health, and ethnic conflicts, and providing vital education services to urban refugees from central Africa. However, scarce resources and an absence of international support mean these organisations struggle to survive.  Today, one in every 122 people is someone who has been forced to flee their homes. The crisis is real - and Kenya's situation is just one example of how precarious our global reliance on encampment has become. If we want alternatives to work, we need to invest in what's working.  Refugee camps aren't working - but a host of programmes around the world are. It's time for the international community to demonstrate its commitment to resolving the global refugee crisis by investing in solutions that hold real promise.

So far this year, 2,400 men, women and children have lost their lives in the central Mediterranean, including 13 people found dead at the bottom of an overcrowded dinghy this week. This ought to be intolerable, and yet the governments of Europe tolerate it, because they appear to lack the political will to deal with it. Mr Grafmanns was speaking about a disagreement over new rules to be presented by the Italian government on Monday that charities say will restrict their capacity to rescue refugees during the peak crossing season. But this is only the latest instance of a policy of reaction, containment and buck-passing that characterises the approach of all European Union nations including the UK. Mr Grafmanns makes explicit what many suspect, that the EU believes that, if the rescue effort in the Mediterranean is too effective, it would encourage even more people to attempt the crossing. Of course, there is an element of truth in this, but nothing could justify a policy of allowing people to drown to discourage the others. The death toll in the central Mediterranean ought, instead, to act as a spur to a bigger and more effective effort at all levels to deal with the refugee crisis. Italian  coastguard  rescues refugee boat from Libya in the Mediterranean That ought to mean a policy focused on aid and education at source, to try to discourage people in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African nations from heading towards Libya in the first place. Then there is our collective responsibility to the people of Libya themselves: having helped turn Libya into a failed state by the Nato intervention in 2011, we ought to do more to help fix it. The UK's assistance to the Libyan coastguard must be part of this, but so far it has not done enough to stop human rights abuses, as a House of Lords report found this month. Ultimately, the objective of policy ought to be something similar to the deal that the EU has with Turkey: in effect a large amount of money for Turkey to deal with Syrian refugees close to source. It may seem crude and even cynical, but it is better than a policy that countenances thousands of people drowning each year. The refugee crisis on Europe's southern borders is one of the great humanitarian challenges of the age, and  The Independent  believes that the UK shares a moral responsibility to help solve it. Whether we are a member of the EU or not, we are members of the human race and part of the wider community of nations.

John Spicer said the images that emerged last week of Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach in Turkey brought back difficult memories from his own past trying to help dying refugees in the Middle East. He and his son Frank have registered with an online scheme to put up a refugee family in their three-bed house in Thanet, Kent.  Now he hopes his gesture may ""inspire other people"" to do the same. Speaking exclusively to The Independent, Frank Spicer said he asked his father about it yesterday and that he was now ""in the spare room - he's started sorting it out already"". John was in the reserves at the end of the Second World War but did not get the chance to fight, while his brothers and friends all did. Out of ""embarrassment"" he signed up as soon as the war finished - and was stationed in what was then British-administrated Palestine. ""Funnily enough, he was helping refugees at that time too,"" Frank said. ""The horrible thing was that this same situation with drowning refugees was going on then. ""They had the Arabs attacking on one side because part of their land was being taken away, and on the other side they were so overwhelmed with Jewish refugees that they couldn't let them all in.

After signing up to the Homes for Syrians website, Frank posted an image of John dressed up with his medals for last year's Remembrance Day service on a Facebook group in support of refugees in Calais. The image of his father struck a chord on the group - ""went a little bit viral"", as he put it, and he said that's a good thing. ""We'd like it to inspire other people.

They wereset to cave in to fresh demands from Turkey for an extra (EURO)3bn in aid - double the previously agreed figure - to help prevent Syrian refugees leaving Turkish soil. The last-minute demands came as EU leaders met in Brussels to try and agree measures to halt the flow of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The aid would be provided until the end of 2018 to help Ankara shelter the estimated 2.5 million Syrians currently living in Turkey, rather than wave them on towards the EU. It is part of a package, negotiated with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, that comes with the promise of visa-free travel for Turks wishing to visit Europe by the end of June, at least four months earlier than planned, if Ankara agrees to introduce biometric passports.  It also includes plans for a resettlement scheme under which the EU would admit one Syrian refugee for every Syrian taken back by Turkey from the Greek islands. Turkey would also readmit all ""irregular"" migrants - those who do not qualify for refugee status - who cross into Greek islands from Turkey. Mr Davutoglu used the summit to push for an acceleration of talks on Turkish membership of the EU. ""Turkey is ready to work with the EU, and Turkey is ready to be a member of the EU as well,"" he said. He also said Turkey wanted the EU to help establish humanitarian safe zones inside Syria for refugees. Read more Turkey's argument on refugees is about pride - not just money The EU offer came after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused it of failing to live up to the (EURO)3bn deal agreed last November to help Turkey deal with its influx of refugees. ""It's been four months. They are yet to deliver,"" he said. ""My Prime Minister is currently in Brussels. I hope he will return with the money."" Mr Erdogan said Turkey had spent about (EURO)10bn on the Syrian refugees living in the camps since 2011, and was struggling to meet the needs of a growing number of refugees. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU should try to slash the flow of migrants entering illegally ""and not just for a few countries, but for all countries. That means for Greece too."" She said there had to be a ""sustainable solution"" that involved protecting the EU's external borders, and ""that can only be done in cooperation with Turkey"". David Cameron said that Britain would not join a common asylum process in Europe (AFP) However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the EU should shut its borders to migrants completely because any resettlement plan would only add ""fuel to the fire"" and cause more people to come. The summit comes three days after the Turkish government's seizure of Zaman, the country's largest daily newspaper. But the EU was careful not to tie the crackdown with Ankara's demands. Prime Minister David Cameron raised concerns about press freedom with Mr Davutoglu during the summit, an official said, noting that he underlined the importance of protections for a free press and human rights.  French President François Hollande added that ""co-operation with Turkey doesn't mean accepting everything from Turkey"".

Ms Merkel said she would block any agreement to permanently close borders. Meanwhile, Mr Cameron pledged that Britain would not take part in a planned common EU asylum policy.

Although all EU member states can ask for a share of the fund, it is expected to be channelled to Greece, where most refugees are landing by boat, as well as the Balkan countries through which they travel on their way to western Europe. The United Nations' refugee agency said more than 27,000 refugees were in need of permanent shelter in Greece, and 2,000 a day were arriving there from Turkey.

Officials said that although the aid was normally used for emergencies outside Europe, it could be used internally if member states found that their own response capacities were overwhelmed. More and more EU countries have re-imposed border controls to stop refugees passing through. Mr Tusk admitted that the pressure was piling up, especially in the EU's border-free Schengen zone. ""It is a crisis that is testing our union to the limits,"" he said, after meeting the Croatian Prime Minister, Tihomir Oreskovic, in Zagreb.

EU officials have voiced concerns that the newly built frontiers and temporary border checks could eventually become permanent.

Ferries carrying migrants to the Greek mainland, where many continue their journey onwards to western Europe, have not been running for four days because of an industrial dispute. The stoppage has disrupted the chaotic flow of refugees on the island, seeing its two registration camps pushed to their limits while thousands of asylum seekers sleep rough or in ramshackle tents lining the port in Mytilene, hoping to make the first departure. Officials from the United High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said at least 10,000 people were likely to be trapped on Lesbos by the end of the week, although estimates of the number ran to more than double that amount in the Greek media. Alessandra Morelli, UNHCR's senior operations coordinator for Greece, told  The Independent  that three ferries with a combined capacity of 5,000 were standing ready to start transfers to Athens as soon as the strike is due to end at 6am on 6 November. ""Lesbos isn't meant to cater for this - it's meant to cater for tourists,"" she added. ""The infrastructure is poor. It's an extraordinary situation."" Thousands of asylum seekers are still arriving on flimsy dinghys from Turkey every day, despite worsening weather conditions exacerbating the risk of accidents like the one that killed three children on 4 November. The new arrivals can be seen walking for miles in endless streams along the island's roads, as well as waiting for buses in hundreds-strong crowds, all heading for Lesbos' two registration centres. But Kara Tepe - for Syrians - and Moria - for asylum seekers from other nations - are struggling to deal with rapidly rising numbers trapped on the island in worsening conditions by the ongoing strike. ""They are stretched to the limit but they aren't cracking yet,"" Ms Morelli said, describing work to increase capacity with more cabins and new airport-style reception areas to make the process ""effective and dignified"". The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, was on hand to witness the effect of the bottleneck while visiting the Moria refugee camp with the European Union President, Martin Schulz, today. Many of its 4,000 current inhabitants, mainly from Afghanistan, were sleeping in tents or on the bare ground while struggling with limited supplies and risking infection from overflowing latrines. Refugees were held behind crowd barriers as the Prime Minister and Mr Schulz passed through, surrounded by a crowd of media and minders. But one man managed to make his voice heard, shouting: ""We are here three days. We are hungry. I have two children, my children are sick."" ""We will do our best,"" Mr Tsipras replied, patting his arm before being ushered away. Efforts by his shipping minister to persuade union leaders not to extend their strike, which was originally scheduled for 48 hours, failed but the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) has committed to re-starting transfers tomorrow. The nationwide strike has seen ferries docked across Greece, on routes used by local people, businesses, cargo and tourists. Organisers said they had no new demands but were taking a stand against the government's bailout agreement and austerity measures, opposing pension cuts and rising unemployment rates in the shipping industry. Mr Tsipras, who saw a refugee boat arrive while journeying through Lesbos, called it a ""suffocating situation"". Meanwhile, the number of arrivals stands at around 5,000 a day and is not expected to go down as weather conditions worsen through the winter, with smugglers reportedly offering off-season discounts. UNHCR figures show that of the almost 609,000 asylum seekers reaching Greece this year, 353,000 arrived in Lesbos - which has a native population of just 86,000. Ms Morelli said the UN would ""not let its guard down"", while Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, the Red Cross, Oxfam, International Rescue Committee and numerous other charities and volunteer groups are running their own operations.

Writing about the research, Local Government Chronicle editor Nick Golding said: ""The British government's offer was initially limited to funding humanitarian assistance in the countries surrounding Syria to which the vast majority of refugees fled. ""Public disquiet eventually forced it to promise sanctuary to 20,000 refugees deemed particularly vulnerable. It falls to councils to offer places to refugees in each area."" He said councils in Gloucestershire, Kent and Lancashire ""deserve particular credit"" for taking in hundreds of refugees, but said not every area can provide equal assistance. ""Some are already struggling to manage the impact of immigration,"" he said. ""Some, especially in London, are unable to offer housing support to people who grew up locally, such is the pressure on housing. ""Whenever there is significant new immigration, it is essential that communities remain cohesive.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-07,0,Aid

3933,src_theindependent_raw5.docx,The Independent,23/1/2016,758 words,LEO CENDROWICZ IN BRUSSELS,Could the refugee crisis really break up the European Union?,"Yesterday's 43 new deaths by drowning in the Aegean Sea brought Europe's migration crisis sharply back into focus just as the French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, warned that unless the flow of refugees is better managed, it could cause the break-up of the European Union. How serious is the refugee crisis? More than a million migrants and refugees came to Europe last year, mostly via Turkey. Although winter was expected to slow the pace, 35,000 have arrived in the first three weeks of January, compared with 1,600 for the whole month last year. How has the EU responded? There have been many initiatives since last spring, and EU leaders have discussed the issue at six separate summits, but most measures have been inadequate or slow, or both. They include relocation and resettlement efforts, a new border control police, and a deal with Turkey to stop refugees heading to Europe. What went wrong with relocation? The plan to relocate 160,000 people more evenly across the EU was immediately controversial, as eastern countries like Hungary pointed out that refugees wanted to go to Berlin, not Budapest. The results are pitiful: only 331 have been relocated since September. The plans to resettle refugees from outside Europe have not been much better: only 779 of the 5,331 due in 2015 had been effectively resettled. What is being done to police the EU's borders? Last month, EU leaders backed plans for a European Border and Coast Guard, aimed mainly at Greece and Italy, where most refugees have landed. It would ensure asylum-seekers are screened and register before a decision is taken on whether they can stay. It will come too late for most leaders. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: ""We need to get a grip on this issue in the next six to eight weeks."" Can Turkey help? The EU signed a Euro 3bn (£2.3bn) deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow. Turkey is hosting 2.2 million refugees from Syria, Iraq and other war zones. But EU finance ministers have yet to agree who should pay; EU officials complain Turkey is not playing its part and Ankara says the Euro 3bn isn't enough. Does migration hurt Europe? Economically, it is a boon: an IMF report on Wednesday said EU states that take in the most people will get the biggest windfall - worth an extra 1.1 per cent growth in Austria, Germany, and Sweden by 2020. Migrants may also fill the demographic shortfall from Europe's shrinking population. The EU's active labour force of 240 million would fall to 207 million by 2050, even if migration runs at the present level. If it halts, the workforce would shrink to 169 million. Why did Germany open and then close its doors? The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, earned world-wide praise for inviting Syrian refugees to come to her country. But a political backlash at home forced her to change tack, closing Germany's borders. The mood has further soured after New Year's Eve assaults on women in Cologne, blamed on Muslim migrants. Will the crisis bring Europe's borders back? The passport-free Schengen zone across much of the EU is being severely tested. Six countries - Austria, Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark and non-EU member Norway - have reintroduced temporary border checks. The European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warns dismantling Schengen would cost £2.3bn a year in lost business. The European Council President Donald Tusk says unless the EU makes progress in the next two months, Schengen could fail. What about Greece, the weak link in the refugee trail? Under EU rules, asylum-seekers must register in the first safe country they reach. But this ""Dublin"" regulation put huge administrative burdens on Greece and Italy, and is widely ignored: most refugees arrive on deserted beaches and travel by land to countries like Germany and Sweden. A rule change due in March may replace this with a quota system. Would this mean more migrants come to Britain? It's unlikely to affect the relatively few asylum-seekers who enter the UK, which has no land border with Europe and retains border checks. Britain has an opt-out on asylum policy, so could choose not to apply it. Britain's share of asylum claims has fallen to 3.5 per cent last year. But it would mean renegotiating the associated rules under which Britain returns 1,000 migrants a year to the country where they first arrived. Could this all affect Britain's renegotiation with the EU? David Cameron aims to cut the number of EU citizens travelling to Britain to work, not asylum-seekers. But the crisis plays into the hands of those seeking the UK's withdrawal.",Broadsheet,0,2016-01,0,Migration

Today, however, the 25-year-old refugee is among a group of his compatriots facing deportation from Britain to eastern Europe. Their numbers may be small, but they are vulnerable, and frightened. Formerly a reluctant soldier for the Assad regime, Muhammed left his native Aleppo for Turkey in September 2012 with the aim of reaching ""safety"" in Britain, where he says he has cousins. He paid people smugglers to get him to Hungary - where he says was beaten and kept in solitary confinement - before continuing on his journey through Austria, Italy and France, arriving in Dover on the back of a lorry in July 2013 and quickly being detained. Like other Syrians in British custody he is facing a return to eastern Europe under the EU's controversial Dublin regulation - which allows member states to return asylum seekers to the first European country they entered - despite the Government moving to accept 500 Syrian refugees after a campaign by aid agencies and The Independent. Refugee charities and human rights bodies, including Amnesty International UK, Human Rights Watch, Refugee Action and the Refugee Council, have condemned the British Government practice of detaining and returning some Syrian refugees. Muhammed said he is ""terrified"" of being returned to ""squalid conditions"" and ""poor treatment"" in Hungary, where he will likely have to be return. Speaking through an interpreter, he described how he was detained in Hungary on his arrival last year and was kept in solitary confinement, ""punched like a boxer's bag"" by police, ""stripped naked"" and only fed once a day until he agreed provided his fingerprints to asylum authorities. The Independent was unable to verify all of Muhammed's claims, but charities suggest his tale is not unusual. Jerome Phelps, director of Detention Action, said that ""traumatised people are facing removal to third countries where conditions are very poor"" and that they are ""being detained in a prison-like environment in the UK beforehand"". Muhammed said he was disappointed with Britain and had not expect to be ""treated like a criminal"". Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International UK have condemned the failure to sufficiently reform the controversial Dublin regulation and raised concerns over conditions for refugees returned to countries on the border of the EU, including Bulgaria, Italy, Greece and Hungary. A recent Amnesty International report also highlighted the UNHCR's concerns over Hungary's treatment of asylum seekers. The country accepted 18,000 Syrian refugees last year but there have been reports of poor conditions in reception centres and reports that conditions in detention fall short of international and EU standards. The Home Office says individual are only detained if there is a realistic prospect of their removal, but has refused to rule out the return of Syrians under the Dublin Regulation.

Prosecutors said the three suspects were dispatched to Germany last year ""either to carry out a mission that they had been informed about or to wait for further instructions"". They were named as Mahir al-H, 17, Ibrahim M, 18, and Mohamed A, 18, with their surnames redacted according to German privacy laws. ""Concrete missions or orders have not yet been found in the course of investigations carried out so far,"" a spokesperson for the federal prosecutor said. Thomas de Maiziere, the German interior minister, said the men could be part of a ""sleeper cell"" linked to the terrorists who carried out the Paris attacks that killed 130 people in November. ""Everything points to the same smuggling organisation as with the Paris attackers having brought these three who were arrested to Germany,"" he added. ""And everything points to the travel documents having come from the same workshop."" The arrests were made during a series of dawn raids involving 200 officers, with police searching refugee centres in Gro??hansdorf, Ahrensburg and Reinfeld in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Investigators said the 17-year-old suspect had been trained to use guns and handle explosives in Isis' de-facto capital of Raqqa before crossing into Europe on the refugee route from Turkey to Greece. The trio, carrying false passports, left Syria in October 2015 - around the same time as at least two of the Paris suicide bombers who crossed to the island of Leros. They reached Germany in November and have received four-figure payments in US dollars from Isis, as well as mobile phones with pre-installed communication apps. More than a million refugees and asylum seekers arrived in Germany last year, when Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to all Syrians fleeing the country's civil war. Germany has been targeted in a spate of recent attacks, including three carried out by asylum seekers, of which two were claimed by Isis. Several terror suspects posing as Syrian refugees have been arrested in German counter-terror operations so far this year, although no convictions have been announced. Harry Sarfo, a former Isis recruit, told The Independent he was approached by commanders looking for militants to carry out attacks in the UK and Germany while living in Raqqa last year. He said he declined and later fled the group, but there are fears it has continued to exploit the refugee route to send back trained jihadists. Europol estimates that up to 5,000 Europeans may have undergone training at terror camps abroad and the agency's director has warned the continent faces its ""biggest terror threat in more than a decade"" from returning fighters.

In November, just over half of respondents in a YouGov survey said they thought the number of asylum seekers in the country was too high but that figure now stands at 62 per cent. Protests by far-right anti-Islam groups Pegida and HoGeSa have swept the country this month, despite being met by equal numbers of anti-fascist counter demonstrators. Hundreds of right-wing protesters went on the rampage in Leipzig on Monday night, smashing windows and launching fireworks, while at least 11 refugees were attacked by a roving mob who had vowed to ""clean up"" Cologne the previous day. Read more  Germany sending hundreds of asylum seekers back to Austria every day   Vigilantes attack asylum seekers after vowing to 'clean up' Cologne   Cologne refugees living in fear of backlash   Angela Merkel says Europe is 'vulnerable' to the refugee crisis  The angry scenes are a far cry from the summer, when Angela Merkel lifted asylum restrictions for Syrian refugees - a decision that led to the arrival of 1.1 million migrants and asylum seekers last year and was credited in part for making the Chancellor  Time's Person of the Year . Her slogan - ""wir schaffen das"" - meaning ""we can do this"", has faded with a series of reversals by the Government, which has now reintroduced border controls and is sending hundreds of refugees back to Austria every day. ""Refugees welcome"", the summer's other defining slogan, is also heard less and less as attitudes harden following the police's announcement that migrants were largely responsible for the mass sexual assaults and robberies seen on New Year's Eve. Research by YouGov for Germany's  Bild  newspaper demonstrates the shift. In November, only a slim majority said the arrival figures were two high, while 42 per cent said they were acceptable and a fifth of respondents said the country could welcome more refugees. Now, almost two thirds of those surveyed say the number of asylum seekers is too high and only 16 per cent were comfortable with the figures. German women are more likely than men to oppose the current level of migration, which had not previously been the case, and the New Year's Eve sexual assaults are believed to be the main reason for a 12-point jump. Anti-sexual violence protesters have also been taking to the streets after police's response to the attacks and Cologne mayor Henriette Reker's controversial proposal of a ""code of conduct"" for women sparked a new debate about victim-blaming. At least 19 men are currently under investigation for attacks in the city, including 10 asylum seekers, most of whom arrived in Germany after September. In response to the alleged assault and robbery of at least 600 victims in Cologne, Ms Merkel has proposed new measures to deny the right of asylum for those who have committed crimes or are on probation in response to calls for change. Only asylum seekers who have been sentenced to at least three years' imprisonment and will not be at risk in their countries of origin can currently be forcibly deported under German law.

In September 2015 David Cameron pledged to take in 20,000 of the most vulnerable Syrian refugees by 2020, effectively pledging the UK to help 4,000 people each year. In a report released Tuesday morning, the spending and policy watchdog said the scheme had so far been a success and that early interim targets had been met by the Government. Read more The nation smaller than Yorkshire - that's taken in a million refugees But despite this the NAO warned that the programme would have to resettle more people each quarter than they had already done so far in order to meet the overall target to resettle 20,000 people by May 2020. The watchdog also said that the Government had made no estimate of the total cost of the programme, because spending was scattered between difference central government departments and participating local authorities. This could lead to resources becoming overstretched and bottlenecks forming in resettlement, Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, warned. ""The programme team achieved a great deal in a short amount of time, resettling much larger numbers of refugees than previous programmes, due in large part to the dedication and goodwill of those involved,"" he said. ""The characteristics of the refugees arriving in the UK will become clearer over time. With this new information, the programme team must adapt budgets so that no organisation taking part in the programme struggles to participate effectively due to cost pressures,"" Mr Morse added. The warning by the NAO comes just over a year after the scheme was set up by the former prime minister Mr Cameron - and a day after Archbishop of Canterbury warned the Government's response was ""too slow, too low and too narrow"". A report by the Home Affairs Select Committee released in July suggested that the MPs were ""concerned"" that the target might not be met. A year on from making the 20,000 pledge, the Home Office said it had given refuge to around 2,800 people - far fewer than the 4,000 a year needed to meet the commitment. In the fourth quarter of 2015 the UK accepted 1,085 - around the number required per quarter to hit the target. However, this rate of resettlement fell away quickly: in the first quarter of 2016 just 517 came to the UK. Before Mr Cameron's announcement an average of about 30 Syrian refugees per quarter were being taken in under the scheme - meaning there was a genuine increase. 2016 is set to be the deadliest year on record for Mediterranean Sea crossings to Europe by refugees, with aid workers on the ground warning there is no sign of the procession of people slowing.

Camera crews, photographers and journalists push and shuffle behind as the Prime Minister makes small talk through an interpreter. ""What could improve your life here,"" he asks. ""A swimming pool,"" replies one young boy. ""Grass to play on,"" answers another. ""What do you want to do when you grow up?"" ""Be a teacher,"" replies one. ""Well at least you don't want to be a pop star or a footballer,"" Mr Cameron quips. The class seems suspiciously small for a refugee camp of 80,000 - where over half are under 18. The ""teacher"" seems to speak suspiciously good English as she translates what the boys are saying to the Prime Minister. In fact she wasn't the real teacher at all - the real teacher came back after Mr Cameron had left. Welcome to refugee camp - and refugee crisis - by photo-opportunity. And a whistle stop one at that. Covering two countries (Lebanon and Jordan) in less than six hours each, Mr Cameron managed to cram in visits to three refugee families, a school, the Prime Minister in Lebanon, along with several stops in the region's largest refugee camp and a meeting with the King in Jordan. In between there were at least four changes of clothing - suit and tie for the diplomatic chat, then into dark chinos and short-sleeve shirts for the camps. Elias Bou Saab, Lebanon's Education Minister, claimed that Isis supporters could be among the refugees going to Europe. He had no hard evidence but said his ""gut feeling"" was that about 2 per cent could be ""radicals"", adding that Lebanese soldiers had been kidnapped by people masquerading as refugees in camps there. Read more: Grim reality faced by refugees stranded in LebanonThree stories from Syrians who have made a new life in the WestCameron: UK aid stops 'hundreds of thousands' reaching EU Every moment was meticulously choreographed - both for security reasons and for the message Mr Cameron wanted to project back home. It was a message hammered home in every media interview: Britain is ""pulling its weight"" by its international aid commitment - even if it is not prepared to share the burden of the European refugee crisis. To the aid sceptics there was a subtly different message: This money is being spent to stop more refugees coming to Britain and Europe - so aid spending is in the national interest. The refugee crisis - in pictures There was also a message to other European leaders: there was a ""moral imperative"" to help refugees not just in Europe but those closer to Syria. The UK spends 10 times more than France on such aid. ""Britain has spent a billion helping these refugees and now other countries need to follow our lead.""  This was not David Cameron's first trip to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. However, he was unlikely to recognise it. When he last visited it three years ago it was home to 23,000 Syrian refugees. Today it has more than tripled in size and accommodates 80,000 men, women and children - crammed into an area that covers just over one square mile. Mr Cameron announced that Britain would give another £6m to help Jordan cope with the refugee influx, out of a total extra £100m for the region. To put that figure in context: £6m is just £9.20 for each of the 629,000 Syrian refugees in the country. Jordan in contrast is predicted to have spent £2.7bn coping with the refugee crisis, compared to the £220m given in total by Britain in the same period.

""Syrian refugees in Jordan have entered a downward spiral in terms of their ability to sustain themselves,"" Andrew Harper, the UNHCR representative has said. ""We are concerned that this will deteriorate even further."" When Mr Cameron visited in 2012 he said he had been deeply affected by what he had seen. Asked how he felt three years on, he replied: ""It's very depressing the scale of the challenge we're facing. ""But it makes me think how right Britain was in supporting these camps and these refugees. This is not some recent thing we have discovered."" And he's right about that. Outside the gated part of the camp which contained the school room, a much larger group of children and teenagers hung around absorbing the strange scene.

We were still in denial: ""swarm"" territory. That column was the most shared and commented on I've ever written. As one might expect of i and independent.co.uk readers, there was some sympathy for the refugees. That said, watching Germans greeting Syrian refugees in Munich this weekend with sweets, water, teddy bears and applause, I puzzled again over the relatively unsympathetic British response. It was bemusing to be tagged ""a leftie"" just for expressing sympathy. Then it dawned on me: in the mix with racism (dark skins) and religious prejudice (Muslims) is a good, old-fashioned British obsession: class. READ MOREFive practical ways you can help refugees'Not angry about the refugee crisis? Here's a history lesson' One reason why some have chosen to view what are obviously refugees as ""merely"" economic migrants is that many don't conform to our stereotype of refugees. Regardless of the images of Homs, Aleppo or Kobane today - think post-blitz London, but worse - and despite the survivor stories, it appears being rescued from the sea or a dangerous march along a motorway aren't enough for some to accept their ""desperate"" status. This interpretation goes: they're not that desperate - because they are not in rags or obviously famished. But isn't that the point? The destruction of Syrian (or Iraqi) cities and Isis terror are indiscriminate. Muslims, Christians and Kurds are all dying or fleeing.

The announcements are in direct contrast with the Obama administration's promise to relocate 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016. President Barack Obama said on Monday that ""slamming the doors in [refugees] faces would be a betrayal of our values"" during a speech at the G20 summit in Turkey. ""The people who are fleeing Syria are the most harmed by terrorism. They are parents, they are children, they are orphans,"" he said. ""It is very important that we do not close our hearts to these victims of such violence and somehow start equating the issue of refugees with the issue of terrorism."" However, Republicans across the country were unmoved by the president's speech. And despiteobtaining absolutelyno constitutional power to refuse the resettlement of Syrian immigrants, the governors voiced their concerns. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey ""Given the horrifying events in Paris last week, I am calling for an immediate halt in the placement of any new refugees in Arizona. As governor, I am invoking our state's right under 8 USC, Section 1522 (a), to receive immediate consultation by federal authorities per the United States Refugee Act, and that the federal government take into account the concerns and recommendations of the state of Arizona as they are required to under federal law, in our efforts to keep our homeland safe. ""I also call on Congress and the President to immediately amend federal law to provide states greater oversight and authority in the administration of the placement of refugees. These acts serve as a reminder that the world remains at war with radical Islamic terrorists. Our national leaders must react with the urgency and leadership that every American expects to protect our citizens."" AlabamaGovernor Robert Bentley ""After full consideration of this weekend's attacks of terror on innocent citizens in Paris, I will oppose any attempt to relocate Syrian refugees to Alabama through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. As your Governor, I will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of Alabama in harm's way,"" Governor Bentley said in a statement. ""I will not place Alabamians at even the slightest, possible risk of an attack on our people."" ArkansasGovernor Asa Hutchinson ""As governor, I oppose any facility or installation in Arkansas being used as a Syrian refugee center. Many of the Syrian refugees are fleeing violence in their own country but Europe, Asia or Africa are logically the best places for resettlement or for temporary asylum. Syria is a war torn country and the United States will support our European friends in fighting ISIL in Syria and elsewhere; however, this is not the right strategy for the United States to become a permanent place of relocation. Again, I will oppose Arkansas being used as such a relocation center. The hardships facing these refugees and their families are beyond most of our understanding, and my thoughts and prayers are with them, but I will not support a policy that is not the best solution and that poses risk to Arkansans."" Florida Governor Rick Scott ""Please be aware that several organizations have requested that our state Department of Children and Families support the relocation of 425 possible Syrian refugees to Florida, as they receive federal funding to house those refugees in our state."" ""Following the terrorist attacks by ISIS in Paris that killed over 120 people and wounded more than 350, and the news that at least one of the terror attack suspects gained access to France by posing a Syrian refugee, our state agency will not support the requests we have received.""

North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory ""North Carolina has a proud tradition of providing a hand-up for those in need, including international refugees.However, because President Obama has increased the number of refugees from Syria coming into the United States from 2,000 to 10,000 and because of the terrorist attacks in Paris and the very real possibility that one of the terrorists entered France as a recent refugee, I am requesting that the federal government cease sending refugees from Syria to North Carolina,"" he wrote in a statement.

4372,src_theindependent_raw6.docx,The Independent,25/4/2015,1582 words,BOYD TONKIN,"War, famine, drought - the unholy trinity behind mass migration","For the last time: I agree with Nick. Earlier this week, the outgoing Deputy Prime Minister at last backtracked on his government's part in the withdrawal last year of EU search-and-rescue operations for migrants in the southern Mediterranean. Clegg argued that amid the proposals now aimed at stemming the flow, ""It's all too easy to forget that they are human beings"". At the core of this mass quest for refuge lies not just a human body - like the 1,200, beyond Titanic's toll, drowned over the past week alone - but a human mind. That mind registers hardship and peril at home, chooses among options, gathers assets, plans a route, weighs the risks, and sets off on a journey into hope. In the Mediterranean, we know how that journey has ended for 1,750 people already this year and about 3,300 last. However misguided, each of those shipwrecked (or, arguably, murdered) victims had taken a rational decision to flee conflict, penury or persecution - often enough, all three at once. Forget the bloodless reckoning of ""push factors"" against ""pull factors"". From Syria to Nigeria, Iraq to Eritrea, every one of those lost souls who chose to entrust their fate to a frail craft on the Libyan shore run by a scheming crook will have acted from a wholly individual blend of hope and fear, aspiration and desperation. Whichever course HMS Bulwark now plots (the Prime Minister promised the deployment of three naval vessels on Thursday), the people will still try to come. In 2014, 220,000 did make it across the Med to a mostly hostile Europe. The UK, for instance, has refused to match Germany and Sweden in offering some asylum places to Syrian refugees after a UN appeal for Europe to take in 130,000. And among the forces that conspire to uproot these ragged pilgrims lurk movements too profound for any fantasia of SAS strikes on smugglers' dens to eradicate. From Afghanistan to Nigeria, civil war, state breakdown and ethnic cleansing do wink on political radar screens. Further in the background, hard to isolate but even harder to mitigate, lies long-term climate change. In yesterday's Chatham House speech on foreign policy, instantly spun as an assault on David Cameron over post-conflict drift in Libya, Ed Miliband did in fact make the faintest of nods towards the deeper drivers of global turmoil. He said that ""what we have seen in Libya is that when tensions over power and resource began to emerge, they simply reinforced deep-seated ideological and ethnic fault lines in the country"". Those ""resource"" tensions will shake and scar an increasingly thirsty and crowded planet long after every current political career has closed. In bits and pieces, evidence for the links between political instability, mass migration and environmental crisis has mounted for more than a decade. In March, these once-speculative debates reached some front pages. A US study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences connected the unprecedented stretch of drought in Syria between 2006 and 2010 to rural depopulation, an upsurge of social and sectarian unrest in fast-expanding cities, and the outbreak of revolt against Bashar al-Assad. Correlation is not causation. In sites of upheaval, the roots of conflict may knit together beyond all disentanglement. All the same, as the co-author of the Syrian study Richard Seager phrased it: ""A drought made worse by climate change was one important factor that initiated the social unravelling."" In Iraq, according to meteorologist Eric Holthaus, the sudden ascent of Isis partnered record seasons of heat. Holthaus quotes Frank Femia of the Washington think-tank the Center for Climate and Security: ""You can't say climate change is causing Isis to do what it's doing, but it certainly has a role to play in the region."" In 2009, research found a correlation in sub-Saharan Africa between rising average temperatures and the likelihood of civil strife. To the US Defence Department, climate change ranks as a ""threat multiplier"". Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, commissioned an intelligence report that foresaw ""water wars"" breaking out from 2022 as aquifers dried, lakes and rivers parched and rains failed. In East Africa, a pact last month between Egypt and Ethiopia has for the moment silenced the mutual threats that arose from the latter's $5bn plan to harvest the Blue Nile via the - already half-built - ""Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam"". In 2012, Michael Werz of the Center for American Progress studied the role played by environmental stress in migration across north-west Africa. This week, writing for Reuters with Max Hoffman, he reiterated that ""climate and demographic trends can squeeze the margins of life at the family and community levels, contribute to decisions to migrate, heighten conflicts over basic resources and threaten state structures and regional stability"". At the southern end of trans-Saharan routes towards the sea and Europe, Nigeria - now scourged by the insurgency of Boko Haram - annually loses more than 1,350 square miles of land to desertification. Its population will double by 2040. Lake Chad - which sustains 25 million people - has lost 95 per cent of its volume since 1960. ""Nobody would argue that climate change is the only factor,"" warn Werz and Hoffman. However, ""the second-order effects of climate change - undermined agriculture and competition for water and food resources - can contribute to instability and to higher numbers of migrants"". The hunt for a single overarching cause behind the great shifts in history has a long and questionable pedigree. Neither lead poisoning nor homosexuality caused the downfall of the Roman Empire, as crackpots used to claim. Less fancifully, attendance at a Protestant church did not by itself transform northern Europeans into profit-hungry capitalists. Plausible pictures of seismic change take the form of clusters rather than chains. Yet a scientific weather eye, sharpened by new ways of decoding data, can now spot patterns in what contemporaries saw as discrete disasters. In his 2013 book Global Crisis, Yale historian Geoffrey Parker looks to the cooling of the ""Little Ice Age"", with its sodden summers, ruined harvests and deep-frozen winters, as a partial explanation for the catastrophic wars, famines and rebellions that convulsed the mid-17th century. This chill wind toppled thrones and smashed societies from India to Spain, China to Germany. So did Charles I lose his head in January 1649 because of climate change? Not exclusively, of course. Still, such a perspective may widen the ripples of our understanding. The problem with such a supersized interpretation is that it may leave us feeling even more helpless than before, paralysed into inertia by the daunting scale of forces now at work. At Durham University, David Held - master of University College and professor of politics and international relations - is a keynote speaker at a conference in June on human migration and the environment. Using the now-popular term for the epoch of man-made environmental change coined by chemist Paul Crutzen, it will ask: ""How should we conceive of migration in the Anthropocene?"" However, the advent of the ""Anthropocene"" alone has not shattered Syria, Iraq and Libya. A harsh critic of the ""9/11 wars"" and their chaotic aftermaths, Professor Held underlines that the wreckage left by botched Western interventions has done more than enough to leave Libya an anarchic mess where human smugglers flourish. The ousting of Gaddafi without any plan B has left ""a catastrophe that has destabilised the region from Mali to Tunisia"", he says. ""The breakdown of the Libyan state has created a pathway and provided an impetus for people to move in increasing numbers,"" Professor Held argues. At the same time, leaders in the intended destinations drag their feet and wring their hands. ""The EU is at its most fragile for the past 20 years. The 1990s model of Europe as the great soft power, against the hard power of the US, is much diminished."" Whatever combination of warfare, weather and dreams of betterment may drive them, survivors of the passage land in a weakened bloc. It responds to calamity late, or not at all. ""Solidarity,"" Professor Held notes, ""rarely grows under conditions of economic insecurity.""???The EU ""wants to present a cosmopolitan external face but at the same time, internally, it's a battleground for major states"". With those states' governments in thrall at home to right-wing isolationists, the EU has held out the prospect of a meagre 5,000 places for the most vulnerable refugees from ethnic cleansing and civil war. Too little, too late? It always is. Yet even tokens matter. If you wish to put a human face to the desperate quest for asylum, visit Liverpool Street station in London. There, on ""Hope Square"", stand the five bronze children of Frank Meisler and Arie Ovadia's statue The Arrival. They commemorate that Kindertransport that, from 1938 to 1940, brought 10,000 unaccompanied young refugees (including Meisler himself) out of peril in Hitler's Europe. As a gesture of humanity in another frightened time, it was not remotely enough, but it was not nothing. Contemplate these ageless kids - one with a teddy bear, another with a violin - and you see them gaze towards a future that despite all pain and loss feels ripe with possibility. Above all, read the lines from the Talmud inscribed beside the group: ""Whosoever rescues a single soul is credited as though they had saved the whole world.""",Broadsheet,0,2015-04,1,Conditions
3869,src_theindependent_raw5.docx,The Independent,3/9/2015,747 words,Holly Baxter,Why we've decided to call it Europe's refugee crisis; Rather than Europe's migrant problem,"Europe is seeing a crisis at the moment, but nobody can agree on what sort of crisis it is. If you believed some of the language used by British politicians - David Cameron's description of those arriving in Calais as a 'swarm', for instance, or Philip Hammond's characterisation of them as a group of people 'marauding around' who will threaten Europe's 'standard of living and social structure' if allowed to settle in the UK - then you might be forgiven for thinking that this is a crisis for Britain or Western Europe; that it's just an immigration problem which can be solved with more dogs and bigger, reinforced fences. According to commentators like Katie Hopkins, who infamously referred to those rescued from sinking boats in the Mediterranean as 'cockroaches', then the solution is little more than a large-scale exercise in pest control. The truth is that the crisis isn't ours at all. Those in crisis are not the citizens of Western European towns faced with the prospect of Syrian refugees moving in nearby. Those in crisis are the people so desperate to escape hardship, war, persecution and poverty that they have made a notoriously treacherous journey to Europe. The risks of this journey are myriad and real: in the last seven days alone, 71 refugees were found dead inside an abandoned lorry on the side of the road in Austria, and 50 were asphyxiated inside the hold of a boat off the coast of Libya. Thousands have drowned, suffocated, died of thirst or starved. In April, it was reported by the International Organisation for Migration that the death toll in the Mediterranean was already 30 times higher than it had been in 2014. In recognition of the fact that this is a humanitarian crisis of international proportions, rather than a British problem, the Independent will no longer be using the term 'migrant crisis' when 'refugee crisis' can be employed instead. In the last few months, semantics have become very important when addressing the plight of people crossing the ocean to seek a better life for themselves in Europe - and 'migrant' has become synonymous with 'problem' or 'member of the swarm'. The context of its usage, especially in politics, has allowed the word to be dehumanising. While its definition is supposedly neutral, meaning someone who leaves their home country for economic reasons, we now feel that it is sufficiently contentious to cease using it as a descriptive term for the entire crisis except when absolutely necessary. Refugees will be referred to as such, while those who do technically meet the definition of migrant will be merely referred to as 'people' where possible. However, there will be some instances when we choose to use the term 'migrant crisis'. In this way we hope to counteract the way in which 'migrant' or 'migrant crisis' is now being used by other media to scaremonger and to stir up hatred and suspicion toward desperate people. We are proud of the way that we have chosen to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Europe and the plight of these refugees. In articles such as 'It's time to stop the politics of fear and treat these people like human beings', 'No, Philip Hammond, migrants don't threaten our standard of living - your policies do', 'Don't call Calais a migrant problem: it's a humanitarian crisis', and 'In treating needy refugees like invaders, we risk losing our humanity', we have continually emphasised the need for the British government to show their compassion and responsibility towards people who have fled impossible and unbearable situations. We will continue to give a platform to those who write with empathy and humanity about refugees across the continent, and we hope that by rejecting the use of 'migrant' as a catch-all description in our articles we can also preserve the dignity of people who have been continually attacked, dehumanised and insulted in the UK press and UK politics.  We're urging people to:   ● Show your friends you support the UK taking in its fair share of refugees by signing a petition urging the Government to take action at change.org/refugeeswelcome   ● Join our social media campaign - #refugeeswelcome - to prove that those in real need of a safe haven will receive a compassionate welcome from many of us here   ● Share this link so your friends know to do the same  The refugee crisis - in pictures",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,1,Conditions

But in the case of the Young Vic, there is real substance to the assertion. The venue proves this not just in its celebrated international co-productions but in its hospitality to visits by foreign companies and by the depth of its engagement with local communities and young people. A few weeks ago, the theatre joined forces with Developing Artists and Refuge Productions to bring across Queens of Syria, an exceptionally moving piece in which a group of real-life Syrian refugees (none of them actors) brought Euripides' tragedy The Trojan Women up-to-date with their own unforgettable personal testimonies of exile and loss.  The piece was a salutary rebuke to those who have become numbed to the migration crisis or who categorise asylum-seekers as some faceless, threatening mass. Individual narratives are again powerfully emphasised in Now We Are Here which has been created by refugee writers in workshops with Deanna Rodger, Imogen Brodie and Ian Rickson. The latter directs the sensitive, compelling production which strips away everything but the bare minimum needed for these voices to be heard.  In the first half we listen to the overlapping verbatim testimony of Desmond Jolly, Mir Ahmed and MichaelMugishangyezi (beautifully played by Gary Beadle, Manish Gandhi and Jonathan Livingstone). Two have fled the homophobic abuse in their native countries of Jamaica and Pakistan (such as incarceration in a mental asylum for refusing to get married), while the third has been in prison in East Africa because of ""political and tribal tensions"". The second half consists of Tamara McFarlane's lyrical monologue (superbly performed by Golda Rosheuvel) that looks back at her fifteen year old self in Jamaica and recounts how religious intolerance and fear blighted her blossoming sexual love for a fellow schoolgirl. What do you reply when someone asks you ""How was your day?"" when you've had to kill the hours before the hostel reopens without any semblance of a routine or even enough for a bus fare in your pocket? It's a question that stumps Michael, who has no ID card either, and he vividly communicates the unending sense of futility of ""people who are at the sea level of their own hopes. You mourn your own life"". But the testimonies are flecked with humour too - stories about escapades back home, say, such as the one that left young Mir and his friend with twenty floors of uninterrupted secret kissing-time in a yo-yoing lift.  Tamara witnesses the horrific murder of a 14 year old gay youth by a bigoted mob. In her fear that she will bring a similar retribution down on her loved ones, she makes protective moves that have a piercingly sad outcome. It's as if the stench of burning tyre enters your own nostrils as you listen to Rosheuevel's extraordinarily immediate account of the boy's fate. The frankness with which all the participants have shared their stories is a tribute both to their courage and to the atmosphere of trust that must have been created in the workshops. All the performances of Now We Are Here are being given for free (donations welcome to three charities working with refugees that have been chosen by the collaborators). Well worth catching.

In Germany this will cost $30,000","Five years after the start of the conflict in Syria, world leaders are still trying to work out how they can heave the country out of the abyss. But one thing is certain: the British aid effort has been severely let down by our European partners. Since 2012, donor governments and aid organisations have spent around $15 billion on looking after ever increasing numbers of Syrian refugees. About 10 per cent of that has been contributed by the UK. Overall, Britain is by far the biggest European donor to Syrian refugees in the Middle East. Countries like Germany and France did not pull their weight in the early days of the Syrian refugee crisis. Unlike the UK, they failed to spend enough money on families who had stayed in the region after fleeing the horror of the civil war. Read more Trump and Trudeaumania are changing American views of Canada The result? Hundreds of thousands of refugees decided to risk everything by making the journey to Europe. Caring for the basic needs of a refugee in Europe costs at least ten times as much as in countries neighbouring Syria. Whereas a budget of $3,000 per refugee in Jordan would provide not just basic food and water but also education and opportunity, this will cost over $30,000 per refugee in Germany or Austria. European countries will now pay more in the long run, so how did this situation come about? Due to the scale of the crisis, that $15 billion never amounted to more than $2,000 per refugee per year - not much of a budget to support people who were barred from earning money themselves in their countries of refuge. A second failure was that the aid effort never moved beyond a 'first 100 days' emergency response. Even though it was clear in 2013 that there would be no rapid return to Syria, refugees were still unable to work in Jordan, Turkey or Lebanon, and Western donor governments did little to encourage a change of policy.

Mr Cameron made the policy U-turn following mounting political pressure - including from Tory backbenchers. The move came after Lord Dubs, who came to Britain on the Kindertransport programme for Jewish children escaping the Nazis, tabled an amendment to a Bill which would have forced the Government to accept 3,000 child refugees.

He said: ""Now that the referendum is over it is time they got on with it. ""No one has come through on this scheme yet.

Humanitarian aid groups have warned that the deal will be impossible for overwhelmed Greek and EU officials to implement.While atop UN official has said that the deal to send Syrian refugees back to Turkey en masse could be illegal, as Ankara is pushing them back over the border into the war zone. ""Collective deportations without having regard to the individual rights of those who claim to be refugees are illegal,"" Peter Sutherland, the UN Secretary General's special representative for international migration and development told the BBC.

""We definitely don't want a refugee camp in Dikili,"" said the town's mayor, Mustafa Tosun, according to the Associated Press.Demonstrators expressed concern over the impact the EU deal could have on the economy, tourism and security in their town. Greece is scrambling to prepare returning the first refugees from Syria and other war torn regions back to Turkey under the terms of the deal struck on 18 March at a Turkey-EU summit in Brussels. The agreement is aimed at deterring them from using people smugglers to cross from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, a route which one million refugees have taken over the past year. Under the accord, EU countries pledged to take one screened refugee directly from Turkish soil for each Syrian refugee returned to Turkey. Human rights group Amnesty International also believe the deal will have an adverse effect on the safety of migrants and refugees. ""In their desperation to seal their borders, EU leaders have wilfully ignored the simplest of facts: Turkey is not a safe country for Syrian refugees,"" John Dalhuisen, Amnesty's Europe and central Asia director said. Officials are already warning that the deal face delays as they try to manage the readmission processes and build a new infrastructure for returns almost from scratch. The ongoing stream of refugees continuing to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece means that there is already a huge backlog to handle. The United Nations refugee agency has said it will no longer provide assistance at the detention centers in line with its policy against mandatory detention of asylum seekers. Greek officials say they need a 20-fold increase in personnel to handle the expected claims. They also have to decide how to handle more than 50,000 refugees stranded in the country, unable to move northwards as Greece's neighbours have closed their borders. Nor has the EU's deal with Turkey had an effect on refugee flows: an estimated 5,000 refugees have landed on the Greek islands since the summit agreement last month. However, unrest has already spread among refugees in anticipation of the returns, with clashes breaking out between police and asylum seekers at Idomeni refugee camp, where over 11,000 people have been stranded since Balkan countries shut down their borders in late February. In Idomeni on Saturdaymore than 200 refugees and migrants staged a protest on roadlinking Greece and Macedonia, demanding that Macedonia open its borders.

Demonstrators were working their way from Park Lane to Parliament Square in London yesterday afternoon, demanding action as a crucial United Nations summit on the crisis approaches. Marchers chanted ""refugees are welcome here"" while waving banners reading ""no-one is illegal"" and ""let's help people"". Amnesty International said actors Juliet Stevenson, Vanessa Redgrave and George MacKay as well as the Kaiser Chiefs's Simon Rix would be among demonstrators. Lord Alf Dubs, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Baroness Sheehan were also due to address a rally in Parliament Square. Brendan Cox, the husband of killed Labour MP Jo Cox, said she had planned to join the protest before her death in June. Writing on Twitter, he said he and their children Cuillin and Lejla ""marched in her stead today imagining her by our side"". It comes a year after around 100,000 protesters took to London's streets calling on the UK to resettle more asylum seekers amid the international outcry over the death of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned trying to reach Greece. The Solidarity With Refugees group said yesterday's protest aimed to ""show our Government and the world that Britain is ready to welcome more refugees"". ""The UK should be leading the way and working with other states to give refugees safe, legal routes to asylum, ending the trade in people smuggling,"" a spokesperson said. ""Since the referendum campaign and vote, divisive rhetoric has been ever more prevalent from a small but vocal minority. In the light of this, the need to come together in a spirit of welcome has become even more acute."" The march was supported by charities and groups including the Red Cross, Asylum Aid, Save the Children, Hope Not Hate, Oxfam and the UN Refugee Agency. Kate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK, described the Government's contribution to tackling the refugee crisis as ""shocking"" but praised local communities and volunteers for ""taking matters into their own hands"" to support migrants. ""This march is to show that ordinary people in Britain actually care deeply about refugees,"" she said. ""Many of those seeking sanctuary have seen their families torn apart and homes destroyed. As one of the richest countries in the world, our government can and must do more to help."" Mr Rix, the Kaiser Chiefs's bassist, described the refugee crisis as a ""global disaster"" while Ms Stevenson called on world leaders to share responsibility, adding: ""I hope Theresa May is listening."" The show of solidarity comes as world leaders prepare for the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. A UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants on Monday will be followed by a separate summit on the issue hosted by Barack Obama the following day. More than 3,200 refugees and asylum seekers have drowned attempting to reach Europe so far this year, with almost 300,000 completing the journey. But thousands remain trapped in Greece after being automatically detained under the controversial EU-Turkey deal, under threat of deportation if their asylum applications fail. Those granted protection face an increasingly difficult task reaching other parts of Europe as countries increase border controls and build fences to stop the flow of migrants. Oxfam has warned that millions of refugees are being forced to flee from one warzone into another, while a report released this week found that attempted crackdowns in Europe were failing to significantly reduce refugee numbers and instead forcing migrants on hidden and dangerous routes. In the wake of Alan's death, David Cameron pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK over the coming five years but there have been additional calls to re-home those who have already reached Europe, as well as asylum seekers coming from other conflict zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

""But it costs $5,000 and I don't have that money. If I had it, yes, even if I might die in the sea I would go - life here is too hard."" Ms Sayyed, 24, is just one of more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees being hosted by Lebanon, a tiny country that had a population of four million before civil war broke out in neighbouring Syria. Her story is typical. A year or so ago, her husband went missing in their hometown of Ghouta - the Damascus suburb hit by a chemical weapons attack believed to be the work of the Assad government. Fearing for her life, she fled to Lebanon with her five children and now lives in poverty in an informal camp in the Chouf Mountains. The refugee crisis - in pictures ""I want to educate my kids, I want to feed them,"" she says as she waits in line for food kits from the UK charity, Islamic Relief. ""None of them are able to go to a formal school here, and the food aid gets smaller every day. Nothing is easy."" Lebanon has been overwhelmed by its refugee crisis. The government has refused to set up formal camps like those in Turkey and Jordan, which provide refugees with plumbing, drinkable water, weather-proof shelters and regular electricity. Instead, refugees like Ms Sayyed are spread out across the country, mostly in poor, rural neighbourhoods and have to depend on handouts from a variety of aid organisations, which can be sporadic and insufficient. The World Food Programme announced this summer that funding shortfalls had forced it to cut the value of its food vouchers for Syrian refugees in Lebanon in half, to just £9 a month.

Just 30 per cent of Syrian refugee children in Lebanon are able to go to school. The hope for a better life - particularly for one's children - is the driving factor behind a refugee crisis that much of the Middle East has been shouldering for years, and that has now begun to wash up on the shores of Europe. In Europe, there are fears of a potentially overwhelming influx. Denmark has placed ads in several Lebanese newspapers warning potential asylum-seekers of new restrictions. But the reality is that less than 10 per cent of the 4.5 million Syrians who have escaped the four-year conflict have sought safety in Europe, according to the UNHCR. More than 50 per cent are in Turkey.

She is one of roughly 2,000 people sleeping rough outside the station. Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and people from many other nations are seeking refuge in Europe. Amira, who fled from Qamishli in northern Syria, has been in Hungary for 11 days. Like many others, her ultimate goal is Germany. She sleeps on a piece of cardboard, with a pack of nappies as a pillow. Her son Fawaz, four months old, coughs. Like many here, she tried to board the train to Austria this week. It was the first train in days to take on refugees. She says she is happy she did not manage to push through the crowd. That train did not travel to Austria, but to a registration centre in Bicske, a town 45 minutes away. Almost 500 of its tired but determined passengers refused to leave the train until last night, when a stand-off with riot police ended peacefully. ""A Hungarian woman warned it would take us to camps, and not to Germany,"" Amira explains. Hundreds of other migrants broke out from one such camp in Roszke yesterday. The refugees and migrants in Keleti station have also been defying police, refusing to leave the station and insisting that they can keep going west. International trains remain suspended for ""safety reasons"", the departure board says. Police direct lost tourists to local trains but bar the refugees from the platform area. Frustrated by the lack of action, hundreds of migrants set off for Austria on foot yesterday, aiming to reach Germany. Amira's time in Hungary has shaken her belief in Europeans. ""We don't trust them: they will take us to the camps and beat us,"" she says. ""I hope that when the train comes it will take us away from here; that is all that I want."" Amira crossed four borders to get to Budapest during a harrowing journey that is becoming a rite of passage for thousands seeking a better life in Europe. Some 200,000 people have crossed the sea between Turkey and Greece, paying hundreds of pounds to smugglers for a space on overcrowded dinghies. ""It's the worst thing I have ever done in my life,"" says Mountaha, 23, who fled from Idlib in Syria. She and her husband, Anas, 24, a computer engineer, initially fled to Turkey. But after six months there they decided they wanted a better future for their son Mohamed, who is two months old. They paid Euro 5,000 (£3,669) to a smuggler, having sold their car and gold in Syria to finance the trip. There were 60 people packed into a boat meant for half that number. ""You can't imagine: women screaming, children crying..."" she says as her voice trails off. Having reached Europe, they took a bus on Sunday from Thessaloniki to the tiny town of Idomeni, the last Greek town before the border with Macedonia. Mountaha wore trainers, ready for the walk over the train tracks to cross the border. The railway to Belgrade has turned into a flashpoint for unofficial border crossings. Every day roughly 2,000 people cross it into Macedonia from Idomeni. Greek police help people make the illegal crossing, sorting them into groups of 50 before allowing them to cross. Every 30 minutes or so a train rattles by and people scurry from the tracks. There are refugees everywhere, trying to find some shade from the blazing sun underneath the trees or a parked train carriage. Once in Macedonia, £8 buys a ticket from Gevgelija to the last train station before the Serbian border. On the train, the diversity of the refugees becomes clear. There is Naomie, 17, immaculately made up with black eyeliner, mascara and pink lipstick and smiling from under the wide rim of her hat. ""I'm going to Hamburg - we have family there. I dream of becoming a doctor,"" she says. She is travelling with her cousin Hanin; both are from Aleppo. They used to live a comfortable life. Hanin left behind her house with a swimming pool and large garden, and her dog. Her husband has stayed behind. ""I'm embarrassed to travel this way,"" she says gesturing around at the carriage, where children and men have stretched out in the aisles to sleep. Outside this train, they take taxis and sleep in hotels; like many Syrian refugees they belong to the middle class. On the other of the spectrum is Imad, a low-level government employee from Douma, a suburb of Damascus. He has spent almost all his money on the trip across the sea and is now relying on charity. ""I only have Euro 300 (£220) left for the rest of the journey,"" he says. ""I'm counting on people being generous."" And they are. He holds up a sandwich someone gave him in Macedonia. He, too, is heading for Germany but he has no idea where. ""Do you think my three daughters can join me there?"" he asks. Once they reach the border, there is no time to waste. Those streaming out of the train are joined by more people getting off buses. The lines of migrants stretch out into the fields as far as the eye can see, past the border into Serbia. The vast majority of those on the Balkan route are Syrians. Iraqis, Pakistanis and Afghans make up the next biggest groups. Those speaking perfect English have given up on the idea of going to Britain - it is too difficult. ""We are heading to Belgium,"" say some teachers in their late twenties before hurrying off across the border. In Serbia, all migrants and refugees must register. But the registration centre in Presovo, a town two miles from the last Macedonian train station, is overwhelmed by the thousands trying to do so. They wait in tents outside the gates of the converted tobacco factory. Those who make it past the police barrier are searched, registered, fingerprinted and photographed. They then receive a 72-hour pass, in Serbian, with the name of an asylum centre, which nobody will go to. More important, the document allows them to use public transport and book into hotels. Bus companies employ fixers speaking Arabic to hustle for business. Paper in hand, people move on to Belgrade. Yann, a pharmacist from Kobane in Syria is travelling with a group of young men from the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. Belgrade is a stopover where people plan how to tackle the next border and the entry point of the borderless Schengen zone: Hungary. The Macedonian and Serbian borders are easily crossed, but Hungary is trying to stop refugees entering. A barbed wire fence was recently completed. ""Everything, every hour, everything changes,"" Yann says. Smugglers hand out pieces of paper with phone numbers - Euro 500 (£367) gets you to Hungary, Euro 1,500 (£1,100) to Germany. ""I can't afford it,"" Yann sighs. Buses take those looking to cross into Hungary up to Horgos, on the Serbian-Hungarian border. From there, they will continue on foot. A trail of trash and beaten down bushes shows what used to be a popular route, through the forest between two rivers. Now three spools of razor wire stretch out along the trees. Border police patrol, using search lights at night. But people still get through. Mohammed, 17, from Damascus managed to wiggle through after his companions cut the wire. But he was stopped by Hungarian police and spent five days in a registration camp. ""It was disgusting and we only got one litre of water a day,"" he says. Like many waiting at Keleti station he has been registered as EU law requires. ""I want to go to Germany. Why won't they let us leave?""

The leaders of every political party apart from Ukip urged the Prime Minister to reverse his hard-line stance and let the UK accept its ""fair share"" of refugees. Meanwhile, a grassroots campaign has sprung up to organise protests and petitions calling on ministers to accept Britain's obligation to tackle the largest exodus of people since the Second World War. Mr Cameron is also facing diplomatic pressure to change his stance. Yesterday, the German ambassador to the UK, Peter Ammon, was authorised to make a rare public intervention calling for Britain to do more. ""Britain has taken in refugees for centuries,"" said Mr Ammon. ""With the humanitarian tradition that you have, we should be able to find a solution here."" Yvette Cooper led the calls from all the Labour leadership candidates for Mr Cameron to alter his position. ""When mothers are desperately trying to stop their babies from drowning when their boat has capsized, when people are being left to suffocate in the backs of lorries by evil gangs of traffickers and when children's bodies are being washed to shore, Britain needs to act,"" she said. ""It is heartbreaking. We cannot keep turning our backs on this."" The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: ""Enough is enough. These pictures are beyond horrific. They are the wake-up call David Cameron needs. There is a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep, but the Government appears disengaged, cold and irrelevant. We must take our fair share of refugees."" The Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: ""I think most people want to see the UK play its part in a humanitarian response. Scotland will play a full part."" Her comments were backed by Leanne Wood, the leader of Plaid Cymru in Wales, and the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who said: ""The heart-wrenching scenes we're seeing - of children being washed up dead on beaches, of people being detained en masse on trains, of thousands upon thousands risking their lives to come to Europe - serve as a reminder of our duty to help those in peril. Britain can and must do more - it's time for the Government to wake up to the cruelty of its stance and give many more refugees the chance to settle here."" They were responding to comments earlier in the day by Mr Cameron, who reiterated his position that the UK was already doing enough. ""I don't think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees,"" he said. But his remarks led to a backlash on social media, with thousands of people signing petitions condemning the Government's stance. Avaaz, a global activist organisation, teamed up with the charity Citizens UK to call for a ""safe haven for Syrian refugees"". So far, more than 1,300 people have pledged to volunteer to help integrate refugees into the British community, many offering accommodation in their own homes. A petition calling for the Government to provide medical care to migrants in Calais was nearing its goal of 75,000 signatures last night, while demonstrations are planned in central London, Dover and Oxford at the weekend. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, said he had received numerous letters from the public telling him it was a ""disgrace"" that the UK was letting people die. He told ITV News that Britons would not stand for the fact that they were ""seeing dead bodies on the beaches"". He added: ""It's no longer an abstract problem of people who are on the scrounge, it's not??? What is screaming out is the human tragedy of this problem."" The Independent launched its own petition last night calling for Britain to ""accept its fair share of refugees"". Politicians also posed with placards stating: ""Refugees welcome.""

The men, both Syrian nationals, face up to 35 years in prison if they are found guilty on charges of human trafficking and manslaughter.

The two men, Muwafaka Alabash and Asem Alfrhad, opened in the Aegean seaside town of Bodrum on Thursday. They are accused of causing the deaths of five people, including Aylan, ""through deliberate negligence"". Aylan and his family had fled the northern Syrian town of Kobani, which wasperiodically besieged by Isis militants throughout 2014 and 2015. After a period living in Turkeywith the hope of returning to their hometown, the family made two failed attempts to travel through Europe to Canada, where Aylan's aunt Tima Kurdi lived in Vancouver. The crossing which killed all of the family except the father,Abdullah Kurdi, was their third attempt. Abdullah has described how the family paid a combined (EURO)4,000 (£2,900) to people smugglers for places on a small dinghy. They began the crossing at night - but when the sea became too rough for the small vessel, the people smugglers allegedly abandoned it, leaving the passengers to try and steer it on their own. The boat soon capsized, throwing the refugees into the sea. ""I was holding my wife's hand,"" Mr Kurdi has said. ""My children slipped away from my hands.We tried to hold on to the boat. Everyone was screaming in pitch darkness."" When the images of Aylan first began circulating on social media on 2 September last year, The Independent took the editorialdecision to publish the most shocking versions in full.

Sorry to break this to you, but you're an idiot; You don't need to be a white westerner to own a relatively cheap piece of technology","""Hey, those people fleeing war in Syria aren't poor at all! Look, they all have smartphones!"" is one increasingly tedious complaint that has been bubbling away on social media recently. Owning a mobile phone, it seems, should render one ineligible for help when trying to stop yourself and your family from dying in a war. On the surface this may look like xenophobia searching for something to grab on to following a shift in the public mood towards refugees from the Middle East. But it is actually a fairly progressive stance: just weeks ago the anti-immigration brigade were complaining that migrants are unskilled and just want our benefits. And now they're arguing that migrants are too wealthy instead, implicitly arguing we should prioritise helping the poor. But in any case, it does raise an interesting question: Exactly how surprised should we be that people from Syria carry smartphones? READ MOREGerman industry calls for new arrivals to be given the right to workGermany's welcoming approach towards people in need is no surprise Syria is not a rich country, but it is not a poor country either: it ranks as a ""lower middle income"" according to the World Bank. In 2007 (the last year stats for both were available) Syria had a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $1850 which is more than Egypt at the time, which was only at $1620. Mobile phone penetration is similarly high in Syria as Egypt too. According to the CIA World Factbook in 2014 Syria had 87 mobile phones per 100 of the population, compared to Egypt's 110 per 100 (the UK has 123 per 100 people). Refugees march from Hungary to Austria In 2011 we saw Egyptians take to the streets and using the power of their smartphones to mobilise support across apps and social media. Which raises another question: why can we accept that Egypt can have phones ubiquitous enough to ferment a revolution, yet act surprised when a wealthier country not too far away isn't in a similar situation? So we know that Syria isn't dirt poor and we know that there's a lot of mobile phones: but why smartphones? Well, why not? In the West many people own desktop computers, laptops and tablets as well as smartphones. But if you had to give up many of your possessions and live on $1,850 a year, after clothes and food, what would you buy next? It is hard to think of a more useful thing to own than a smartphone, especially if you're fleeing your home. Even when utility isn't considered, the reason Syrians are using smartphones and not old Nokia 3210s is the same reason that benefits claimants have (gasp!) ""flatscreen"" TVs... have you tried buying any other kind lately? Budget Android smartphones can be picked up for well under £100, and come with cameras, large screens and everything you would expect from a modern phone. As we're now in the habit of replacing our phones with a new model every year or two the price of slightly older phones also drops significantly. It's also possible to pick up the second generation iPhone - the iPhone 3G - for around £25, and despite being a few years old is still perfectly serviceable. There are more mobile phones than people in the world so chances are that anyone who can afford a phone (like millions of Syrians) already own one. So the answer to how surprised should we be that many of the Syrian refugees have smartphones is a resounding ""not very"". The world isn't a binary split between ""rich"" and ""poor"" - and we should adjust our assumptions about the countries in the middle accordingly.

In the first nine months of 2014, there were 2,118 detentions, while in 2015 the figure had increased to 4,785. In the three months to the end of September alone, there had been 2,781 detentions.

David Cameron refers to Calais as 'bunch of migrants' Throughout the summer migrants massed in Calais made thousands of attempts to reach Britain, with a number dying as they tried to make the journey. The crisis was said to have cost the economy millions of pounds as hauliers were forced to dispose of contaminated goods and wait in lengthy queues on the M20 in Kent. HMIP described the response to high numbers of migrants arriving through the Channel Tunnel as ""inadequate"", saying the basic physical needs of detainees were not met and conditions lacked decency. Their report said the Dover Seaport facility was ""crowded, poorly ventilated and smelled badly"". A child stands among razor-wire fencing on the Greek-Macedonian border near the Greek village of Idomeni (AFP) It was not designed to hold people for more than a few hours but over the summer detainees were held for an average of 18 hours.

""If we have this, everything will be beautiful,"" noted 10-year-old Ryiad. ""I also hope to make good friends and wish we could have toys and a garden to play in with my little brother."" Today marks the end of Refugee Week, which is about celebrating the aspirations and hopes of refugees like Ryiad. It is about remembering that despite the different circumstances or places where we come from, our dreams and hopes for a better future unite us. Across the world, more than 22 million refugees are fleeing from war, conflict, natural disasters, persecution, and intolerance, which are the principal drivers of these forced movements. Such circumstances understandably lead people to make the decision to leave home in search of safety. Many of these refugees have been stuck in protracted periods of displacement, and are struggling for a chance to start a new life. Yet not everybody is knocking on Europe's door. Ten countries host more than half of the world's refugees, and nine of the top ten refugee-hosting countries are in developing regions. Every sixth individual in Lebanon is a refugee. These countries continue to shoulder a disproportionate share of the responsibility for hosting refugees and wealthier countries like the UK can and should do more. In recent weeks, the overwhelming generosity of the British public has been showcased in response to a series of unfolding tragedies. In these dark moments, the British people have poured onto the streets to help those in need, demonstrating remarkable acts of bravery and kindness. The public's spirit of solidarity in the face of suffering is heartening and reminds us of our common humanity. Reflecting on her future hopes when she moves to the UK, six year old Asmaa from Syria tells us: ""I hope to make lots of good friends. It is very important to have good friends in life."" Asmaa, like us, takes solace in her community to overcome times of hardship. She too is hopeful for a brighter future. As we mark the end of this year's Refugee Week, we should reflect on the power of community to help us through periods of adversity. Our ability and willingness to empathise with others and to recognise our shared hopes for the future can help bring us closer together.

In a written ministerial statement published on Wednesday, the Home Secretary said that while the decision to grant Humanitarian Protection rather than Refugee Leave to Syrians fleeing war was ""right at the time"", the Government has since recognised that it did not provide access to particular benefits and decided to grant them refugee status. ""At the beginning of the scheme, granting Humanitarian Protection allowed us to quickly assist and resettle the most vulnerable.

""We have listened to those who have raised concerns about the consequences, for those we resettle to the UK, of granting Humanitarian Protection rather than Refugee Leave. We have also taken the time to work through the policy and practical implementation issues in detail. ""The decision to grant Humanitarian Protection was the right one at that time. However, while Humanitarian Protection recognises the need an individual has for international protection, it does not carry the same entitlements as refugee status, in particular, access to particular benefits. ""We think it is right to change the policy and now is the right time to make this change."" The statement said that from 1 July 2017, the Government would be granting those admitted under the VPRS and the VCRS refugee status and five years' limited leave, with those who are already resettled under these programmes given the opportunity to make a request to change their status from Humanitarian Protection to refugee status.

David Cameron said he welcomed the plans to send migrants back to Turkey, as it would foil people smugglers. He added that because Britain is not in Europe's passport-free Schengen area, it will not offer visa-free travel to Turks. ""We maintain our own immigration policy,"" he said.

The aim is ""to break the business model of the people smugglers"" and offer refugees an alternative to risking their lives. The one-for-one plan is a ""temporary and extraordinary measure"", to be capped at 72,000 migrants. At the same time, the EU would double an agreed (EURO)3bn fund to help refugees in Turkey and would hasten visa-free travel for Turks in Europe.

The United Nations said that since the last EU-Turkey summit on 7 March, almost 11,000 people have reached Greece, bringing the total on that route to 144,000 so far this year; at least 96 have died trying. Q&A:The Turkey deal European leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron, are meeting in Brussels to thrash out a refugee swap with Turkey. The deal is fraught with potential pitfalls, with critics lambasting it as immoral, illegal and unworkable. Even European Council President Donald Tusk - who hosts the summit - admitted gloomily ""the catalogue of issues to be resolved is long"". Here are some of the questions that could derail the deal: Q.Is sending refugees back to Turkey illegal? A.  European Union countries are bound by the United Nations 1951 Convention on Refugees, which says all applications have to be properly reviewed, and asylum seekers cannot be returned to a country that does not offer proper protection. This is reiterated in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also bans collective expulsions. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel García-Margallo says the blanket return of refugees to Turkey is ""illegal under international law"". Q. Can Turkey be considered a 'safe' country? A. Only Europeans are currently guaranteed refugee status in Turkey: the EU's own rules say this does not meet its criteria as a ""safe"" third country for refugees. While Turkey currently hosts around 2.5 million Syrian refugees, human rights groups say Syrians are often sent back over the border into the war zone. While EU officials say Turkey will offer proper protection to all applicants, there is little evidence that Ankara will actually do it. Q.Why are the Cypriots blocking the deal? A. Cyprus President Nikos Anastasiades has pledged to veto the opening of five new ""chapters"" in Ankara's EU membership negotiations unless Turkey recognises the island as a single country. Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, and the island is still partitioned. Today, Turkey is the only country in the world to officially recognise Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state. This is especially sensitive for Cyprus, which is currently engaged in sensitive reunification talks with Northern Cyprus. Q.What is in it for the Turks? A. Turkey wants the EU to grant full visa-free travel for its citizens by the end of June. There is already resistance from EU leaders, wary of headlines suggesting 75 million Turks can visit any time. ""There cannot be any concessions on the matter of human rights or the criteria for visa liberalization"" French President François Hollande said. There are also technical demands: Turkey has to meet 72 benchmarks for visa-free access. It currently meets 35. Q.How long can Greece be expected to cope? A. European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans says all asylum seekers on Greek islands will get proper hearings, but that assumes Greece's asylum system is upgraded to cope with thousands of arrivals a week - an questionable scenario. Athens might need hundreds more judges and translators to process the applications. Greece also faces the challenge of removing 8,000 people from the islands in a matter of days. Q.What if resettlement fails? A. Last year, the EU agreed to resettle only 22,000 Syrian refugees over two years, a figure the UN called ""very low"" given that 4.8 million Syrians have fled their homes. Even so, only about 3,400 people have been found homes in 10 European countries. ""The swap model with Turkey is a non-scalable fantasy,"" says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""It defies belief that EU member states will be more willing to accept refugees directly from Turkey.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-03,0,Policy

After a a public outcry that saw more than 250,000 people backing The Independent's campaign for action, the Prime Minister said more information about the expanded resettlement scheme would be set out next week. A UN refugee agency spokeswoman suggested Britain would take in 4,000 people fleeing war-torn Syria, although Downing Street has refused to confirm the number or whether a figure has even been decided. And for millions of Syrians who have fled their country's civil war, time is not on their side. How many is ""thousands""? Where will they be located? Does he regret describing refugees as a ""swarm""? Will he support a pan-European effort to spread the burden of refugees away from Greece, Italy and Hungary? These are the four key questions we still need answers to.  1. How many?  Mr Cameron promises ""thousands more"" Syrian refugees will be given sanctuary in Britain, expanding the UK's current resettlement scheme that has granted just 216 places since it was set up last year. Anything less than 10,000 will be seen as a disappointment from the chorus of political leaders in the UK, a growing number of Tory MPs and even his own ministers. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary and Labour leadership candidate, has called for a figure of around 10,000. Falling short of this figure would be a dereliction of duty in the view of the United Nations, whose commissioner for refugees Antonio Guterres has told EU leaders that ""no country can refuse to do its part"" in his plan to relocate 200,000 refugees. Meanwhile, it would undermine Britain's relations with its neighbours, with Germany having admitted more than 35,000 refugees over the past year alone, with an estimated 800,000 expected to be given refuge by the end of the year. The Green party's demand that the UK accept 240,000 refugees may sound very ambitious, but it would still only account for a third of Germany's intake this year.  2. Where?  No details whatsoever have been mentioned by Downing Street as to where the ""thousands"" of Syrian refugees will be housed. Will these vulnerable people, who have lived through four years of war, be given access to the essential services they will be very much in need of? Ms Cooper made a speech earlier this week setting out a detailed proposal for the UK to accept 10,000 refugees by housing 10 families in each London borough. She is holding a meeting of local authorities, faith groups and voluntary organisations from across the country next week to work out what help they can provide. Co-ordinated Government action along these lines would go a long way to finding the places and safety that so many Syrians need.

Does the Prime Minister regret using the word 'swarm'?  Earlier this summer, Mr Cameron was accused of ""dehumanising"" refugees after he described the thousands of people trying to cross the Channel illegally from Calais as ""a swarm"". Harriet Harman, Labour's acting leader, told him he ""should remember he is talking about people, not insects"". The Prime Minister has yet to apologise for using such inflammatory language to describe one of the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. Will he at least say he regrets using the word ""swarm""?   4. Will Britain support EU-wide project?  The expansion in the number of refugees Mr Cameron has promised to take in will be relocated from camps in the countries surrounding Syria and not any of the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have made it to Europe. It means the UK will not be helping countries such as Greece, Italy and Hungary who are forced to bear the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees as they lie on the borders of the EU and are often the first EU country that refugees reach.  More than 220,000 refugees entered the EU in the first six months of this year alone, with that number increasing by the day. The out-dated Dublin Regulation requires refugees to seek asylum in the first country they reach, but Mr Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, this morning demanded that EU leaders agree to a pan-European project to relocate 200,000 refugees, saying: ""No country can do it alone, and no country can refuse to do its part.""  @matt_dathan  Refugees Welcome: Supporters back The Independent's campaign",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,0,Policy

Under the planned deal, which leaders hope to confirm at another summit next week, Turkey would take back Syrian refugees who land in Greece in exchange for Euro 6bn in aid, easier visa access to Europe for Turks and a speeding up of stalled EU accession talks. But now Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades has said he will not lift his country's veto on opening five new ""chapters"" in Turkey's EU membership negotiations. ""I will never accept being forced, and I will never give my consent, because otherwise I have no other choice but to not return back home,"" he told the Financial Times. The veto has been in place since 2009, over Turkey's refusal to recognise the Greek Cypriot government in Nicosia or allow Cypriot ships to dock in its ports. An attempt to resolve the dispute that erupted when Turkey invaded northern Cyprus in 1974, dividing the island, had been making headway. Cyprus argues that this is the wrong time to give away any diplomatic leverage. Although Cyprus is blocking six of the 33 chapters, both Germany and France have also blocked parts of the negotiations. The proposed arrangement would mean sending back to Turkey every Syrian refugee who crosses into Greece illegally. In exchange, the EU would accept, on a one-for-one basis, Syrian refugees applying through legal channels from Turkey. It is due to be confirmed at a summit in Brussels at the end of next week. Turkey has addressed a key concern of human rights activists: that it is a ""safe"" country for the return of illegal migrants. Officials say they are planning new legislation, including readmission agreements, with 14 countries, such as Afghanistan. Ankara also says it will introduce a new personal data security law, roll out biometric passports, and tighten regulation of its border security agency as it prepares for the planned liberalisation of visa rules. The deal has nonetheless been criticised by the leader of Turkey's opposition party, which says Ankara should have offered the EU Euro 6bn to take all the refugees, rather than the other way round. ""Let us give Euro 6bn to them and let them take all Syrians, Afghans and Pakistanis themselves,"" Kemal Kilicdaroglu of the Republican People's Party (CHP) told the Hurriyet newspaper. Meanwhile, EU justice ministers agreed to adopt new anti-terrorism rules criminalising preparatory acts such as training, travelling abroad and financing terrorism.

Charities have long warned of smugglers abusing children, frequently forcing girls into prostitution to repay their ""debts"", but teenage asylum seekers in Sicily say they have been targeted by local men. Ermias Haile, a 16-year-old from Eritrea, has been sleeping on a building site with his friends since they arrived on the island after making the treacherous voyage from Libya. Like many others, they left an official reception centre for young refugees in the belief they would be forced to remain in Italy after applying from asylum, leaving them alone and unprotected. Ermias and friends told Sky News an Italian man had sexually abused them after buying them drinks and offering them shelter. ""He find us in a place like this [park] and he invite us to a bar and he let us drink beer and then he take us to his home and there he give us beer,"" he said. ""We start drinking and then he start touching us on our body. After we leave the house, he calls us and he gives us money."" Almost 102,000 asylum seekers have arrived by sea in Italy so far this year - 15 per cent of them unaccompanied minors. Most, such as Ermias, are picked up by rescue boats in the Mediterranean and taken to Sicily, where they are sent to local reception centres. But many leave the comparative safety of the accommodation, travelling to other European cities and often ending up homeless or trapped at borders such as in The Jungle camp in Calais, where several rapes have been reported. Save the Children said the number of unaccompanied children has doubled in the past year, seeing vulnerable boys and girls thrown into ""cycles of abuse"". Traffickers saddle girls and young women with up to Euro 50,000 (£43,000) in ""debt"" for the cost of their journeys across the Mediterranean before forcing them into prostitution and hard labour to pay it off. Boys are forced into similar schemes, subjected to child labour and criminal activity including theft and drug dealing by gangs. Children are also at risk at overcrowded detention camps on Greek islands, where all migrants are now held until their asylum applications are decided as part of a deal between the EU and Turkish government. Aid agencies say families are ""living in fear"" after fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries, with many afraid to let their children out of their sight amid rising tensions, protests and fights. Tanya Steele, Save the Children's interim CEO, said: ""It's shocking that in this day and age so many vulnerable children are being subjected to this kind of violence, manipulation and exploitation. ""They make the dangerous journey to Europe on their own seeking safety and a better life, but instead find themselves trapped in a cycle of abuse."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron responded to growing calls to house unaccompanied minors by pledging to resettle some of the ""most vulnerable"" refugee children in May, but none are believed to have arrived. The Home Affairs Select Committee has warned that the UK is on course to fall short of its pledge to house 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020, highlighting a huge backlog of asylum cases and decisions where refugees had been wrongly returned to violence and persecution. The British Government previously restricted its scheme to asylum seekers in UN camps in the Middle East and North Africa, arguing that it did not want to encourage them to make the ""lethal"" sea voyage to Europe.",Broadsheet,0,2016-08,0,Migration

In the four days since Aylan died, David Cameron has vowed that Britain will take in ""thousands more"" Syrian refugees and governments throughout Europe have reaffirmed their commitment to easing the continuing crisis.

The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said he is believed to have fallen and hit his head on train tracks while running from police. Hungarian authorities had stopped the train in attempt to force refugees to go to a nearby camp to register their asylum applications. Those who resisted, like this woman and her young child, were met with physical force. The refugees stuck in Bicske included those who had already been stranded in Budapest for two days after police barred them from entering the capital's main station to catch trains to Germany and Austria. Those who eventually managed to get on trains had to be forcibly crammed inside, including young children and babies. Many of the refugees in Budapest have travelled along the long land migration route from the Middle East through the Balkans. Some, like this family of refugees from Afghanistan, walk for hundreds of miles along motorways through countries like Greece and Macedonia. Others risk their lives walking along rail lines. A man died on Friday when he was hit by a train as he walked along lines in northern Greece, near the border with Turkey, in the dark. The driver told police he could not brake in time. Smugglers are also packing refugees into lorries for long journeys through Europe. The bodies of 71 men, women and children were found in an abandoned truck in Austria last week. Police believe they suffocated to death. The land route is being used by more and more refugees, partly as a consequence of deaths in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas.

Ms Nabasirye stayed with charity workers Anja Nyberg and Kristine Harris in their north London home for four weeks, before she was granted refugee status and moved to Stockton-on-Tees, where she now works and studies. The 35-year-old said the couple ""were like my family"". ""I felt so much at home,"" she said. ""They were really lovely people. I really did not want to leave but I had to move on. They have other people to help."" Ms Nabasirye had to leave Uganda, where homosexuality is punishable by up to 14 years in prison, when she was outed as gay. She was introduced to the couple by Praxis, a charity which launched a hosting service for vulnerable migrants three years ago, and which found accommodation for 80 people last year, including 20 who were hosted by British families. Ms Nyberg, 37, who is originally from Sweden, says she had reservations at first about letting a stranger into their home but the couple were aware of the plight of migrants due to her partner's work and they ""decided to give it a shot"". They have now housed four women for varying lengths of time, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months. ""Everyone says to us that we are such saints for doing this and it must be really hard, but we have been surprised at how easy it has been,"" Ms Nyberg said. This is partly due to the boundaries laid down by Praxis, who arrange a meeting to discuss a contract which lays out clearly what everyone should expect. Praxis also takes care of all the practical support, such as helping with immigration cases. Ms Nyberg said that being a host family has been ""an incredible learning experience"". ""It has challenged stereotypes that I might have had about migrants, but it can also challenge the misconceptions that migrants might have about life in Britain. We are expecting our first baby, so it has been good for Tushira to see how easy it can be for a [lesbian] couple here."" Puck de Raadt, a retired clinical psychologist who helped to found charities Bail for Immigration Detainees and Medical Justice, has been taking refugees into her home since 1998, when she went to Victoria station in London to pick up a Palestinian released from Haslar Immigration Removal Centre.

He found a job almost instantly, has not been unemployed since and never sought or received welfare benefits,"" she said. Since then, she has hosted dozens of people, including a young woman who had to flee her family, who had threatened to kill her, a woman who was a victim of forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and a man from Côte d'Ivoire who had been tortured there and had also spent many months in immigration detention in the UK. He has now finally rebuilt his life and will qualify next spring as a plumber. Ms de Raadt said: ""The UK Home Office practice of imposing indeterminate migration detention on such people is the worst thing for their already precarious mental health. No government will acknowledge the long-lasting and invisible public costs incurred by these short-sighted measures."" Similarly, Ms Nyberg said what motivated her and her partner was the knowledge that ""the Government systematically fails to take care of some of the most vulnerable people in our society"". Hosting is not the answer to this problem, she added. ""It's the Government which needs to step up to the plate, not just by accepting more refugees, but by radically improving the way that they deal with them when they arrive in the UK.""

""People don't queue up to house people in their own homes,"" he said. ""However, in the past couple of weeks I have had a lot of queries from people interested in helping."" Because the Home Office is so slow at processing asylum cases, it is rare to place a refugee for less than four to six weeks and the average stay is around three to six months. ""In self-catering accommodation you can't really provide that community support that you can get from staying with a family,"" he said. ""It can be an anxious moment before the host and guest meet.

The closure led to street protests outside and thousands started to make their way to Austria on foot.  Wednesday  Shocking images of the body of a young boy being recovered from a Turkish beach began to appear on news sites and social media. Turkish media named the boy as three-year-old Syrian, Aylan al-Kurdi, who died with his mother and brother in an ill-fated attempt to reach the Greek island of Kos.  Thursday  Newspapers put the pictures on their front pages. The Independent printed an image showing Aylan lying face-down in the surf.

Brussels intends the move will help to restore the bloc's migration policies, which collapsed under a mass influx in 2015. Under EU rules, the first country of entry is responsible for handling an asylum claim, but that system broke down last year in Greece, the main gateway to Europe for more than a million refugees and migrants.

That led countries along the route gradually to close their borders, stranding many in Greece, which struggled to offer them proper shelter. TheEuropean Commission on Thursday said Greece has improved in hosting and registering arriving asylum-seekers. It recommended thatEUstates be allowed to send back to Greece asylum-seekers who enter the bloc that way and make it deeper intoEurope from mid-March onwards. The recommendation does not apply to those who have already made that journey. ""This will provide further disincentives against irregular entry and secondary movements, and is an important step for the return to a normally functioning ... system,"" said the Commission's deputy head, Frans Timmermans. The bloc's asylum policy and its zone of internal free travel both collapsed last year as an uncontrolled flow ofmigrantsand refugees triggered bitter disputes betweenEUstates on how to handle them. These disputes remain unresolved and more than 62,000 people are still in Greece, even though anEUagreement with Turkey in March reduced the arrivals to a trickle. The failure is in large part due to reluctance byEUstates to take in people from Greece and Italy to help process their asylum requests and ease the burden on the two frontline states. So far, fewer than 8,200 people have been moved from these two Mediterranean countries to otherEUstates under a plan that was supposed to cover 160,000 people and which expires next September. The Commission called onEUstates to step up. ""Our aim is to relocate all those in Italy and Greece who are eligible for relocation within the next year,"" said the bloc's migration chief, Dimitris Avramopoulos. Brussels put additional conditions on returning people beyond March, saying Greece should give individual assurances of fair treatment for any returnees and that unaccompanied children not be sent back at all. Obligatory quotas on refugees are now the focus of a tug of war betweenEUstates seeking to reform their troubled common asylum rules. The Commission said arrivals from Turkey to Greece stood at an average of 92 people a day since March, compared to thousands that were making at times making it in a single day before the deal with Ankara. It said 1,187 people have been deported from Greece to Turkey since March 2016.

Syrians displaced across Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt were given food vouchers by WFP to spend in local stores. But now it has had to shut down the scheme saying it can only be reopened if a shortfall of $64m (£40m) is met. Britain appealed to other nations last night to give more to support humanitarian efforts in the region. Britain is the second largest country donor to the Syrian crisis, and has already committed more than £700m to tackling the humanitarian situation. A spokeswoman for the Department for International Development said Syrians ""urgently need the rest of the world to play their part - both in terms of pledging money but also making good on their promises"". It is the first time WFP has been forced to take such drastic measures during the Syrian crisis. In a statement yesterday the UN's nutrition arm said the withdrawal of food aid ""will be disastrous"" for families scattered across the region. The crisis comes ahead of what is expected to be another harsh winter, which many children in camps are facing barefoot and without proper clothes. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres, said: ""This couldn't come at a worse time. Winter is already an extremely difficult period for Syrian refugees, but the suspension of food assistance at this critical juncture is going to be devastating. It will impact tens of thousands of the most vulnerable refugee families who are almost entirely dependent on international aid."" More than 3.2 million people have fled Syria and another 7.6 million have been displaced inside the country since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began three years ago. Almost 1,700 people were killed in the conflict last month, the majority of them civilians, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. The WFP executive director, Ertharin Cousin, said: ""A suspension of WFP food assistance will endanger the health and safety of these refugees and will potentially cause further tensions, instability and insecurity in the neighbouring host countries. The suspension of WFP food assistance will be disastrous for many already suffering families."" The UN is understood to be increasingly exasperated at a lack of donations from wealthier countries in the region. A source said: ""It's a long-running frustration that particularly with these crises in the Middle East, the donors who don't seem to be coming forward are the Gulf states. They could be contributing more to the international humanitarian system."" Oil-rich states such as the United Arab Emirates and Qatar consistently give little to humanitarian efforts compared with economies of similar sizes. Last year UAE gave just $50,000 to all of WFP's projects, less than Swaziland, Peru or Madagascar. A pledging conference in support of UN humanitarian programmes in Syria, held in Kuwait at the start of the year, saw generous promises from around the world, but with one month of 2014 left, UN insiders say much of the money has not come through. The scheme is delivered electronically, giving people funds to spend in local shops, meaning there is little infrastructure required. Because of this the WFP says that if new funding arrives it will be able to resume assistance immediately. Experts are worried that the withdrawal of the scheme will add to existing tensions between refugees and local populations. The vouchers have injected an estimated $800m into the economies of refugee hosting countries which border Syria, but without money to spend in local businesses, refugees may face further resentment. £700m Britain's commitment to the Syrian refugee crisis, the second-largest",Broadsheet,0,2014-12,0,Aid

MICHAEL DAY reports Criminals netting $5m a trip 'have no hesitation jumping ship'","The Italian Coast Guard was last night towing the second unmanned ship containing hundreds of migrants to appear off its coast this week into port. The so-called ""ghost ships"" are a worrying new trend as human traffickers exploit desperate refugees bidding for a new life in Europe. The Lebanese vessel Ezadeen, which was discovered with about 450 passengers on board, is registered as a livestock vessel. But even cattle are not left to cross dangerous high seas in mid-winter with no crew and the vessel on autopilot. Coast Guard officers boarded the Ezadeen from a helicopter yesterday morning and navigated it towards Corigliano Calabro where it was due to arrive late last night. The practice of using ""ghost ships"" - filling rust buckets with refugees, pointing the vessel towards Italy and then fleeing with the passengers' life-savings - appears to be a worrying new development in human trafficking, the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, warned yesterday. The rescue of the Ezadeen follows a similar operation to save hundreds of migrants aboard another abandoned ship, the Blue Sky M, on Wednesday. ""We are seeing this new trend. It's apparent there have been other such incidents - maybe four or five in the past two months,"" said UNHCR spokesman William Spindler. ""But only when the Blue Sky M incident occurred this week, which involved nearly 1,000 people, did it capture everyone's attention."" Mr Spindler said it showed that human traffickers were changing tactics. ""They're using bigger boats and different routes to smuggle people.

Admiral Giovanni Pettorino of the Italian Coast Guard said that by charging hundreds of desperate refugees thousands of dollars at a time, gangs in North Africa and the Middle East were still able to make big profits by writing off ageing ships in the process of smuggling human beings. ""They purchase unseaworthy vessels for $100,000 to $150,000 (£65,000 to £97,000) and then fill them with hundreds of migrants, mainly Syrian nationals, who pay $6,000 each for the crossing from the Turkish coast to Europe,"" said Admiral Pettorino. He told the Adnkronos news agency that the criminals were netting up to $5m per trip and therefore ""had no hesitation about jumping ship, given the profit margins"". Last month the UNHCR described the Mediterranean crossing from the Middle East and Africa to Europe as ""the most lethal route in the world"" after a record 3,419 migrants lost their lives in 2014 crossing the sea. Although it has not been confirmed where the migrants aboard the Ezadeen come from, the UNHCR told The Independent it believed the number of refugees from Syria was rising sharply. In 2014 for the first time, people from refugee-producing countries - mainly Syria and Eritrea (as opposed to countries producing high numbers of economic migrants) - ""have become a major component in this tragic flow, accounting for almost 50 per cent of the total"", said the UN body. On Wednesday about 900, mostly Syrian, refugees arrived in Italy after they were abandoned by the crew of the Moldovan-registered Blue Sky M cargo ship, who had fled leaving the vessel on a crash course for the Italian coast. The Coast Guard also boarded that vessel and navigated it to port. The Blue Sky M drifted within five miles of the shore before six navy officers were lowered on to the ship by helicopter and succeeded in bringing it under control. One migrant aboard the 48-year-old Ezadeen, which is registered in Sierra Leone but has Lebanese owners, managed to operate the vessel's radio and contact the Italian Coast Guard on Thursday night. By this point the ship's crew had fled, leaving it to plough a The Coast Guard notified the nearby Icelandic patrol boat Tyr, which was in the area on a mission with Frontex. The Tyr drew alongside the runaway ship, but huge waves made boarding impossible. A Frontex spokesman said: ""It was not until some hours later, when the vessel carrying the migrants ran out of fuel, that five Icelandic officers were able to get on board, attach a tow rope and bring the ship under control."" Yesterday, six Italian Coast Guard officers were lowered from a helicopter on to the deck of the 73m-long Ezadeen to take control and navigate the vessel to the Italian mainland. Frontex said the migrants aboard were ""visibly distressed but overall in good medical condition"". They have been given food, water and basic medical assistance. Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marini said the nationality or nationalities of the migrants was not yet clear. He added: ""What is clear is that among them there were lots of children and women, including some pregnant women. What we know for now is that the ship left from a Turkish port and that the crew fled.""",Broadsheet,0,2015-01,0,Migration

We have waited five days for such an announcement - for the millions of Syrians who have fled their country's civil war, time is not on their side. These are the seven questions Mr Cameron must answer when he stands up in the House of Commons this afternoon.   1. How many?  The Government has refused to expand on the Prime Minister's promise of ""thousands more"" and Downing Street was yesterday guiding against reports that 15,000 would be given refuge in the UK.  It is understood the figure will be more than 10,000, but this is number would appear a drop in the ocean compared to the 15,000 that Germany welcomed in just the last two days. Francois Hollande has piled the pressure on Mr Cameron to make a meaningful pledge, announcing that his country will take in 24,000 Syrians.  Anything less than 10,000 will be seen as a disappointment from the chorus of political leaders in the UK, a growing number of Tory MPs and even his own ministers.  The Green party's demand that the UK accept 240,000 refugees may sound very ambitious, but it would still only account for a third of Germany's expected intake of 800,000 this year.  2. Where?  No details have been mentioned by Downing Street as to where the ""thousands"" of Syrian refugees will be housed. Will these vulnerable people, who have lived through four years of war, be given access to the essential services they will be very much in need of? Ms Cooper set out a detailed proposal for the UK to accept 10,000 refugees by housing just 10 families in each London borough. She has met local authorities, faith groups and voluntary organisations from across the country to work out what help they can provide. Has the Government undertaken similar co-ordinated action to find the places and safety that so many Syrians need?   3. Why won't Britain support EU-wide project?  The expansion in the number of refugees Mr Cameron has promised to take in will be relocated from camps in the countries surrounding Syria and not any of the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have made it to Europe. It means the UK will not be helping countries such as Greece, Italy and Hungary who are forced to bear the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees as they lie on the borders of the EU and are often the first EU country that refugees reach.  More than 220,000 refugees entered the EU in the first six months of this year alone, with that number increasing by the day. The out-dated Dublin Regulation requires refugees to seek asylum in the first country they reach, but Mr Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has said: ""No country can do it alone, and no country can refuse to do its part."" The European Commission now plans to introduce a mandatory relocation scheme to spread those refugees who have already arrived in Europe across the continent, but the UK has refused to sign up to the plan.  Mr Cameron must explain why he is refusing to help those Syrian refugees and why he refuses to help countries like Hungary, Greece and Italy with the burden of housing hundreds of thousands of newcomers.  The refugee crisis - in pictures  4. Will there be military intervention in Syria?  Will Mr Cameron step up the Government's case for launching airstrikes against Isis targets in Syria?  Several to step up its fight against Isis by targeting them in Syria as well as Iraq but any airstrikes would need the backing of Parliament.  Having suffered a defeat in the Commons over a move to bomb President Assad's regime two years ago due to Ed Miliband's Labour party voting against it, the Government does not want to suffer another embarrassing defeat. The Prime Minister said last week that the Government would be unlikely to seek Parliamentary approval for airstrikes in Syria without a ""genuine consensus"" in the UK, suggesting that a victory in the Labour Party leadership election for Jeremy Corbyn, who opposes military action in Syria, could curtail any such move. But George Osborne suggested a vote could be called even if the new Labour leader opposes military intervention by securing enough support from Labour backbench MPs to outweigh the 30 Tory MPs who are understood to oppose intervention.

How will extra aid money be spent?  Last week the Prime Minister promised an extra £100m of money towards the humanitarian crisis surrounding Syria, taking Britain's contribution to more than £1bn since the civil war began four years ago.  Yesterday George Osborne announced a ""fundamental rethink"" of Britain's international development spending, saying money would be redirected towards tackling the problems of ""failed states"" such as Syria.  But exactly where and what this money will be spent on remains unknown. Will it simply be providing more money to resource-starved refugee camps in neighbouring states such as Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, or will there be a shift in strategy along the lines of creating safe havens within Syria itself?  This was an idea mooted by the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who said this morning that Britain should consider sending British troops into Syria to create a UN-organised effort to set up ""humanitarian safe enclaves"" in the country.   6. What safeguards are in place to guard against incoming terrorists?  As Nigel Farage pointed out, the influx of thousands of refugees from Syria poses the potential danger of extremists entering Britain. What checks will the authorities undertake to ensure jihadists are not let into Britain through the back door?  Mr Cameron's statement to MPs is set to include counter-terrorism announcements, which might address these concerns.   7. Does the Prime Minister regret using the word 'swarm'?  Earlier this summer, Mr Cameron was accused of ""dehumanising"" refugees after he described the thousands of people trying to cross the Channel illegally from Calais as ""a swarm"". Harriet Harman, Labour's acting leader, told him he ""should remember he is talking about people, not insects"". The Prime Minister has yet to apologise for using such inflammatory language to describe one of the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.

But the Prime Minister is now under intense pressure to go further by accepting 500 refugees under a United Nations resettlement programme. Last night, Nick Clegg broke ranks with Mr Cameron by making public his private lobbying for a change of heart by the Government, which has refused to join the 18 Western countries who have signed up to the UN plan. The Deputy Prime Minister agrees with Labour that Britain should admit about 500 Syrians. He hopes to persuade Mr Cameron to change his mind before Labour forces a Commons vote on the issue next Wednesday. The Prime Minister's partial retreat came after Labour raised in the Commons the letter signed by 25 aid agencies and refugee groups, published in The Independent on Saturday, calling on the Government to think again. Mr Clegg said: ""I am full of admiration for the work The Independent has done in repeatedly raising awareness of this issue on its front page."" Aides revealed that the Liberal Democrat leader had been ""arguing for weeks"" inside the Government for the UK to back the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which wants Western nations to accept 30,000 of the 2.3 million Syrians who have fled their country. A source close to Mr Clegg said: ""We are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and Nick believes we have a moral responsibility to help. He not only believes the moral case for doing this is overwhelming, he also thinks the political case for action is unarguable as well."" The source added: ""The Coalition Government has been the most generous in the world [after the US] when it comes to helping with the humanitarian crisis in Syria and it would be completely self-defeating to allow ourselves to be painted as the least generous. The Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case around the Cabinet table. We have yet to gain the agreement of our Conservative colleagues but we remain hopeful we will."" When Ed Miliband raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: ""Where there are extreme hardship cases, I think we should look at this again."" He added: ""If there are cases of people who don't belong in refugee camps, who have either been disabled by these dreadful attacks, or are in very difficult circumstances, I am happy for us to look at that argument."" Mr Cameron said one child refugee was already being treated in a British hospital. But Downing Street was unable to say how many Syrians might be helped by his more flexible approach. Last night, it denied the Prime Minister had announced a change of policy. His official spokesman said: ""What we are doing is listening to the arguments about how we can help the most vulnerable people and we are going to do that and then set out how we propose to do that. We haven't taken final decisions around the best and the most effective way of doing that."" Mr Miliband was ""somewhat encouraged"" by Mr Cameron's move, saying the Government was ""gradually inching forward"". But Labour sources said it was ""shameful"" that the UK would still not join the UN resettlement programme. Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, said: ""It is very disappointing that the Prime Minister was so resistant to signing up. Nearly every other European nation, the US and Australia are helping out. It is not a replacement for aid; it is additional help for the most vulnerable victims of war. There is cross-party support for doing more. We will hold a debate on this next week to show the Government the strength of feeling, and hope MPs from all parties will join us."" Earlier, Jim Murphy, the shadow International Development Secretary, quoted from the aid and refugee groups' letter, which asked: ""How can we call on Syria's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees if we keep our own under lock and key?"" Mark Pritchard, one of several Tory MPs pressing for a full U-turn, said: ""I hope a cross-party consensus can guide the UK's humanitarian response and the refugee issue doesn't become a party-political issue. The Government does appear to be softening its policy, which is welcome."" Mr Cameron told the Commons: ""I don't believe you can solve a refugee crisis of this scale - when you've got almost half the nine million population of Syria either displaced or at risk of displacement -with a quota system where countries are taking a few hundred refugees."" He accused some EU countries of accepting a small number of refugees rather than providing humanitarian aid. ""I think we are fulfilling our moral obligations to the people of Syria,"" he said. ""The fact that the Finns, the French or the Swedes are going to take a few hundred people, that is not fulfilling your obligations."" Anna Musgrave, advocacy officer at the Refugee Council, welcomed Mr Cameron's move. ""For every person rescued from the region, a resettlement place would be life-changing,"" she said.

The body of three-year-old Aylan changed the media narrative of this crisis and many more poignant images have been circulated. We have seen Laith Majid clutching his children as he sheds tears of joy after surviving Aylan's same journey, as well as children clambering through the windows to board packed trains in Macedonia, and a couple cradling their baby after desperately throwing themselves on train tracks as police try and take them to migrant camps in Hungary. Alongside these images of children and mothers, phrases such as ""among the dead were X many children and women"" are also used to stress the innocence and vulnerability of those who have died. I can understand why this might be a particularly compelling focus, but it raises the question: are Syrian men not innocent and vulnerable too? READ MORE:Surprised that Syrian refugees have smartphones? You're an idiot12 Syrian refugees a day for 5 years? That's hardly a response, Cameron David Cameron has now pledged to take in 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years, and singled out vulnerable children and orphans. This wasn't limited to one side of the political spectrum. Before his announcement, the former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett called on the Government to take 25,000 refugees over the next sixth months, and said that Syrian women and children should be given priority. So far this hasn't proved controversial - everyone seems to agree that young people and women require the most attention. But we must be careful not to forget that this is a humanitarian issue, and one that affects an entire population. Otherwise, the message we're sending is that the lives of Arab men do not matter. The refugee crisis - in pictures If our humanitarian sympathies are only summoned in response to children and families, then we risk dehumanising Arab men. This only helps to reinforce a history of Western misrepresentation, in which Arab men are viewed as dangerous, uncivilized, barbaric, and incapable of reason. This might not seem immediately obvious from their absence in the media's coverage. But the invisibility of the Arab men allows these ideas to insidiously fill the gaps, sometimes even subconsciously. When the media prioritises women and children over Arab men, it's easy for many people to conclude that this is for a reason, and that there is something inherently less valuable about them. And as it's hard for many Westerners to view the Middle East through anything but the lens of conflict, where Arab men are supposedly hell-bent on killing each other, their deaths seem inevitable, whether it's on the battleground or at sea. The children, as symbols of potential on the other hand, we can grieve for. We have been in this situation before. During World War Two, the British Government launched the Kindertransport programme, which rescued thousands of Jewish children from Nazi Germany during the late Thirties. The memory of this has been evoked as part of the Government's plan to take in Syrian refugees, and has helped further entrench the idea that it's only children whose lives are worth saving. Yet Syrian refugees are also fleeing as families, as well as individuals. Many of these adults are from middle-class or relatively affluent backgrounds with skills that would be of immense economic benefit to the countries they flee to. They're also just as human, and just as terrified of death, even if they're better at not showing it. In society's eyes, men might not symbolise vulnerability in the same way children and women do, but this should never lead us to give up on them.

More than 3.2million Syrians have fled the country and another 6.5million are homeless within the country's borders, making the conflict the largest forced displacement crisis in the world, according to human rights charity Amnesty International.

Asylum applications jumped 39 per cent from a year ago to 19,043 in September, and bureaucratic bottlenecks mean more than 2,000 claims are waiting to be registered in Munich. A public outcry at television images of refugees arriving at Munich station has led to the ruling party, headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, to launch an ""asylum task force"". The prosperous conservative government (CDU/CSU) are concerned that more support is directed toward a new rightist party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), in light of the immigration influx. Horst Seehofer, Minister-President of Germany, said: ""We will not overcome this challenge if we wear party political spectacles. There must be joint action by the federal, state and local government."" Authorities may also be using the Olympic stadium site in Munich as temporary accommodation for refugees, the city's newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung revealed. Asylum seekers receive (EURO)140 a month in benefits, but the majority are keen to give back to the growing economy, according to a report by the BBC. AfD launched last year as an anti-euro party with tackling immigration at the centre of their policies and its national ratings rose eight per cent, helping it win seats in parliament. Spokesman for AfD, Konrad Adam, said this month: ""The right to political asylum...has become an uncontrolled right to immigration and to stay for an almost unlimited time.

Growing fury in Germany over New Year's Eve assaults on women in Cologne Ulla Jelpke, an MP for the left-wing Die Linke party, criticised it as ""excessive"". ""Those who apply for asylum are exercising a fundamental right,"" she told   Der Tagesspiegel.  ""That must not be linked to costs, even in cases were applications are rejected."" Swiss authorities recorded 112 cases where assets over 1000 francs (£690) were confiscated from asylum seekers last year, when around 45,000 refugees arrived in the country. The state secretariat for migration said anyone who leaves voluntarily within seven months of arrival can take their money and belongings back. Denmark finalised legislation to do the same last week, but increased the threshold to 10,000 global (£1,015) and exempted sentimental items like wedding rings in the wake of international outrage and internal opposition.

The debate comes as thousands of refugees from the Middle East and Africa continue to arrive on European shores every day. At least 46 people drowned on Friday as two overcrowded smuggling boats drowned on their way to Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

Nick Clegg, who has been pressing David Cameron for weeks to admit hundreds of refugees, said the UK would open its doors to women and girls who had experienced or were at risk from sexual violence, the elderly, the disabled and survivors of torture. Mr Cameron overruled objections from Theresa May, the Home Secretary, who wants to do everything to ensure the Conservatives meet their target to reduce net migration below 100,000 by next year's general election. ""He realised that, although we are the good guys and the second largest donor of humanitarian aid to Syria in the world, we were in danger of looking like the villains,"" said one Government insider. Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council, which co-ordinated two open letters to Mr Cameron published in The Independent, said: ""This isn't about party politics, it's about compassion and the Refugee Council is delighted the UK Government looks set to deploy a full spectrum of solutions in addressing the greatest refugee crisis of our time."" He added that The Independent deserved ""the highest praise"" for its sustained coverage of the issue. Britain will not join the UNHRC programme to resettle 30,000 Syrian refugees, which Mrs May warned would set a precedent, so it will not fix a formal quota. But the UNHRC has backed the Government's move and will work closely with it to identify refugees in urgent need of help. ""We are not focused on a target, we're focused on helping the most vulnerable,"" said a Whitehall source. About 500 Syrians are expected to come to the UK over the next year. Mr Clegg said: ""The Coalition Government wants to play our part in helping to alleviate the immense suffering in Syria. ""We are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and I believe we have a moral responsibility to help. Sadly we cannot provide safety for everyone who needs it, but we can reach out to some of those who need it most."" The Deputy Prime Minister's announcement takes the heat out of a Commons debate on the issue today called by Labour. The Government's previous hard line had raised the prospect of an embarrassing defeat amid all-party criticism of its stance. Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, who led the demands for a U-turn, said: ""Compassion and common sense have prevailed over government and ministerial resistance."" She added: ""Given the considerable flexibility in the UN programme for countries to set their own priorities, numbers and security checks, the benefits of not running parallel bureaucracy and the value of being able to encourage other countries to follow suit, the Government would be best to sign up with the UN."" She said ministers now need to confirm that the 500 would not be at the expense of the 750 refugees the UK accepts every year. She called for refugees to be exempt from the Tories' migration target Syamend Farhan, a Syrian refugee living in Manchester, welcomed the Government's move, saying: ""I am very happy to hear that because I lived what they are living???The first thing they are going to escape is hunger, and the risk of dying. Getting a passport in Syria at the moment is impossible. People aren't able even to move to Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan. I was lucky, I already had a passport.""

Many people have also died while crossing the Mediterranean in rickety boats. The UN estimates 2,030 people died in 2017 alone. The situation in Italy was described as ""an unfolding tragedy"" by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. ""But this cannot be an Italian problem alone,"" he said. ""It is, first and foremost, a matter of international concern, requiring a joined-up, comprehensive regional approach."" The Italian Government has already filled up its 200,000 beds for migrants, and a government source told Reuters last week that the country had reached ""saturation point"". EU migration commissioner Dimitris Avramopouloshas already promised that the EU is ready to increase financial support for Italy to manage the flow of people. Refugee crisis: More than 500 migrants rescued in single day in Mediterranean Sea But as the will wanes in Europe to help migrants, Italy has toyed with the drastic idea of blocking ships, exceptthose from its own coastguard and military. Humanitarian groups have warned that any attempt to block rescue boats would violate international law. Italy has already closed its borders to prevent migrants from travelling through Europe over land. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea stipulates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of circumstances, and that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking passengers off the ship.

Help is needed; Even with peace, it will take years for the refugee situation to resolve itself","The Syrian conflict is about to enter a sixth brutal year, with more than 250,000 Syrians dead and more than half the population displaced. By far the majority have clung to safety in neighbouring countries, especially Jordan, but increasing numbers are turning to Europe. This desperate situation has put enormous pressure on our global system. Community fears have collided with core social values, putting new strains on the principle of ""united in diversity"" - which is, after all, not just the EU motto but a basis for co-existence worldwide. It is apparent from the shattered lives of children washed up on Europe's shores that our current approach to handling refugee crises is not working. It is time for a new response that takes better account of the realities we face. Extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. Tomorrow, the nations of the world will gather in London to address the Syrian refugee crisis. This conference comes at a critical juncture, when we have an opportunity not only to ease the heart-rending suffering but to safeguard the future for my region and Europe as well. This is a conference in which we all must step up for the stability of the region and for the opportunity to bring peace to Syria. It will test our will and ability to act as one - to save human lives, to protect human dignity, and in doing so, to save the future we share. Read more The Tories are creating a one-party state - and nobody gives a damn This requires from us a new paradigm for action. Recognising that the crisis is complex and protracted, our strategy can no longer be focused on emergency and humanitarian relief alone. It should be based on sustainable development-based goals. Three requirements must shape our approach. First, the international response must be sustainable over the longer term: this crisis is too large and too widespread to end soon, even if the political process for a settlement in Syria makes progress. Second, our response must recognise Jordan among key regional host countries as the lynchpin of global action: to invest in our refugee response is to support an ally that can lift a burden that would otherwise fall elsewhere. Third, our initiatives must be comprehensive, to meet the complex crisis of refugee displacement and lay the groundwork for it to end with a positive future ahead. Even if the Geneva peace conference moves forward, even when Daesh and its cohorts are defeated, it will likely be years before the refugee situation resolves. This means years more pressure on displaced people and the communities and countries hosting them. The needs of both must be addressed on a stable, viable basis. Refugee-related costs now consume 25 per cent of Jordan's national budget. The economies of the US and EU combined are more than $35 trillion (£24trn) and they are grappling with the influx of slightly over one million refugees. By comparison, Jordan's economy is less than 0.001 per cent of the US and EU economy combined and has been coping with an even greater challenge of hosting nearly 1.3 million Syrian refugees. Read more The UK has paid Eurotunnel 8 million Euros to stop migrants entering This is not to mention the refugees Jordan received during previous and ongoing conflicts. The amount of external shocks − the countless disasters and wars that we had no role in, but had to contend with over the decades − is unprecedented. To assure that Jordan will be able to continue carrying the burden of Syrian refugees, it is vital to provide immediate support to the country's infrastructure. It is also essential to ensure that doing the right thing does not come at the expense of Jordan's youth and the opportunities our next generation will have in life. And, finally, creating new job opportunities through industry, trade and investment is an essential part of our comprehensive approach, now and for the future. The world needs to build hope for the refugee population we host, so that they become effective citizens in the future of Syria, equipped with education, skills and opportunities. The alternative is to push refugees to despair, crime, and dependence. It is not an alternative we can live with for our region, for Europe or for the world.

Four months ago, both were married off to much older Saudi Arabian men. But after 20 days, the men disappeared. Their parents were paid a dowry of 5,000 Jordanian dinar (£4,200) for the two girls. Their father was asked at a local mosque whether he had any daughters. The matchmaker, a fellow Syrian, then proposed that they marry two Saudi friends. Nawar's husband was 55, Souza's 45. The men promised to relocate the entire family to Saudi Arabia. But now the family live in a single mouldy room in Amman, their dreams dashed. Luckily neither of the girls is pregnant. ""There's just regret, regret about what happened,"" says Nawar. After 20 days in a furnished apartment, the sisters had been sent home to their parents. Their husbands would return to Saudi Arabia to settle the paperwork and return shortly, they were told. But the girls have not heard from them since, and their Jordanian mobile phone lines have stopped working. The marriages are not legal under Jordanian law; they were performed by a local sheikh and with two witnesses, but were not registered at the court. Nawar says she had no idea her husband would disappear. During their brief union he told her about the rosy future they would have in Saudi Arabia. ""He took me to nice restaurants, he took me on trips and he promised to take me to even nicer places in Saudi Arabia,"" she says. She married the older man out of a sense of duty to her parents; they were in a difficult situation. ""I didn't love him,"" she says. Described as an ""economic coping strategy"" for refugees fleeing Syria's civil war, such early or forced marriages are on the rise. Syrian women are famed for their beauty and intelligence, making them desirable as wives, says Dr Amira Mohamed, a counter-trafficking officer at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Amman. ""We hear lots of stories about brokers who take girls from the Syrian community and do matchmaking for marriage, for local men and men from abroad. And the marriage will be very short term, it could only last 24 hours, just to give a legal cover for sexual exploitation,"" she says. Early marriages are a tradition in Syria. A United Nations study found that almost half of Syrian refugees consider it normal for girls to marry between the ages of 15 and 17. For many of the refugees, most of whom come from rural areas, this is attitude is part of their tradition, says Dr Mohamed. ""But from a human rights point of view it's a violation."" The IOM has started an awareness campaign to teach people about human trafficking, including sexual exploitation. The scale of the problem is unclear as official numbers are not available, but at least one new case is reported daily via a 24-hour hotline. Most of the unions are prompted by economic necessity. Many of the refugees have lost everything. Nawar's family arrived in Jordan with a debt of almost £3,000. ""We were in a very bad situation and had very little money. Then this offer [of marriage] showed up,"" says her mother. ""I wanted to pay our debts and have a life like we had before in Syria."" They were also hoping that marriage would offer the girls protection, both financially and physically. Instead, the marriages have been kept a secret, and the girls have been forbidden to tell any of their friends back home in Syria. Their father, Abu Bashar, hopes that his daughters will be able to remarry to ""nice respectable men"". He will never marry them off to a Saudi Arabian again. ""Not even for 10,000 dinar,"" he adds. The sexual exploitation of women in such circumstances is not new. ""Refugees find themselves in a situation where they sell whatever they have. For a woman it is typical either to work in a domestic situation or to do sex work,"" says Dr Mohammed. In one of the capital's nightclubs, the stage is filled with 20 women in tight-fitting, bejewelled evening gowns. ""All of them are Syrian,"" says the waiter, gesturing towards the dancing throng. During the evening, the women chat to the male clientele, and make arrangements for meetings later. A thick layer of make-up fails to mask the girls' age - at least four look well under 18. When asked, they all provide the same story, saying they are of age and started working at the club four months ago through a friend. ""No, of course I didn't used to do this in Syria,"" says Bouchra, a chubby girl from Damascus in a powder-blue gown.

While rebuilding work has already begun in earnest -every family reconstructing their own shelter with help from the local Lebanese community -it does not mitigate the sense of loss for many. Souriya'sfamily's case is complicated by the fact they were missing the right permits and papers in the first place. Talking about the house she had dreamed about, Souriya began to cry. ""I don't understand,"" she said, her children sitting around her. ""They're telling me I'm not able to have my own tent [or the new one her father was building].

Now Philip Hammond has dubbed the thousands of desperate people gathered in Calais a ""marauding"" threat to Europe. Hearing migrants described in the language of pestilence or invasion is sadly not unusual - but for those words to come from the mouths of the Prime Minister and his Foreign Secretary marks a shift in the politics of fear. The sight of crowds of frightened refugees gathered at a port more accustomed to holiday-makers has prompted not sympathy but revulsion and anger. As the debate over immigration to Britain reaches a hysterical pitch, the Government seems to be stoking the most reactionary views rather than calming them. Even the former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell balked at the language coming from his Conservative party colleagues. ""These are human beings who are in desperate straits and desperate circumstances,"" Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday. ""My colleagues choose their own language, but these are human beings who are in desperate peril."" The vast majority of the estimated 3,000 people in Calais are refugees from Syria, Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan. They have not gathered to ""invade"", but because they were willing to risk everything in search of safety. Last summer I travelled across Europe from Milan to Calais with Emad, a Syrian who already has refugee status in Britain, and his mother Nawal. Theirs is one of 10 migrant stories I told in a book, Finding Home. After Nawal was threatened by secret police in Damascus, Emad got himself thousands of pounds in debt paying smugglers with connections to Isis to bring her across the Mediterranean on a near-deadly broken fishing boat. Emad had tried several times to apply for Nawal to join him in Britain legally but was repeatedly turned down; the Home Office argued it had no obligation to help as she was not a dependent. When they reached Calais, they hoped to claim asylum at the UK border but were turned down. Nawal was handed to French border police who, instead of stamping her passport ,which would mean she was their responsibility, deliberately handed it back to her. Just as Italians had knowingly avoided taking her details after her rescue at sea, France knew if it looked the other way, she might become another country's problem. After putting thousands more pounds into the hands of smugglers, Nawal eventually made it to the UK squashed between two Kuwaiti men in the hollowed out underneath of an estate car belonging to British gangsters. Today she has refugee status and is living in London happily. It is baffling to her that Britain's immigration system encouraged her to give money to criminals rather than resettling her legally. Britain has historically had a proud tradition of providing refuge to those fleeing war and persecution. But the latest figures show that - far from being swamped by the number it helps - the UK is not pulling its weight in Europe. Since the crisis in Syria began in 2011, Britain has taken around 2 per cent of Europe's Syrian asylum claims. Under a resettlement scheme for Syrian refugees, Britain has accepted just 187 people, according to the latest figures. The remaining 6,700 who have claimed asylum here over the past four years either arrived as visitors or smuggled themselves into the country. If those numbers sound high, consider that 89,000 Syrians sought asylum in Germany and Sweden took in 62,000. The picture is similar for asylum from other nationalities. In the first quarter of this year the UK took just 4 per cent of all new asylum claims in Europe with 7,335 - a tenth of Germany. Life for refugees is harder than ever in Britain. A shake-up by the Home Office means that from this week asylum-seekers have taken a cut in the already meagre cash they are allocated for looking after children. A single parent with one child, for example, will now receive just £10 a day to cover both of their living costs, a cut of 24 per cent. Since asylum-seekers are forbidden from working until their claim has been processed, the new policy is expected to push thousands of children further into poverty. While politicians in Britain choose to present the continued attempts to get here from Calais as being about the UK's ""generous"" welfare policies, others believe the surge in activity at the port has more to do with French politics. Hundreds of undocumented migrants were moved from squats in Calais to a single site 7km from the city by local authorities in April this year. Called ""the New Jungle"", it sits on a former rubbish dump with no access to power or water. And, as local politicians no doubt intended, it is so unpleasant that the need to move on has become more pressing. Meanwhile, just offering a helping hand to an undocumented migrant in France can result in fines of more than £20,000 and up to five years in prison, which has discouraged many support networks from giving out food and other essentials. The idea that migrants are in Britain to sponge off the state does not stand up to scrutiny. Most non-EU nationals who are subject to immigration control are not allowed access to public funds, such as Jobseekers' Allowance or tax credits. Far from leeching off Britain, it is widely accepted that migrants have a significant economic benefit. Research at University College London last year estimated that recent non-European migrants made a net contribution of £5bn to the economy between 2001-2011. Migrants from Europe also contributed £20.2bn. Despite the weight of evidence in favour of migrants, those making their case have to acknowledge that figures do little to calm a debate that has always been more about gut feeling and identity than economics. If we are to take on such emotional responses, encouraging our politicians to talk about asylum-seekers as human beings would be a good place to start.",Broadsheet,0,2015-08,0,Policy

The sources in Berlin said they expected EU leaders to reach an agreement by qualified majority vote on the distribution of 120,000 refugees across Europe when they meet for a migrant crisis summit next Wednesday. ""A lot of lobbying has been going on. There are one or two governments which have said 'we will comply but we need to be outvoted to claim that we did our best to oppose this',"" the source said. Apart from migrant quotas, Wednesday's summit is expected to focus of providing more aid and resources to Turkey, where an estimated two million predominantly Syrian refugees are being given sanctuary. ""Recent lack of funding for refugees in Turkey is one of the reasons why they are now making for Europe,"" a source said. Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is on a visit to Turkey where he is expecting to hold talks with the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. An EU-wide deal on refugee quotas would be a breakthrough for Ms Merkel's coalition government. Germany has said it is prepared to take in between 800,000 and one million refugees during the current crisis - more than all of the rest of the EU combined. It has asked other EU states to share the load - so far without success. There are strong objections from eastern European states including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, the Baltic States and Poland. However their opposition now appears to be crumbling.

The vote came as EU leaders were due to gather in Brussels today for an emergency summit to tackle the escalating migration crisis. Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the proposal to set binding relocation quotas of asylum seekers for each EU member state, as part of a plan to ease the strain on countries that are the first point of entry for most refugees, such as Greece or Italy. The relocation proposal, unveiled two weeks ago by the European Commission, allocates refugees to each member state based on how big they are, how rich they are, how many asylum seekers they already have, and their unemployment rate. The Czech government earlier indicated that compulsory quotas were illegal and that it could take the issue to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. At the same time, the Hungarian parliament yesterday passed a resolution calling on its government to ""defend itself by every necessary means"" against ""waves [of] illegal immigration"". The measure was strongly backed by Germany and France. Yet even among its supporters, there are growing concerns about whether a mandatory regime can be enforced. Some officials have admitted that refugees fleeing war and crossing seas and continents are unlikely to accept orders to stay in, say, Slovakia, when they really want to be in Germany. But German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière insisted that this would not happen. ""Refugees cannot decide to which country they want to go. If they want to move somewhere else, they will be sent back to the first EU country to which they were allocated,"" he said. Britain, which has an opt-out from such migration issues, has refused to take in any refugees from overstretched frontline EU states. Instead, it has said it will resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees from outside Europe over the next five years, with the government last night saying the first had arrived in the UK. Home Secretary Theresa May last night urged her counterparts to ""get on with the job of the wider measures that need to be taken of ensuring that we are breaking the link for economic migrants between making this dangerous journey and settling in Europe"". Mrs May said: ""We need to return those people who are illegally economic migrants and who have no right to be here and ensure that people arriving at Europe's borders are being properly dealt with, properly fingerprinted so that decisions can be made and when they are illegal economic migrants, they can be returned."" As well as endorsing the quota deal, EU leaders are today due to discuss longer-term strategies for dealing with the crisis, particularly increasing cooperation with Turkey and the other countries bordering war-torn Syria, where an estimated four million refugees are currently living. European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, has said that the EU needs to help Syrian refugees find a better life closer to home. He has called for more aid to the World Food Programme and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He also wants to strengthen the EU's asylum agency, Frontex, into a full border and coastguard agency, and has said drawing up a list of ""safe countries"" whose citizens would not normally qualify for asylum, would also be up for discussion. 20,000 Syrians to be accepted by UK",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,1,Policy

It referred to a few hundred Syrian refugees who the United Nations was trying to resettle because they might not survive in the camps created by that country's civil war. These were some of the most desperate people alive today: wounded orphans, torture victims and recent widows.  But while many of our international allies, including the Europeans, Americans and Australians, signed up to the UN's humanitarian initiative, the British Government refused. It was wrong to do so, and this newspaper is leading the campaign to make it change its mind.  Last Saturday, we published an open letter from 25 of Britain's leading charities to the Prime Minister. In the House of Commons on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, reiterated his support for that letter, while a source close to Nick Clegg told our Political Editor, Andrew Grice, that the Liberal Democrat leader is campaigning hard for this inside government.  Yesterday, we published another open letter, this time from 55 peers. The shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper - who, incidentally, wrote editorials for The Independent in her career before politics - wrote a powerful article explaining why Labour is calling a vote in Parliament next week on the subject. Momentum, in other words, is building. Yet the Government remains indecisive, partly because David Cameron is under intense pressure from some of his Conservative comrades to avoid being seen as soft on immigrants. He and senior ministers have argued that Britain is already providing £600m of aid for Syria, and that you don't solve a refugee crisis by letting a few hundred of them into Britain. The first point is true and admirable. The second is ludicrous. Nobody, and least of all this newspaper, is suggesting that the horrors experienced by Syria's refugees will disappear if a few hundred of them are let into Britain. But each extremely vulnerable orphan, torture victim and desolate widow granted refuge in our country is a moral victory for us - and a potentially life-saving chance for them. It is also, by the way, good politics, because it aligns us with our allies and keeps Britain on the moral high ground in world affairs. As that Liberal Democrat source told us, it would be ""self-defeating to allow us to be painted as the least generous [country]"". Sometimes in politics you should put your hands up and admit you've got it wrong.

It is one of a number of groups that is providing aid and assistance to people stuck in the French port town on their way to the UK. Syed Bokhari, the organisation's joint-secretary and one of the people apparently detained, said that the detention was part of a persistent ""campaign"" against the group's activities.

In September doctors who had visited the camp warned that the people in the camp, a mixture of refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrants, were living in appalling conditions.

Ministers have previously raised concerns that action to help refugees, including rescue from drowning, would act as a ""pull"" factor and encourage people to make the journey. Other countries, most notably Germany, have accepted hundreds of thousands of refugees. A study released by the European Commission on Thursday found that countries taking the most refugees would receive ""sizable"" economic benefits in terms of GDP, employment rates, and long-term budget sustainability. Three million people are now expected to arrive in Europe by the end of 2016, according to the Commission.

""No room at the inn,"" was The Independent's front page headline. After a series of articles by my colleague Jamie Merrill and I, and growing pressure from politicians and aid groups, David Cameron bowed to strong behind-the-scenes lobbying by Nick Clegg and climbed down. The Deputy Prime Minister announced that 500 of the most vulnerable refugees would be allowed into Britain. But Cameron refused to join 16 nations in the UN scheme. The U-turn took the issue out of the headlines. There was little controversy five months later when we revealed that only 24 Syrians had been given sanctuary. Ministers then explained that the 500 refugees would now be admitted over a three-year period. When the Syrian refugee crisis hit the front pages again this June, the new Conservative Government raised the 500 figure to up to 1,000. So far, only 216 have arrived from the camps in countries bordering Syria under the UK's go-it-alone resettlement scheme. This pattern of behaviour was repeated after the refugee crisis finally cut through to the public when the haunting photograph emerged of three-year-old Aylan al-Kurdi lying dead on a beach in Bodrum, Turkey. Cameron announced on 7 September that Britain would take up to 20,000 Syrians. A dramatic departure but again, our old friend ""up to"" is there. It could give the Government an escape hatch to accept fewer. Again, a headline-grabbing figure is not as immediate as it looks; this one will be achieved over the next five years. Officials insist the intention is to admit 400 Syrians a month from the refugee camps from next month. But given that only 216 have arrived in 20 months since the original U-turn, there is scepticism that such a rate will be maintained. Again, an act of ""compassionate Conservatism"" seems to have been dragged out of a reluctant Cameron by damaging headlines. Again, he was running to catch up with public opinion instead of leading it. Again, Britain will act in splendid isolation, working with the UN but eschewing the EU's scheme to accept a total of 160,000 refugees. I am told that Angela Merkel had private doubts about the European Commission proposals but knew instantly when the pictures of Aylan flashed around the world that Germany would have to sign up. A revealing difference between the British and German leaders. EU officials acknowledge Cameron's intellectual case that advertising a scheme welcoming refugees would encourage more of them to head for Europe. But morally and politically, the EU had to act. Although Hungary opposes compulsory quotas, other central and eastern European nations seem to be softening in order to show solidarity. They recognise what Merkel describes as ""the biggest challenge"" facing Europe she has known - bigger than the eurozone crisis which almost forced Greece out of the single currency. The refugee crisis - in pictures But Britain has dismayed its EU partners by shunning the refugees scheme, citing its opt-out on asylum policy. ""Technically right, politically wrong"" is the view that predominates in Brussels. Cameron can point proudly to the UK providing more than £1bn of humanitarian relief - mostly for the refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - a much better record than other EU countries. Despite the scenes on our television bulletins, only 0.3 per cent of the 4 million Syrian refugees have reached Europe, Cameron aides say. He can deflect accusations of populism by reminding us that he has stuck to his pledge to keep overseas aid spending at 0.7 per cent of gross national income. It is true that, on migration, the Prime Minister must juggle very different demands from the public, Conservative MPs and the EU. He faces pressure from the same three directions as he renegotiates Britain's EU membership terms ahead of the In/Out referendum he intends to call next year. Although Cameron aides insist that migration and the new EU deal are ""two distinct issues"", that is not how things are seen in Brussels: in a 28-member club, everything is linked. Cameron's decision on refugees will harm his prospects of winning concessions in the renegotiation. ""There is a lot of finger-pointing going on,"" one government source admitted.  Cameron would like to hold his referendum next spring or by next autumn at the latest. But recent events could force a delay. First, the EU's existential crisis on migration means that other leaders may be reluctant to fiddle with the annoying ""British problem"" while the Treaty of Rome burns. Second, there is no mood to go the extra mile for a country that refuses to take part in the EU's refugees programme.

When the Prime Minister attends the next EU summit on 15 October, he will be looking for progress on a new agreement for Britain. But his counterparts will have their minds firmly on the refugee and the migration crises. Cameron should temporarily waive Britain's opt-out on asylum and take part in the EU quota scheme - as Ireland has already done by agreeing to accept 4,000 Syrians. ""It would buy a lot of goodwill and transform the landscape for the British talks,"" said a diplomat from another EU nation. A good deal would make the referendum more winnable.

LAURA PITEL reports from Kilis on Ankara's increasingly inhumane efforts to put up the barricades,"Turkish border guards are routinely attacking Syrians attempting to cross illegally into Turkey, refugees and campaigners have claimed. Families who fled the recent fighting in Aleppo told The Independent that officers had opened fire as they tried to reach Turkey with the help of smugglers. Others spoke of heavy beatings for those caught after attempting to slip across. Turkey has cracked down on its border security amid heavy pressure from the US to limit the transit of jihadist fighters seeking to join Isis. At the same time, the European Union has urged Ankara to stem the flow of refugees setting off towards Europe in dinghies from Turkey's western coast. As EU leaders prepare for a key summit with Turkey on Monday, aimed at preventing a repeat of last summer's influx, they face warnings that they must also encourage Turkey to grant safe passage to those trying to escape a war zone. Turkey insists that it maintains an ""open door"" policy towards Syrians, but human rights groups say that, for the past year, only those with serious or urgent medical conditions have been allowed to cross. Ankara does not deny that border guards sometimes open fire on those crossing illegally. ""In certain cases, the border patrol has no option but to fire warning shots because they often come under attack from smugglers and terrorist groups on the Syrian side,"" a senior government official said, while insisting that the border force had an ""outstanding track record"". Syrians say that Turkey's policies are pushing them into the arms of greedy and unscrupulous smugglers - and that guards use excessive force on those fleeing in fear for their lives. Aliya Radwan, a grandmother from the town of Hraytan in northern Aleppo, was cowering from air strikes in a neighbour's basement when she decided that she had to leave. She knew that she and her family would not be allowed into Turkey at the Bab al-Salama crossing, 25 miles to the north. She had friends among the tens of thousands from Aleppo province who had already flocked to the border but were sleeping in the open after being barred from entering Turkey. Instead, she turned to a smuggler. He took her family to a crossing at the town of Khirbet al-Jawz in neighbouring Idlib province. On their first attempt to cross on a dark, rainy night last month, they were forced to retreat in terror after border guards opened fire. They managed to sneak through undetected on a second attempt. Others were not so lucky. A young widow who fled heavy bombardment in Aleppo two months ago, who asked to be named only as Fatima, said that she saw border guards shoot a young girl making the same journey. ""She didn't speak Turkish so didn't understand when they shouted 'Get away!'"" she recalled. ""The guards opened fire."" She did not know whether the girl had lived or died. Amnesty International reported last month that hospitals in Azaz, a town near the Turkish border, were receiving two civilians a day who had been shot while attempting such crossings. It said that, in one case, a child aged 10 died after being shot in the head. That claim was echoed by Dr Ali al-Saloum, an orthopaedic surgeon at a hospital in Azaz. He said that the number of cases waxed and waned but, during the worst periods, it was common to see two people a day who were shot trying to cross the border. He had seen victims old and young, including a one-year-old baby girl, who died after being shot in the head. Dr Saloum said that, while the problem had been going on for some time, he believed it had grown worse. ""It used to be much rarer,"" he said. ""And when it did happen it was people being shot in the leg of the arm. But people started dying."" He said there was a bitter irony in the ultimate fate of some of those most badly injured while trying to reach the neighbouring country. ""The funny thing is that, with the most seriously injured people, we don't have the necessary specialism or intensive care services. So we get them transferred to Turkey."" Some of those seeking to sneak into Turkey have suffered heavy beatings. Aktham Alwany, 28, a Syrian activist and journalist, said he was beaten on two separate occasions after being caught attempting to enter Turkey illegally to visit his mother, who has cancer. On his first of three attempts to cross via the Syrian-Kurdish enclave of Afrin, he says that he was stopped, beaten and detained. His mobile and laptop were taken. After being released, he tried again, near the Turkish town of Kilis. As he and others attempting to cross illegally jumped down into a trench that demarcated the crossing, border guards opened fire, he said. He gave himself up, he said, and was hit over the head with a rock. He claimed to have suffered heavy bleeding from his forehead and nose, followed by period of memory loss. A photograph taken by doctors shows his face streaked with blood. He said that he eventually made it into Turkey after paying a border guard $1,000 to hide in the back of a goods truck. His experience motivated him to make a documentary about the problem. In the course of filming, he met people who were attacked with dogs, who suffered broken ribs from beatings, and a mother whose child was shot. Mr Alwany said that he did not solely blame Ankara. ""I want to be fair, it's not only related to Turkey,"" he said. ""The issue is bigger than Turkey."" But he warned that people already fleeing Syrian and Russian bombing, the tyranny of Isis or the attacks from rebel groups, now faced a fresh danger. Andrew Gardner, a Turkey researcher for Amnesty International, said that it was ""abhorrent"" that people seeking protection should find themselves facing live fire at the border. He called for regulated safe border crossings for Syrians and urged the EU to ""live up to its responsibilities"" towards asylum seekers so that Turkey - a country that already hosts 2.5 million Syrians - did not have to shoulder an unfair burden. He said: ""Without those two things, these tragedies on the borders will be replayed again and again.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-03,0,Conditions

In a high-stakes game of political chicken, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the EU wouldn't be able to reach the ""final point"" and end its ties with Turkey forfearof jeopardising a deal to curb the flow of migrants from Africa and the Middle East to Europe. Hours later, in Brussels, EU enlargement commissioner Johannes Hahn bluntly said that ""it is time Ankara tells us what they really want,"" in the wake of a report assessing Turkey's status as a candidate for membership in the bloc. The report highlighted what the EU saw as backsliding on essential human rights and rule of law standards. Read more Erdogan attacks US plans to work with Kurds fighting Isis in Raqqa  Turkey's Erdogan says 'I don't care if they call me a dictator' Iraq 'ready for war' with Turkey over who should control Mosul The report, issued Wednesday, came after Turkey's recent clampdown on media freedoms and the arrests of 10 pro-Kurdish legislators. ""These various actions, including considerations of reintroducing the death penalty, seem to be increasingly incompatible with Turkey's official desire to become a member of the European Union,"" Mr Hahn said. ""In its own interest, Turkey urgently needs to stop moving away from the EU,"" Mr Hahn said. In the escalating standoff on Turkey's protracted membership bid, Mr Erdogan rose to the challenge. ""They say unabashedly and shamelessly that the EU should review its negotiations with Turkey,"" Mr Erdogan told a business group in Istanbul. ""You are late, go and review them as soon as you can. But don't just review them -go and make your final decision."" The Turkish leader added: ""You know those threemillion refugees in Turkey? They say there is a problem. What if the negotiations end and they open the gates, where would we put those threemillion refugees? That is their worry. That is why they cannot come to the end point."" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the EU had to stop its ""threatening"" attitude. ""Make a decision, brother,"" Mr Cavusoglu said. ""If you want the negotiations to stop, then stop them. If you want them to continue we are ready. But you have to treat us as equal partners. We cannot advance as long as you see us as second-rate country."" Omer Celik, the minister in charge of Turkey's EU negotiations, criticised the union's report. He called it ""far from being constructive or providing guidance"" and said EU leaders lacked ""vision and the ability to produce projects."" On the visa-free travel deal, Mr Celik said Turkey was determined not to alter its anti-terrorism laws. He said EU VicePresident Frans Timmermans would arrive in Turkey for discussions on the issue. ""If we can reach progress during talks with Timmermans, this will be recorded. If we cannot, then this process will have died toward the end of the year,"" Mr Celik said. In March, Turkey and the EU reached an agreement in which Turkey would stem the flow of refugees and migrants to Greece in return for incentives including fast-tracked membership talks, billions of euros in aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens. The deal has hit a hurdle over Turkey's reluctance to change its anti-terrorism laws -one of the conditions for the lifting of visa restrictions on Turkish citizens traveling to Europe. On Tuesday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, warned Turkey that its crackdown on political opponents and the media goes against EU values. Mr Juncker also called on Mr Erdogan to immediately say ""whether Turkey really wants to be -yes or no -a member of the European Union."" He added that the Turkish leader would only have himself to blame if the EU does not grant visa-free travel in Europe to Turkish citizens soon. Turkey has been in talks to join the European Union since October 2005, but progress has been held up, often by political opposition and particularly due to resistance from Cyprus, an EU member. The Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops occupied its northern third following a coup by supporters of a union with Greece.

Speaking to The Independent at the start of a trip to Brussels to lobby EU leaders to do more, Salil Shetty said the bloc's historical reputation as a beacon of human rights was at risk unless countries including Britain stopped ""putting politics before people"" and tackled the abuses. ""First and foremost it's a question of doing the right thing, which is what human rights is about, but politically how do you actually preach to others if you don't practice it yourself?"" said Mr Shetty, Secretary General of the global human rights watchdog since 2009. ""It's very paradoxical - that's the thing about both the EU and the UK in particular: these are places which one would expect to be champions of human rights,"" he added. While European leaders including David Cameron have called for more humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, the borders largely remain closed to the 2.3m Syrian refugees who are living in wretched conditions in camps in neighbouring countries. In a letter published in The Independent on Saturday, 25 leading charities including Amnesty called on Britain to welcome more refugees fleeing the three-year-long conflict, as concerns mounted that Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon can no longer cope with the exodus. So far, only 14,000 Syrians have been resettled in Europe, Mr Shetty said, with Britain yet to step forward and offer to house any new refugees under a UN scheme. ""It will give much more credibility to the Europeans on Geneva II (peace conference) if they actually take some concrete action,"" he said. For Syrians who do make it to Europe, they suffer appalling conditions in detention and holding centres in countries like Greece and Bulgaria. Other pay with their lives. In the past year, hundreds of migrants and asylum-seekers have died at sea after embarking on dangerous journeys from Syria and other Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan nations. With no legal route to get to Europe, desperate people will continue to take risks, Mr Shetty said. EU heads of state are due to discuss migration policy at a meeting in June, but so far the focus has been on reinforcing security and keeping people out of what Mr Shetty refers to as ""fortress Europe"". Much of the reluctance of governments to step forward and accept more refugees stems from political concerns ahead of European parliament elections in May. Disillusionment at the economic crisis and austerity is expected to translate to a surge in support for populist and anti-immigration parties. Discrimination and hate crimes are also increasing, with minorities - and in particular Roma - facing deep prejudice. Mr Shetty called on the European Union to use legal measures which are at its disposal to tackle any form of state discrimination, and urged member states not to pander to political extremes. ""It's at moments like this that we need leadership and statesmanship, it's not a matter of saying that's what a few people believe in,"" he said.

António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said more still needed to be done to provide adequate reception facilities at points of transit, and to properly screen arrivals to separate those in need of protection.

This winter, however, there is anguish and disquiet in the air. The dark and brutal hand of the Syrian civil war has cast a shadow over the town, and shared with it some of the misery that it regularly casts upon the Syrian landscape. The lonely beaches on this part of the Turkish coastline are some of those from where thousands of refugees board rubber dinghies nightly, in a desperate effort to make it to one of the nearby Greek islands of Chios, Lesbos or Samos. Since the beginning of 2015, more than 3,700 migrants - most of them refugees fleeing war and other hardships - have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean, many in these waters. On Tuesday, 34 people - seven children - lost their lives when their boat capsized. Some of the bodies washed up on beaches a few miles north of Cesme. I visited Cesme before Christmas with GOAL. The aid agency has commenced programmes to support Syrian refugees in Turkey. This will complement their work to support one million people affected by the war inside Syria. We spent some time initially in Izmir, Turkey's third-most populous city, which is located approximately 80km inland. Izmir is one of the main destination points for refugees fleeing the war in Syria - and it is not difficult to find them there. Hundreds of families walk the streets of the city's popular Basmane district, where shops that normally restrict their trade to clothes and luggage items, now include cheap life-jackets and inflatable rubber rings. The impact of the crisis in Cesme wasn't as obvious on arrival. But we didn't have to look far. One local cafe owner told us: ""My friend is a fisherman. He takes out his boat and goes fishing very early each morning. He normally catches two or three big fish. Last week, his line caught on something else. It was the body of an eight-year-old boy.""

Soon, there were around people walking towards us. Some carried children, others walked hand-in-hand with their partners. The only sound was the crunching of feet on gravel.

One man stopped to talk. An Iranian, he had been sleeping out in the open for four days. Like millions of Syrians, he and many more Iranians have fled violence and repression too, although not nearly in the same numbers. Others had been there for almost three weeks.

It is unclear if the pair were ratted out by migrants or were identified when the group were met by officials. If convicted they will go to jail in Cyprus and not in Britain, a source explained. The mainly Syrian refugees have been staying in a disused hangar since arriving at RAF Akrotiri on Wednesday. But insiders say they could be moved to a camp on British soil within days. The ""temporary transit facility"" is on a UK base near party town Ayia Napa. Brit taxpayers are funding the camp, which sits on land designated as UK soil in the country's 1960 independence deal. It is near Richmond Village, where migrants have lived at the UK taxpayers' expense since 1998 as they fight to find a country to take them.

In so doing he tried to break out of the narrow political discussion about how to help those on the run from despotism and societal failure in the Middle East and beyond. The pontiff spoke wisely about the moral duties of the individual towards those in need. Governments are, however, faced with a more complex challenge in dealing with the migrant exodus: how to strike a balance between democratic accountablity to their own needy citizens, how to keep an eye on the national interest and how at the same time to address the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. The Pope's chief task on Lesbos, a small Aegean island that has had to adapt to an influx of many tens of thousands of people washed up on its shores, was to make clear that Europe should not shun but embrace the refugees. The rhetoric of the far right that they represented some kind of Muslim assault on Christian Europe was itself un-Christian. The Good Samaritan did not help a fellow Samaritan but a Jew. Christian tolerance thus has to extend not just to Christians but to everyone, irrespective of race, religion or class. It was, said the Pope, up to ""all of our brothers and sisters on this continent"" to demonstrate fraternity, solidarity and respect for this mass mobilisation of peoples. Refugees had to be treated as individuals - not rendered faceless by the ""globalisation of indifference"" - and welcomed by individuals. To dramatise the message he took twelve Syrian Muslim refugees back home with him. The Vatican, of course, is not troubled by a huge influx of Muslims and as a theocratic mini-state does not have to concern itself as to whether multiculturalism works for all of its 450 citizens. Three Syrian families will not destroy the fabric of the Vatican City, any more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians accepted by Britain over the next four years will paralyse our country's schools and institutions. It was a gesture by a pontiff born of Italian immigrants (to Argentina) and directed not only at European Union states but also at the United States, indeed at all countries whose foundations were built by immigrants. The Good Samaritan parable informs individual behaviour by questioning how to confront misery that can be relieved. It is less useful when applied to governments who, according to the Pope, have ""the responsibility to welcome"", creating jobs and opportunities. The British government has chosen its own form of Samaritanism: it has become one of the world's top providers of aid to countries adjoining Syria. Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are bursting at the seams with refugees and by helping them in the camps we are actively stabilising the neighbourhood. Now this aid has to be more carefully targeted: on preventing a lost generation of Syrian children, by boosting literacy, by training camp inmates in the skills needed to rebuild their country. It is sad that the Pope did not address this question: the dilemma of the refugee eventually returning to a broken state. Lampedusa in 2013, Lesbos at the weekend; that is just the beginning of this papal mission to the frontlines of this enduring crisis.

One man interviewed by immigration officials after claiming asylum said that he had paid the amount to be taken from the French coast near Dunkirk to Whitstable in Kent. There have been landings at other Kent beaches since the new route opened up last summer. French authorities have stopped a number of rigid inflatable boats carrying migrants close to their coastline. The National Crime Agency (NCA), which fights organised crime, said yesterday that there was evidence of peoplesmuggling gangs being displaced from Calais and Dunkirk. Smuggling was on the rise at ports including Hull, Immingham in Lincolnshire, Tilbury, Purfleet, Newhaven and Portsmouth. Britain has asked the Belgian and Dutch authorities to tighten port security. The NCA's Project Invigor taskforce is closely linked with Europol in The Hague and works with police in France, Italy, Greece and across Europe. British officers are stationed in smuggling hotspots such as Greece and Sicily, and the organisation is forging links with the African countries where many migrants begin their journeys. One official said it was hoped that British officers might be able to work in Libya, where improving weather was making the crossing to Italian territory more viable. Hopes of establishing links with the Libyan government of national accord were dealt a blow yesterday when it refused international assistance to tackle terrorism and peoplesmuggling because of fears that foreign intervention would harm unity. The prices that migrants were charged to be smuggled to Britain varied widely, the NCA said. Iraqis could pay £4,000 for an overland journey or £13,500 to travel by air, a ""service"" that included high-quality forged travel documents. Some young men arriving in Folkestone had paid £400 to be hidden in a freight train; others were charged twice as much to cross the Channel inside a tanker lorry. Hundreds of British criminals - often from immigrant backgrounds - are involved in smuggling people in France and northern Europe and are being investigated by the NCA. They include Jamal Owda, a Palestinian national, who was arrested in Liverpool in December and is fighting extradition to Greece on suspicion of leading a network that smuggled thousands of Syrian refugees into Europe. Lynne Owens, director-general of the NCA, expressed concern that a British exit from the EU would weaken the fight against people-smuggling by disrupting collaboration. ""Serious and organised crime isn't constrained by geographical jurisdictional boundaries,"" she said. ""Therefore, to tackle it effectively, we have to be able to cooperate closely and share intelligence in an agile way.

""It got 3,000 retweets and people all over the world sent messages saying, 'How can I help them? I want to buy his pens',"" Mr Simonarson said yesterday. Within 30 minutes of Mr Simonarson posting a request for information on the unknown Syrian, using the hashtag #BuyPens, a Beirut-based businessman said that he recognised the man from his route to work. Other Lebanese Twitter users found the man and bought him a phone. His name was Abdul, they learned, and he was a refugee from Yarmouk, a Palestinian refugee camp in a besieged Damascus suburb that has seen brutal fighting. He had been a chocolate maker until the Syrian civil war caused him to flee with his wife and their two children, Reem, 4, and Abdelillah, 9. His wife left the family and divorced him three years ago. The man is among more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees thought to be living in Lebanon, many of them in abject poverty.

Within 30 minutes of setting up the fund, it had generated $15,000. By yesterday afternoon the total had surged past $50,000. Mr Simonarson said that he was in contact with a local charity - Lebanese for Refugees - so that they could help Abdul to handle the money. Unicef was also involved, he said. ""Abdul is such a lovely man,"" said Carol Malouf, the charity's founder, after visiting his home.

Tufail lies at the tip of a finger of Lebanese territory that pokes eastward into Syria - the most precarious of locations. To the north, east and south, Syrian troops are poised to attack; to the west, the rebels face assaults from Hezbollah, a powerful ally of Damascus. The assault could form part of a rapid onslaught on key rebel operations in the run-up to the Syrian presidential elections on June 3, with President Assad said to be eager to prove to voters that he has made significant progress in smashing rebel positions. Tufail has already been shelled by the Syrian army. Basil Sayyed, a refugee, said: ""We have nothing in Tufail. There is no water, no medical help, no police, no army, no electricity, very little food. We are cut off and can't go anywhere."" On Monday, the Syrian Coalition, the main political opposition body, said the Assad regime was preparing to ""commit a new massacre"" in Tufail against Syrians fleeing the Qalamoun region, which lies north of Damascus. The nearest Lebanese village to Tufail is 13 miles to the west, along a dirt track that winds across the mountains. Hezbollah had sealed off the track but, last week, under a deal brokered by the Lebanese government, agreed to remove the barricades to allow a relief column of Red Cross ambulances and lorries carrying food, diesel and mattresses to reach the village. As the medics and aid workers, escorted by Lebanese soldiers, gathered at Ram al-Marjouha, a 7,400ft mountain pass, in preparation for the journey east to Tufail, Hezbollah men eyed the proceedings from their outpost of bulldozed earth walls and green military tents. Several camouflaged firing positions were on the mountainside. The aid convoy received a warm welcome in Tufail. The Lebanese government had announced that any Lebanese citizen in Tufail was free to leave, but Syrian nationals, including the refugees, had to remain behind. However, despite the threat of a Syrian military incursion, almost all the residents opted to stay.

""Our relative was there, murdered in front of us, and we could not even bury her,"" Fadi al-Ahmed, the dead woman's cousin, said. ""Damn the people who did this."" Ms al-Ali, 26, died in the narrow strip of no man's land between Turkey and Syria, the latest Syrian to have been shot dead by Turkish border forces as they tried to cross the frontier illegally. She was not trying to leave Syria, however, but to enter it. Recently divorced from her husband of two years, she had decided to return to her family in the city of Deir Ezzor, now torn between the Syrian regime and Islamic State. The Turkish government insists that it maintains an open-door policy for Syrian refugees whose lives are in imminent danger. For the past year, however, those who try to leave the increasingly chaotic war zone are finding the frontier slammed shut. Official border crossings are closed to all but those who have life-threatening injuries or who work with the humanitarian agencies that deliver aid across the frontier. Anyone who wants to cross must hold identification documents. Those who don't must pay hundreds of dollars to people smugglers. There is growing evidence that refugees trying to leave war-torn Syria via smuggling routes are now systematically shot at and occasionally beaten by Turkish border forces. This week Human Rights Watch released a report detailing eight such incidents in March and April, backing up testimonies collected by The Times. Documents seen by The Times show that last month Ms al-Ali applied for the papers that she hoped would allow her to cross the border through the Bab al-Salam crossing, 30 miles north of Aleppo. Mr al-Ahmed said that it was after permission was denied that she decided to make the crossing illegally. On Monday night she met two other women, a child and a people smuggler close to the town of Akcakale, 100 miles east of Kilis. According to one of the other women, they were fired on soon after they had clambered through the first barbed-wire fence and into the buffer zone.

Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans topped the list of applicants, with more than a third travelling to Germany, according to the data from Eurostat. A number of smaller EU states recorded increases in applicants of up to 800 per cent between 2014 and 2015 as an unprecedented number of migrants headed into the EU from wartorn parts of the Middle East and Africa. Asylum applications in the UK rose by 19 per cent to just under 39,000, leading MPs to warn that the country faced an ""impending shortage"" of accommodation for migrants. Eurostat, the official statistics organisation for the EU, said a record 1,255,600 first-time asylum seekers applied for international protection in the 28 member states in last year, up from 562,680 the previous year. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for lower immigration, warned that the EU needed to get a grip on the number of those claiming asylum who were economic migrants. ""This is a very huge number of arrivals and it will be difficult if not impossible to separate out those who are really economic migrants. But unless the EU succeeds in doing this, the numbers will simply snowball,"" he said. ""Already of the 493,000 initial decision [on applications] taken in 2015, 47 per cent were refused but capacity for removal is extremely weak."" Syrians accounted for the highest number of claims, at 362,800, which was double the number in 2014. The number of Afghans almost quadrupled to 178,200 and those from Iraq rose seven-fold to 121,500. The figures also showed that more than 65,000 Albanians and 66,800 Kosovans claimed asylum in the EU. Migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq made up more than half of all first-time applicants in the EU last year. Germany has received by far the largest number of asylum seekers at 441,000, with almost half of the Syrians who applied registering in the country. Finland had the sharpest increase in applications, rising 822 per cent to 32,150. It was followed by Hungary, where applications increased by 322 per cent to 174,435 and Austria (233 per cent to 85,505). The number of applicants to the UK was 38,370, with most coming from Eritrea, Iran and Pakistan. The government has pledged to take 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020. The number of people claiming asylum in the UK as a proportion of the population was 591 per one million inhabitants, the highest level for 11 years. The figures emerged as thousands of migrants remained trapped on the Greek-Macedonia border after the latter continued to block their entry. Only a small number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees were being allowed across the razor wire to a registration camp near Gevgelija.

If the donors regard this simply as a fundraising exercise, they will have failed. If they embrace radical plans to bring jobs, wages and education to camps where there is now only desperate need and inadequate aid, they will have turned a corner. The UN-sponsored Syrian donors' conferences have become a bleak annual reminder of the scale of the humanitarian disaster that President Assad has inflicted on his nation. They have always failed to meet their targets, with a combined shortfall of more than £4.5 billion since 2013. This year's conference may or may not reach its goal of £5.4 billion in new pledges. But it differs from its predecessors in one important respect: it is the first since 2015's great exodus to Europe. More than 550,000 Syrians entered Europe last year. Vastly more chose to remain in camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. These countries' combined Syrian refugee populations now number at least 4.5 million. If they are not offered compelling reasons to stay, the number heading for Europe this year and next will only rise. Such is the argument being made by aid agencies attending the conference. The logic is hard to fault, and it vindicates Britain's policy of targeting aid at refugees where they are most in need, rather than at those seeking asylum in the EU. The question is whether it is really possible to turn camps into special economic zones, and in the process ease the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. To judge from recent remarks by King Abdullah II of Jordan, there is no option but to try. ""Sooner or later the dam is going to burst,"" he said of the pressure on his country's borders and public services from an estimated 1.5 million refugees. The mood of Jordanians themselves, he said, has reached ""boiling point"". It would be foolish not to take King Abdullah at face value. Syrian refugees comprise a fifth of Jordan's population. In Lebanon the figure is a quarter. Turkey has absorbed a bigger influx but it represents only one in 30 of its population. The figure for the EU is one in 500. Barely one in 20 of the refugees in camps on Syria's borders at the start of last year opted to make the dangerous journey to Europe. Half of those now stranded in Jordan have told charity workers that they would attempt the trip if their conditions do not improve, but surveys suggest that with the prospect of work and schooling for their children, most would stay. Syria's neighbours and the agencies working with them will receive a cash injection from today's conference. Brussels has already pledged (EURO)2 billion, nearly twice as much as last year. In return host governments will be expected to be more generous with work permits. This is a step forward. At present, only 1 per cent of refugees in Jordan work legally, with the dismal result that half the Syrian refugee families there count a child as a main breadwinner because children are less likely to be punished if caught. Legalising work will not be enough. There must be work to do. Without substantial job-creation schemes, handing out work permits to refugees will only drive down wages in already depressed economies. Germany's economic development minister is to promote a project to create 500,000 short-term jobs in camps close to Syria. Most would be in construction of schools, clinics and water supply systems for the refugees themselves. British experts will advocate granting certain camps special access to EU markets, but the detail so far is thin. The task for this conference is to provide it. Without a comprehensive plan to improve life for Syria's refugees as close as possible to Syria, the crisis to come will dwarf the one Europe faces today.",Broadsheet,1,2016-02,1,Aid

That is even more so for those with poor or nonexistent English, particularly where the treatment is for very serious illnesses such as cancer, kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis or for plastic surgery to treat extensive burns"", the report said. Parents were ""heartened"" that their children can catch up on lost education at school, but there could be improvefurther ments in English language provision and more help with finding work. Councils said that attendance rates at English for Speakers of Other Languages courses were relatively low among women with young children, those who were not literate in Arabic or English, and among a small number of 18 to 24-year-olds, mainly men, who were not in work, education or training. The UNHCR conducted the study with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and City, University of London to monitor how those who have already arrived in the UK have integrated. A total of 167 refugees from the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) were interviewed, more than half of whom were previously refugees in Lebanon, with the remainder travelling from Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UNHCR's representative in London, said: ""The UK clearly has the capacity to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees. Integration of refugees is complex. By and large it is working, and support for integration - from the public, local authorities and government - has been striking. We hope that, with development, this model can help more refugees from Syria and elsewhere resettle here after 2020.""",Broadsheet,1,2017-11,1,Migration
5116,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,21/12/2015,648 words,NA,"Hope for the Syrian girls who face marriage at ten; Christmas Appeal Tom Coghlan Zaatari Camp, Jordan","A little girl in a yellow dress sits, thin shoulders hunched, and swings her legs back and forth, back and forth. Ten-year-old Aisha doesn't look like a girl due to be married, but until the intervention of War Child that was her fate. In the vast desert refugee camp at Zaatari, Syrian families are making desperate decisions. Aisha's mother is an exhausted looking woman with five children and no husband. ""When the war started he left me, curse him,"" she says, while her children look at the floor. Facing a future of chronic insecurity she has had no choice, she says regretfully, but to begin marrying off her daughters. The decision is not uncommon in the camp. Aisha's older siblings sit nearby dressed in headscarves and high heels. They say they are 15 and 16, but it is hard to believe and charity workers are dubious. A man of about 30 is the fiancé of the younger of the two. ""He is a good guy and we need a protector,"" their mother said. ""In the camp when a girl leaves the house you are really afraid for her. If they can find good husbands then why not? Their father abandoned them."" It is dealing with complex tragedies such as this and alleviating the suffering of a lost generation of Syrian children that is the focus of War Child's work at Zaatari. The small British charity runs two programmes offering support and education to 260 children at any one time. For 81,000 Syrians, Zaatari is a refuge from war where they receive food and basic shelter, but it is hardly a place where hope abounds. The host nation, Jordan, is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. It is struggling to cope with 630,000 registered Syrian refugees and perhaps the same number again living outside the camps. Zaatari's residents cannot work and are forbidden by the Jordanian government to leave the camp confines, unless it is voluntarily to return to Syria. It is a measure of their lack of hope that more than 16,000 have chosen to return to their homes since August. As a freezing wind whistled round portable buildings and tents from a featureless horizon in early December, children were cracking the ice on puddles wearing open plastic sandals and, in many cases, no socks. In these bleak confines, War Child has created a series of what it calls ""child friendly spaces"". The fenced areas provide a safe space to play and be with other children, along with teaching facilities to make up for some of the lost education. They are places in which, however briefly, the children appear carefree. They echo to the sound of excited voices, laughter and songs. Many of the children, such as Aisha, are deeply troubled by their experience of war. Her mother reports that Aisha was so traumatised by Syrian government barrelbombing raids that she did not speak at all for more than a year and most of her hair fell out. Today her hair has grown back, she smiles and nods shyly in response to questions and hangs around in the background as other children play. She still rarely speaks. There is a kind of desolation that flickers behind the eyes of many children at Zaatari. Aisha is one of them, though she is by no means the worst afflicted. Saving Aisha from becoming a child bride has been one small victory for War Child, a beneficiary of The Times Christmas Appeal. After weeks of delicate negotiation Aisha's mother eventually accepted that it was not a good idea for her to marry. War Child brought a doctor to the camp to back up their appeals with a warning of the medical dangers. Aisha's mother says she is grateful for the charity's support. ""It is having a big impact on her,"" she says, as Aisha looks on - smiling silently. The equity brokerage Aviate Global kick-started donations for War Child with a gift of £100,000. ICAP, the leading markets operator, is matching donations made by readers to War Child up to £100,000. The Vitol Foundation will also match donations up to £100,000. Graphic   Aisha with her brother.

After a six-hour flight from Beirut, the new arrivals started their lives in Scotland in the most low-key and mundane manner. Well-wishers who had planned to gather to show their support cancelled their plans after the Scottish government appealed for members of the public to stay away ""to protect the privacy and security of vulnerable refugees"". There was an increased police presence outside the international arrivals gate, with officers cradling machineguns, but very little for them to do. There were no welcoming committees, no protesters, no banners and no sign of the new arrivals. It is understood that the Syrian nationals, who had been housed in camps throughout the Middle East, were quickly whisked off the aircraft and had their details processed behind closed doors. They were taken by bus, gazing out at the leaden skies, biting cold and relentless rain, to the local authority areas where they will be resettled. An airport spokesman later confirmed that they had been deliberately kept away from public areas. The charter flight was the first to bring Syrian refugees to Britain, but it will not be the last. The government has pledged to rehome 20,000 refugees by 2020, with 1,000 due to arrive by Christmas. Scotland has agreed to take 2,000 of the total number. Those who arrived in Glasgow are from refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and other countries near Syria, and are thought to include people suffering from health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Humza Yousaf, Scotland's minister for Europe and international development, described their arrival as a ""proud day"" and made light of the heavy rain that greeted them, quipping: ""At the least the welcome will be warm."" The SNP cabinet member said: ""These people have fled terror and tyranny and are some of the most vulnerable among those affected by conflict in Syria. They will now travel to a number of communities across Scotland. The offers of support from ordinary people across Scotland who want to help alleviate the suffering of the vulnerable people caught up in this humanitarian emergency has been overwhelming."" The Scottish Refugee Council said that it had received nearly 2,000 offers of help from individuals offering to assist the refugees. At Holyrood, the first minister attempted to allay any fears over the newcomers. Scotland's response to the atrocities in Paris must be ""one of defiance and solidarity not of fear and division"", Nicola Sturgeon said, amid reports that some Muslims in the country had suffered abuse. Speaking as the Scottish parliament backed a motion of condolence, Ms Sturgeon said: ""The actions of a few must not be allowed to undermine the values and freedoms and way of life of the many. ""Today, Scotland is welcoming refugees from Syria. Other parts of the UK will do likewise over the next few days and weeks. She added:""Let me be clear, people across Scotland and the UK have every right to seek and receive assurances from their governments that robust security checks are being carried out and that public safety is not being compromised. ""Here in Scotland, and across the UK, I think we should also feel proud that we are providing refuge for some of the most vulnerable individuals who are fleeing to safety from the type of people who carried out the attacks in Paris on Friday night."" Ms Sturgeon said that she wanted to reassure Scots that they could go about their day-to-day business safely. ""The overall threat level in the UK is categorised as 'severe'. However, people in Scotland are safe to go about their day-to-day business and they should continue to do so. Police Scotland advise people to be vigilant and alert, but not alarmed,"" she said. The first minister was speaking as Emeline Javierre, the deputy consul of France, representatives of the French community and parliamentary staff of French origin watched from the public gallery. They also heard Kezia Dugdale call for the refugees arriving in Scotland to be welcomed with open arms. ""Let's look at them like we do those Parisians who fled the violence on Friday. People, like you and I, who don't want to live in fear of constant violence,"" the Scottish Labour leader said. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, said the response to the attacks must be ""to show that all of us, Muslim and non-Muslim, secular or religious, stand resolute in exposing this poisonous ideology for what it is - a sham cult preying on the immature young"". ""We must confront all those who seek to embed its poison in our society,"" she said. ""We must encourage moderate Muslim voices in Scotland and abroad to show the world that it is not these extremists who have ownership of their faith, but them."" Q&A How many Syrian refugees are coming? The UK government is committed to resettling 20,000 Syrians from refugee camps in the Middle East, with 1,000 planned between now and Christmas. A total of 2,000 refugees will be housed in Scotland. Why are some people concerned? Ahmad al-Mohammad, 25, was one of the suicide bombers who murdered hostages in the Bataclan concert hall. He reportedly came into Europe posing as a Syrian refugee via the Greek island of Lesbos. Are these people genuine refugees? Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that all those coming to the UK are part of the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme and have undergone ""stringent security checks"". Theresa May, the UK home secretary, has also insisted refugees will be thoroughly vetted to ensure that they do not pose a terrorist threat. Why are they coming here? They have been forcibly displaced from their homeland by war. Where will they live? Five Scottish local authorities have agreed to take part in the scheme - Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire and Argyll and Bute, where 15 families will be rehoused in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. How long will they stay for? They will be granted humanitarian protection for five years. This includes access to public funds, education, health care and the labour market, and the possibility of family reunion if they were split up from their partner or child when leaving.

What Crisis?; After the rhetoric about an existential challenge to Europe, a lack of urgency on the ground threatens to derail efforts to persuade Syria's refugees to stay in Turkey","Seventeen days ago EU officials agreed a deal with Turkey to reverse the flow of refugees from Syria to Greece and in the process save a system of free movement within Europe that was already on its knees. Implementing that deal, the head of the European Commission said, would be ""the biggest challenge the EU has ever faced"". So far Europe has not risen to it. The return of refugees who have reached Greece since March 20 is supposed to begin today. Turkey's government has said that it is ready to receive 500 deportees at once and hundreds more each day this week, but there is little sign of the facilities they will need, either in the coastal resorts from which they began their journey to Europe or farther inland. On the Greek side observers estimated with 24 hours to go that half the EU officials needed to make a reality of mass deportation were in place. Frontex, the European border agency, had hired only two leisure vessels for this historic operation, with scant help from a United Nations which considers the whole process illegal. Even if it turns the tide bound for Kos and Lesbos, there is nothing to suggest that hundreds of thousands left homeless by the war in Syria will not simply seek other routes to Europe, as they did last year. Germany's interior minister said yesterday ""with a great deal of caution"" that the peak of the refugee crisis was past. More caution is needed. It is true that numbers of migrants entering Germany from Austria, and Greece from Turkey, have fallen sharply in recent weeks. Austria's closure of its eastern borders to irregular migrants, together with the EU-Turkey deal, sent a signal of deterrence to those contemplating the westward trip. Even if only a token number of refugees are returned to Turkey this week they will underline that signal. But to achieve more than symbolic impact the (EURO)3 billion accord between Ankara and Brussels requires more than a transfer of funds. It will take a massive and sustained commitment from European as well as Turkish officials, and unprecedented co-operation between them. There is not much sign of either. There are already 2.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. Most are living not in camps but in rented accommodation without work permits and with rapidly dwindling savings. To return home is impossible for those whose homes are destroyed and life-threatening for all. To accept their fate in Turkey is, for many, to accept destitution. That is why hoping that the peak of the crisis is past does not make it so. Hundreds of the most recent arrivals in Lesbos have responded to the closure of last year's route through the western Balkans by applying for asylum in Greece, ruling out summary deportation. Many of those turned back will pause for breath then set out for Europe again, via a different entry point. The most obvious is Lampedusa, reached via Libya, where the EU's high representative for foreign affairs estimates that nearly half a million people are ready to risk the crossing despite last year's harrowing loss of life in unseaworthy smugglers' boats. The likelihood of a renewed focus on north African routes has prompted suggestions of more deals, starting with one between Brussels and Libya. Whether such a deal could stick when power in Tripoli is contested between two rival prime ministers and the speaker of the parliament is questionable at best. Anticipating the worst, Austria has sent border guards to the Brenner Pass. The EU is learning that it is not enough to close borders and write large cheques to neighbouring countries. A comprehensive response to this crisis will be elusive without peace in Syria. In the meantime Turkey must do more to uphold its side of the deal with Europe, but if that deal collapses Europe's lack of urgency over the past fortnight will be seen, rightly, as a tragic missed opportunity.",Broadsheet,1,2016-04,0,Policy
4826,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,23/9/2015,522 words,Jill Sherman,Town halls fear huge bills as refugees arrive,"Correction: The Local Government Association states that it is not ""preventing"" refugees from travelling to England, as we said (News, Sept 23); councils are seeking clarification from the government of the workings of the new resettlement scheme. We are happy to make this clear. A group of Syrian refugees arrived in England yesterday, the first since David Cameron pledged to help 20,000 of those who have escaped to camps in the Middle East Local councils are preventing many more from travelling pending the outcome of negotiations with the Home Office over funding. The Home Office said yesterday that ""a number of people"" had arrived as part of the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme for Syrian refugees. A spokesman refused to say where they would live, but they are believed to be families or individuals who have been expected for some time as part of an earlier scheme. Local government sources said that they had been negotiating with the Home Office for weeks about how to accommodate the influx and how they would be funded. Mr Cameron said that funding would be diverted from the overseas aid budget for a year, yet councils are expected to provide housing, health and education services for up to five years, and for families with children this could be much longer. The costs are considerably higher for large families or for individuals who are injured or traumatised. David Simmonds, the chairman of the Local Government Association's asylum, migration and refugee task force, said that councils were coming forward with offers to help but were continuing to press the government on how the scheme would operate. ""We need to know who is arriving and when in order to ensure that we have the right homes, school places and other support that may be required,"" Mr Simmonds said. ""There are a num-ber of issues that need to be urgently resolved, in particular the need for a firm commitment that councils resettling refugees will receive full financial support, in order that it is not seen later as an unfair burden on communities that open their doors."" He said that it had been heart-warming to see how many people were offering to take vulnerable refugees into their homes. However, the government had confirmed that people would not be able to put up refugees in spare rooms. Mr Simmonds said: ""I have been speaking to Richard Harrington, the minister in charge of the refugee process, but there are some sticky questions round funding,"" he said. ""We have been offered one year so far, but under OECD rules we cannot get more than one year. We are looking to see if we can get round that."" Mr Simmonds said that it was also vital for councils to know how severely injured the refugees were. ""From the profiles we have seen from the UNHCR [refugee agency] they are more injured than we imagined,"" he said. ""Many will need a lot of health and social care. One man was blinded in a gas attack and he is coming with his family. Many of the families are much larger than we anticipated."" The Home Office said: ""We are working closely with the UNHCR and local authorities to make sure we are ready to welcome more Syrians.""",Broadsheet,1,2015-09,0,Policy
4959,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,7/9/2015,1045 words,NA,"How to help families in their time of need; With millions of Syrians driven out of their homes, refugee charities urgently need cash and volunteers","The brutal conflict in Syria has driven millions out of their homes and thousands of families into Europe. These refugees need urgent aid to survive in makeshift camps and on long journeys, but will also need support here if Britain gives sanctuary. The UK has a long history of helping those driven out of their homes by war, oppression and persecution. However, many schemes providing aid to refugees are run on a local level by councils or by small charities that rely on public donations and volunteer support. Public sympathy for the Syrian refugees has been building in recent weeks and was galvanised by images of Aylan Kurdi, three, who was found drowned in Turkey. Readers of The Times have written to express their desire to help. If you have felt moved to provide support, here is a guide to how you can donate money or goods, volunteer your time, or offer shelter. MONEY Cash donations are the most effective way to help major aid charities. Save the Children estimates that more than 350,000 have made the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean, with 26,000 children arriving alone in Europe. Their child refugee crisis appeal is asking for donations, and £80 can give shelter for a family of five. www.savethechildren.org.uk/guardian Red Cross has workers across the Continent trying to provide food, water, medicine, nappies and hygiene kits to thousands on the move. www.redcross.org .uk/refugeeappeal Migrant Offshore Aid Station, a charity based in Malta, operates three boats and two drone aircraft to locate vessels in distress in the Mediterranean and help those loaded on to boats by criminal gangs. moas.eu/donate Refugee Action is one of the smaller charities providing support to asylum seekers in the UK. They help newly arrived refugees to get accommodation and legal advice, settle and integrate; www.refugee-action.org.uk/support_us/give The website JustGiving has collated a series of appeals from individuals looking to provide support to those in the Calais camp. www.about.Justgiving.com/content/calais-migrant-crisis GOODS Major aid agencies prefer cash donations and the Red Cross has said that anyone with items to donate can leave them with charity shops to be sold to raise funds. CalAid is group of volunteers taking aid to refugee camps in Calais. They need men's shoes and hiking boots, tents, jackets, socks, candles and belts; they do not want women's or children's clothes or footwear. www.calaid.co.uk A number of Facebook pages are directing people to local dropoff points and volunteer groups gathering items to send to Calais or to refugees in eastern Europe and Greece. www.facebook.com/groups/ CALAISMIGRANTSOLIDARITY-ACTIONFROMUK A host of other groups are looking for items: Music Against Borders wants musical instruments; the Jungle Library wants books for its makeshift library in the Calais camp; Refugee Action wants old cars; and Recycle4Charity takes old printer cartridges and mobile phones. TIME Most charities that deal with refugees welcome volunteers willing to give up a few hours an evening or a day or two a week to help people to settle in and advise on accessing local services and legal help. Red Cross has vacancies for caseworker volunteers to help asylum seekers and refugees to access NHS and social services and legal representation. It is also recruiting volunteers to help with basics such as clothing and settling into a local area and is seeking interpreters to help new arrivals. www.redcross.org.uk/ get-involved/volunteer/ refugee-support The Refugee Support Network is recruiting educational mentors to work with child refugees. Volunteers are subject to police checks and are given training sessions before being asked to give up one hour per week. A spokeswoman said: ""We aren't asking people to be counsellors or social workers - we step in to provide specialist support - but it can be as simple as helping them learn to read and write or get the confidence to go into a shop to ask for something."" At present the scheme operates in London only, but donations of £40,000 would fund a project in a new city for a year. www.refugeesupportnetwork.org/ Jobs-volunteering Zoe Grumbridge of Refugee Action said: ""We are totally reliant on volunteers. Having a regular commitment is really important. We have a variety of roles: a team at the airport to meet people when they arrive; people to show them how central heating works or help them adapt to a community, help them integrate, understand where their GP is, how to enrol kids in schools, teach them what things cost etc."" www.refugee-action.org.uk/ support_us/volunteer SHELTER Opening your home to refugee families or children, whether in the short or long term, is a serious commitment. It must be co-ordinated through official channels and will often require training and support from professionals, who will need to carry out safeguarding checks. Many of those arriving in the UK will have experienced severe trauma and will need intensive emotional and medical www.support.No Accommodation Network runs hosting projects where people can offer spare bedrooms and shelter for refugees. Dave Smith, its founder, said: ""If there are people who have got spare rooms that they would be willing to open up to refugees who are already here, then we would be delighted to hear from them. There are hosting projects in various parts of the country. Some people may want to host Syrian refugees coming in directly and then they would have to get in touch with their local council."" www.naccom.org.uk/agencies/all Save the Children has called for a UK-wide system to register people who want to foster an unaccompanied child. A spokeswoman said: ""This [system] would be organised by central government. What we can help with is [to make sure] all those families prepared to foster understand what they will be taking on and how to support them with children who have been tortured and seen war."" David Simmonds of the Local Government Association said: ""We need to make sure this is properly led. If you feel you want to help by providing accommodation, contact your local authority.""

5051,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,16/7/2016,563 words,NA,Give Smart; Priti Patel has a chance to end wasteful targets in British overseas aid,"Priti Patel, the new secretary of state for international development, has been put in charge of a government department that three years ago she said should be dismantled. There is no reason to believe she has changed her mind; nor should she. The Department for International Development (DfID) should be a champion of state-ofthe-art overseas aid and a symbol of British soft power. Instead it has become a byword for mismanagement and waste. Thanks to the government's statutory duty to devote 0.7 per cent of GDP to foreign aid, one of the department's principle duties is spending taxpayers' money to ensure that the target is met. This is a target embraced to alleviate suffering, serve Britain's strategic interests and in the process give the country a good name. In practice it has served to profit corrupt regimes and given aid a bad name. Ms Patel urged the government in 2013 to consider replacing DfID with a department for international trade and development that would prioritise trade over aid in line with much expert advice on development economics. If she has the time and energy the secretary of state should advocate merging DfID with the new department for international trade. Her more urgent task is to get the 0.7 per cent target scrapped in favour of an overseas aid regime that spends less money more effectively and where it is needed most. This will require legislation, since the target was enshrined in law last year. All three main parties supported the move, but that does not make it right. Britain is a generous country, at the forefront of overseas aid through charities and the work of the British Council. Britain has given more to the relief of Syrian refugees since 2011 than any other country except the United States. The 0.7 per cent target was established 46 years ago by the United Nations but Britain is one of only six countries to meet it consistently. Germany devotes 0.4 per cent of GDP to aid, France 0.37 and the US 0.2. As the British economy has grown, so has the amount of aid money chasing projects. Some of these are easy to caricature. Directly or through EU grants, British taxpayers have funded juggling lessons in Tanzania, plastic bag art, an American think tank, a Zimbabwean pavilion at the Venice Biennale and a project to help Madagascan fish find mates. More troubling are larger-scale commitments imperfectly audited for effectiveness or corruption, such as the £285 million spent on an airport for the remote island of St Helena that may never be used due to strong winds. Or the £400 million sent to Montserrat despite ""abundant"" warnings of bribery and nepotism. British aid spending has doubled to £12.1 billion since 2008. In that time taxpayers have struggled with austerity and many Whitehall departments have absorbed cuts of up to 40 per cent. DfID's defenders insist that most of its budget is well spent, yet nothing is more guaranteed to undermine public support for overseas aid than the share that is obviously wasted. Now, more than ever, constructive British engagement with the wider world is vital. Ms Patel has vowed to ""invest UK aid firmly in our national interest"". It makes sense to define that interest broadly, especially in the effort to stem the flow of migrants towards Europe from the world's poorest countries. Locking ourselves into an aid system that demands waste makes no sense at all.",Broadsheet,1,2016-07,0,Policy
4918,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,8/1/2016,379 words,Hannah Lucinda Smith,"Police seize 1,250 fake LIFEJACKETS on refugee route","Police have raided a factory in Turkey that was manufacturing fake lifejackets to sell to refugees. Officers discovered 1,263 lifejackets stuffed with non-buoyant material and branded ""Yamaxa"" in an apparent attempt to make them look like the genuine Yamaha brand. Two Syrian children were working in the factory in the resort of Izmir, on the Aegean coast. The raid came a day after the bodies of 34 refugees, seven of them children, washed up on the Turkish coast in the early hours of Tuesday. Their rubber boats had overturned soon after setting off. Many of the bodies were photographed still wearing their lifejackets, leading to speculation that they had been sold fake and ineffective models. Lifejackets can be found on sale in army surplus stores, convenience shops and even kebab restaurants in areas of Turkey where refugees congregate. They can be bought for as little as 50 Turkish lira (£11), but are useless as buoyancy aids. Most will absorb water and make it more difficult to stay afloat. ""I've seen washed-up lifejackets filled with stuff that looks like grass,"" Ann Davidson, a British expat who lives in the people-smuggling hub of Turgutreis, told The Times. ""They are selling them in the Sunday flea-market here."" Meanwhile, Wings of Lebanon, an airline that flies from Beirut to the Turkish coastal city of Adana, has started asking its customers not to steal the lifejackets. The airline launched in 2012 serving only the one route, initially for Syrian refugees, aid workers and diplomats travelling between the two major refugee-hosting countries. Over the past year, however, many of its passengers have been migrants and refugees travelling to Turkey to start illicit journeys to Europe. Huge piles of abandoned lifejackets litter the beaches of Greek islands such as Lesbos and Chios, which sit within striking distance of the Turkish coast and have become the landing points for over a million migrants in the past year. About 2,000 people are still attempting the sea journey each day. From today, Syrians will require visas to enter Turkey, for the first time in six years. The country's foreign minister said that the move aimed to tackle the number of migrants, many using fake Syrian passports, who enter in order to travel to Europe illegally.",Broadsheet,1,2016-01,0,Conditions
5002,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,29/4/2016,517 words,NA,"Lords force rethink on Britain taking in 3,000 child refugees","Ministers are looking again at whether Britain should offer sanctuary to 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees from Europe, in the face of mounting parliamentary pressure. The government is being forced to look at compromising after the Democratic Unionist party signalled that it would switch sides and back the plans by the Labour peer Lord Dubs, who fled the Holocaust as a refugee in the 1930s. On Monday ministers defeated attempts to force Britain to take children from elsewhere in Europe by 18 votes, prompting cries of ""shame"" from opposition MPs, but the issue will return to the House of Commons after the local elections following a rebellion in the Lords. The eight DUP MPs abstained during the critical amendment in the passage of the Immigration Bill. The number of Conservative rebels is likely to rise above five, with several of the 35 MPs who abstained now hardening their position. This is set to wipe out the government majority at a time when Downing Street is desperate to avoid contentious issues on the floor of the Commons. The new plans will be announced by May 9 at the latest, the first week after the local elections. It will mark an embarrassing U-turn for Downing Street and the Home Office. They have argued that taking in children from Europe would encourage others to put their lives at risk with people traffickers and on perilous sea crossings. David Cameron has repeatedly warned that helping refugees who have already reached Europe would encourage more to follow. This month he pledged to take in 3,000 more child refugees from war zones in Africa and the Middle East to stave off a revolt. It comes on top of a commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in Britain by 2020. The government attempted to kill off the proposals by certifying that the measure was ""engaging financial privilege"", meaning that the Lords have no choice but to back down after it was rejected by the Commons. The Lords responded on Tuesday night by rebuffing MPs, re-inserting - with a majority of more than 100 - the demand for Britain to take unaccompanied children fleeing war zones. They removed the specific number of refugees in the legislation to stop the government invoking financial privilege. Lord Dubs has led the calls in the Lords for the change, having come to Britain on the ""Kindertransport"" for Jewish children fleeing Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia before the Second World War. He said this week that the present Conservative government would ""have probably said no"" to taking in children fleeing the Nazis.

No I will not. Some lazy a****s think that remembering to carry a plastic bag is simply too big an ask. ""It's pretty disgusting,"" said one Grimsby shopper vox-popped this week. ""It's something extra to worry about when you're shopping."" Yeah, take that, Syrian refugees. It isn't that I don't agree with penalising them, because I do. Even though that forgetful lazy a*** is sometimes me. But there are so many other packaging atrocities that should be pulled out of class and shamed like a flatulent schoolboy yet never are. Take the craze for gift bags. Once you wrapped a present in nice paper and Sellotape. Not now. Are you mad? Each gift, however trifling, must be enveloped in tissue paper and placed in a shiny, beribboned presentation bag festooned with glitter and angels' tears. At children's parties I see trampled hillocks of them, costing up to a fiver a time, being shovelled into the refuse, their lifespan shorter than a mayfly's. Each could probably make 100 plastic carriers. Then there's Amazon, which sends things in boxes 20 times bigger than the item you ordered and fills the space with hundreds of polystyrene hell-peanuts. And what of toothbrushes in their impenetrable moulded suits of armour, which must require a rainforest-sized landfill hole of their own? Are toothbrushes so dangerous they require this level of security? Ditto toys, staring from their thick, plastic bubbles affixed to cardboard by 50 twisty ties. And Easter eggs in which the fancy cardboard exceeds by 100 times the sliver of chocolate within, and is a one-fingered salute to the environment. We hardly need mention the waste festival that is a Happy Meal or that supermarkets take a food item, say half a cucumber, shrink-wrap it then put that in another plastic sheath as if it's some kind of toxic penis. And men's shirts - what's that about? Buy a suit shirt in Cellophane and behold a nest of cardboard cuff-protectors, a plastic collar-shaper, clips, pins. Who knows if you will have to pay 5p to carry that little lot home, because the government has made the new carrier-bag rules as complex as possible. For instance, small corner shops are exempt from charging 5p, although many say they will. Supermarkets don't have to charge for bags used for unwrapped food or razor blades, but they do for a few tins of www.beans.No charge if you buy some loose flowers or a live aquatic creature, but yes if you buy some bananas. Hit us in the pocket by all means for the 7.6 billion bags given away last year, most of which are probably now choking a turtle, but don't forget all the other packaging horrors. And at least make the rules clear and the charge meaningful. Five pence is nothing when people gladly spent six times that on a birthday presentation bag that will be trampled under a toddler's foot. Make it 20p per carrier and I fancy all our memories will start improving. But first can we start fining supermarkets for every cucumber wearing a double condom?

A Syrian shepherd and a boy aged seven died as they trekked through the mountains from Syria to Lebanon. Aid organisations warned that the lives of many more refugees were in danger, with the extreme conditions expected to last well into the weekend, cutting off many supply routes. Deep snow closed roads leading to Lebanon's Bekaa valley, preventing aid workers from reaching refugees. Mobile phone photographs sent to the Norwegian Refugee Council by refugees in the valley showed people shivering in a knee-deep snowfall. The UN refugee agency said that conditions were worst in Lebanon because of the lack of formal refugee camps, leaving refugees living in scattered communities dotted across the country. Lebanon is host to half of the estimated 3.2 million Syrian refugees who have fled to neighbouring countries to escape the conflict. A further 7.6 million are internally displaced, many out of the reach of aid organisations. Snow was forecast to fall as far south as Saudi Arabia. Gales, heavy rain and giant hail caused chaos in coastal cities from Alexandria to Beirut. In Syria there was, at least, relief from the guns, which fell silent as snow in Damascus grounded the regime aircraft that have pounded civilian neighbourhoods with barrel bombs. The Palestinian authorities declared a state of emergency in response to the storm while Jordan, also blanketed in snow, sent snow ploughs into the West Bank to assist.

5186,src_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,12/7/2017,947 words,Roger Boyes,"Hungary was right about the migrant crisis; Europeans are adopting the idea that nation states, not the EU, must deal with immigration","There's a German word for it: Weltschmerz, the thud of anxiety that comes from living through, or alongside global upheaval. Brexit, Trump, serial terror attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire, we have all been touched by it, the galloping migraine-inducing pace of events. Imagine, then, what it feels like to live on the Italian island of Lampedusa, to have welcomed with aching hearts the thousands of refugees who washed up on its shores after the 2011 Arab uprisings, and to have shared the meagre infrastructure, so poor that pregnant locals have to take the long ferry ride to Sicily for a check-up. Then to be abandoned by the European Union and the Italian government, as the Mediterranean route became the chief entry path into the Continent for the desperate of sub-Saharan Africa. Now the Lampedusans have turfed out their mayor Giusi Nicolini who, decked with international prizes, had joined Angela Merkel as the champion of an open, liberal Europe. The locals want a mayor who will say to the world that the island can no longer cope; that Merkel's ""welcome culture"" no longer works for them. This is pretty much the story of the south and east of Europe. Their difficulty with strained infrastructure, once so acute that populist parties made political capital everywhere, was never really addressed. Central government's priority in 2015 was to provide a sticking plaster and it was left to local hosts to struggle on as best they could. Now the migrant numbers are rising fast again. Last year 181,436 migrants took the central Mediterranean route, up 18 per cent on the epic figures of 2015. This year is shaping up to be just as high. It has been two years since Merkel announced her Willkommenskultur and Europe is still groping around for a solution. Centrist parties, in the absence of a coherent multinational policy, are adopting the tough lines once advocated by the pariah parties of the far right. Germany recently tightened its deportation laws - rejected asylum-seekers can now be detained and electronically tagged long before their official deportation date to prevent them slipping the net. Personal data can be trawled from the mobile phones of refugees. Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian foreign minister, said earlier this month that his country should be ready to send troops to the Brenner Pass if it seemed that multitudes of migrants were about to come over from Italy. In Denmark, the centre-left Social Democrats have been making overtures to the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party. The Social Democrats even backed the (rarely used) jewellery law, whereby police were allowed to seize the jewellery of immigrants to pay for their stay. Suddenly, it seems as if the Hungarian model for dealing with immigration - widely condemned as a violation of civilised European values - was ahead of its time. Some 400,000 migrants travelled through the Balkans and across the Serbian border into Hungary in 2015. They were on their way westwards, drawn by Angela Merkel's offer of an open Germany, and very quickly Hungary felt overwhelmed. Tough police units were filmed beating back the foreigners and Hungary was cast as the ugly face of Europe. Viktor Orban, Hungary's garrulous prime minister, presents himself as the enemy of the EU liberal consensus (though happy to take its subsidies). Sure enough, there are grounds for concern, not least his hateful public campaign against the philanthropist George Soros. It does not bolster confidence when he declares that ""ethnic homogeneity"" is a key to economic success. Yet his reasoning behind the tainted rhetoric does strike a chord with many ordinary Hungarians. ""I do not want to see the country drifting towards a situation where lower-skilled work would only be carried out by foreigners,"" he says. ""We ourselves have to do the work required to keep our economy going, from scrubbing toilets to nuclear science."" Orban's point: if open immigration leads to an underclass of foreigners then it ends up sapping national dignity. His critics say that since he rejects the very idea of a benign multicultural society, he does not even want to make the effort of integrating foreigners or making the economy so porous that immigrants can prosper. It's not so much populism as indifference. The Hungarian prime minister is plainly no saint but he has been right in two important respects. First, Europe really is adrift on immigration. Second, it is ultimately up to nation states to find the correct balance between incomers and residents. Many in the EU are already quietly resigned to the idea that fortification of the external borders is the way to go. ""I would find myself with Sebastian Kurz stating our arguments to a roomful of ministers,"" Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian foreign minister, tells me, ""and I would find the colleagues discreetly texting me: 'Well said!' or 'If only I could have said that!'"" Political correctness is blocking the way to a collective recognition that the principles of asylum have to be rethought, that the bar on allowing refugees to work has to be lifted, that Schengen borders can no longer be as porous as they once were. Hungary doesn't have all the answers but it recognises the migrant crisis is a rolling one. We have to brace for the eventual collapse of the EU-Turkish deal which has kept so many Syrian refugees out of the EU over the past year. And if only a fraction of the climate change predictions are true, much of the world will be trekking towards Europe in a couple of decades. Let's start thinking more clearly about what that means for our frontiers and the way we are going to live our lives.

Most of the attacks occur on the Turkish mainland, where migrants await smugglers who will sneak them across the narrow strait separating the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey. Witnesses, however, have also reported attacks at sea as armed robbers take to the water to plunder the savings and valuables with which Syrian refugees are seeking to start a new life in Europe. ""They know that the Syrians are loaded with money and jewellery,"" Daniel Esdras, of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said. ""They are easy targets. Authorities on both side of the Aegean have to act before this gets ever more violent."" Late on Wednesday IOM crews rescued the latest victims of such an assault from a raft washed up on Lesbos. Three women and one man, all Syrian, were taken to hospital with serious head and chest injuries sustained when they were set upon by armed robbers looking for cash and jewellry. The three women, also accompanied by five children, were each carrying (EURO)10,000, which the robbers seized in addition to their gold necklaces.

The criticism by François Crépeau came as scores of migrants detained at a refugee camp on the island of Lesbos set rubbish bins ablaze, demanding that they be allowed free movement within the country. ""Detention should only be ordered when people present a risk, a danger, a threat to the public and it has to be a documented threat, it can't simply be a hunch,"" said Mr Crépeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Speaking at the end of a five-day visit, he urged the authorities in Greece to provide families with an alternative to detention. Many of the unaccompanied children he met were being held in police stations with no access to the outdoors. Others were being traumatised by distressing living conditions at overcrowded detention centres. ""This all creates an unacceptable level of confusion, frustration, violence and fear,"" he said. About one in four of the million-plus migrants who have come to Europe through Greece are children, according to the UN. ""Children should not be detained. Period,"" Mr Crépeau said. More than 6,600 migrants are being held in Greece as part of a EU deal in which asylum seekers who illegally enter the country are returned to Turkey, and Syrian refugees are then accepted into Europe from Turkish camps.

The report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that aid budgets totalled £92 billion last year, a 6.9 per cent increase on 2014. The increase was higher than expected as £8 billion was spent on coping with a massive surge in refugees. Once this is stripped out, aid spending was up by 1.7 per cent. Money spent either host-ing or processing refugees in donor countries made up 9.1 per cent of aid budgets in 2015, nearly doubling from 4.8 per cent in 2014. Ángel Gurría, secretary-general of the OECD, suggested that most countries had avoided diverting money from development programmes to cover the refugee costs. ""Countries have had to find large sums to cover the costs of a historic refugee crisis in Europe, and most have so far avoided diverting money from development programmes. These efforts must continue. We also welcome that more aid is being provided to the poorest countries,"" Mr Gurría said. ""Governments must ensure that development aid keeps rising. They also need to develop longterm options for meeting future refugee costs and the integration of refugees in our societies."" The report said that a record 1.5 million refugees claimed asylum in OECD countries in 2015 and more than a million of them arrived in Europe.

5070,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,30/8/2014,638 words,Catherine Philp,Half of all Syrians flee for their lives,"The number of Syrians forced from their country by the civil war has surpassed three million, the United Nations refugee agency said yesterday. The crisis, it added, was ""the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era"". At least one million Syrians have fled in the past year alone, the UNHCR said - and the actual figure was likely to be far higher, as the official tally included only those who had registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Inside Syria itself, the picture is grimmer still, with 6.5 million people displaced from their homes by the fighting, often a number of times, as they seek safety within the limited reach of aid agencies. ""Almost half of all Syrians have now been forced to abandon their homes and flee for their lives,"" the agency said in a statement. António Guterres, the UN's high commissioner for refugees, said the crisis was a global challenge to which few nations had responded adequately. ""The world is failing to meet the needs of refugees and the countries hosting them,"" he said. The increasingly fragmented conflict has claimed more than 191,000 lives since it began in March 2011. Syria's neighbours have borne the brunt of an exodus that is not only crippling them financially but also threatening their own stability. Lebanon, with a population of less than five million, has taken in more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees. Jordan has registered 608,000 and Turkey 815,000. Tens of thousands more fled to Iraq over the past three years, only to meet the onslaught of Islamic State (Isis) militants as the group seeks to expand its self-declared caliphate through that country. David Miliband, the former foreign secretary who is president of the International Rescue Committee, said the figures represented ""three million indictments of government brutality, opposition violence and international failure"". He added: ""This appalling milestone needs to generate action as well as anger."" The UN said that the recent surge in fighting had dramatically worsened an already desperate situation, as Isis expanded its control through Syria and Iraq, terrorising rivals and civilians in both countries. Many of the refugees arriving in Jordan come from the northern province of Aleppo, where a three-way fight is under way between the Assad regime, mainstream Syrian rebels and Isis. Others fleeing to safety are from Raqqa, the jihadists' main stronghold in the northeast. A report from an independent UN commission investigating potential war crimes in Syria documented the dramatically deteriorating human rights situation in those areas in particular, placing blame on both regime and opposition forces. Public massacres, beheadings and crucifixions had become a common spectacle in areas under Isis control, the report said, alongside the mass killings of minorities, opponents and rivals. The commission also accused the Syrian government of the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians by barrelbombing urban areas and dropping shells filled with chlorine gas. Many of those arriving in neighbouring countries have already fled multiple times, from place to place within Syria, before finally crossing the border. They are arriving in an increasingly desperate condition, with their savings exhausted and their mental and physical health depleted - placing ever greater strains on the already stretched resources of the host nations. Lebanon suffered a second large incursion by Syrian-based Isis militants this week, prompting the US to send a $20 million (£12 million) cache of arms, including anti-tank missiles and mortar bombs, to bolster the national army. Earlier this month militants seized the town of Arsal on the Syrian border. The threat of the expansion of the Islamic State caliphate from Syria and Iraq has created a common front among Lebanon's normally fractious political forces.",Broadsheet,1,2014-08,0,Migration

In the early hours of yesterday an EU summit rejected proposals, backed by the German chancellor, to double funding for Turkey to (EURO)6 billion and grant 75 million Turks visa-free European travel by the end of June. Any agreement will be delayed until after Sunday's regional elections, in which Mrs Merkel's ruling coalition faces anti-immigrant populists. Putting a brave face on one of her least successful EU summits in five years, marred by divisions and hostility, she said that ""overall things are going in the right direction"". Asked if she and the EU were being blackmailed by Turkey as desperate ministers tried to avoid a rerun of last year's migration crisis, when more than a million migrants flooded into Germany, Mrs Merkel replied: ""No."" ""We are seeking a balance of interests,"" she told the German SWR radio station. ""We have our interests, Turkey have theirs."" Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish prime minister, returned from Brussels in buoyant spirits, boasting of a ""gamechanger"", having extracted concessions from Germany, although the prospects of a deal being agreed at the next summit on March 18 are far from certain. ""Turkey is ready to work with the EU, and Turkey is ready to be a member of the EU as well,"" he said. Mrs Merkel faces criticism from her conservative coalition partners over her handling of the migration crisis and a perception that she is giving too much to Turkey, including compromises on human rights. ""We mustn't put ourselves in the hands of the Turks,"" said Hans-Peter Friedrich, the former German interior minister and a Bavarian conservative. Mrs Merkel is under pressure from the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in regional elections in Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt at the weekend. AfD has criticised the talks with Turkey, particularly the idea of giving visa-free travel to Turks within the borderless Schengen travel zone. In return Turkey will try to stop migrants crossing the Aegean Sea to Greece. ""Using Turkey as a highly paid bouncer has several dangerous pitfalls,"" Armin-Paul Hampel, an AfD leader and former journalist, said. Already facing criticism from within Germany, Mrs Merkel's agreement has divided EU governments and provoked criticism from the United Nations refugee agency. ""I am deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards,"" Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees told MEPs. During Monday's summit Mrs Merkel made a serious miscalculation by trying to force EU leaders to go further than had been agreed by diplomats. France, her key ally, was angered as were Cyprus, Hungary, Poland, Luxembourg and Austria. EU leaders did manage, after negotiations that overran by over ten hours, to agree the ""basis of principles"" for a deal at a summit on March 18, but important difficulties and political conflicts remain. Key to the agreement is a plan ""to return all new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey into the Greek islands with the costs covered by the EU"". This deportation measure would apply to everyone, including Syrians, who was intercepted in Turkish waters. A combined Nato and EU operation working with Turkey's coastguard to pick up migrant boats began this week. The UN's refugee agency has criticised the proposal as a breach of humanitarian law because Turkey is not a full member of the Geneva Convention. Only Syrians have the right to claim a reduced form of international protection in Turkey, which falls short of the European asylum model. Iraqis, Afghans or Eritreans sent back do not have refugee rights. ""Sending back people who would not have access to protection in Turkey poses a certain number of problems in terms of international law and European law,"" Vincent Cochetel, director of the European office of the UNHCR, said. There was also agreement in principle to ""additional funding"" which would be another (EURO)3 billion by the end of 2018. It means that Britain's contribution will double from the (EURO)327 million already agreed to (EURO)654 million (£505 million) Agreement must clear hurdles Analysis An EU agreement with Turkey to end the flow of migrants across the Aegean Sea is not a done deal (Bruno Waterfield writes). Angela Merkel miscalculated by trying to bounce other EU leaders into going further than had been agreed by diplomats. Sticking points include: Turning back migrants headed for Greece The statement outlines a plan to return those crossing illegally from Turkey to Greek islands. A combined Nato and EU effort aims to pick up boats making unauthorised Journeys from today. One problem is how to monitor a long coastline and all the coves and inlets of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. Another is that Turkey is not a full member of the Geneva conventions and returning refugees there could breach humanitarian laws. One-for-one resettlement deal Germany pushed for a deal under which for every Syrian readmitted by Turkey another would be accepted into the EU. Similar schemes were abandoned last year amid threats from the likes of Hungary to veto any proposal compelling EU states to accept refugees. Mass deportations from Greece The EU has agreed to help to return ""all irregular migrants"", ie those who are not claiming political asylum, to Turkey. But how do you force people to return? Combined with other measures it would mean sending back 1,800 migrants a day. Visas for Turks EU leaders have agreed to talk about speeding up plans to give 75 million Turks visa-free travel into the Schengen passport-free zone. The EU would have to cut corners to meet a June deadline for this. And every country has a veto. Turkey cannot be given freedom of travel in the zone until it recognises the Cypriot government in the Greek half of the island. This is a red line for Cyprus and France. Faster EU membership talks for Turkey Europe's leaders have agreed to unblock long-stalled EU membership talks. Again, Cyprus is key. Cash EU leaders agreed ""to speed up the disbursement of the initially allocated (EURO)3 billion"", over two years, to help Turkey to absorb Syrian refugees. Additional funding, another (EURO)3 billion by the end of 2018, has also been agreed in principle.
