Palanca in south-east Moldova has a population of 2,000 but is one of the main border crossings for those fleeing the war. Its mayor, Dumitru Cozlovschi, said he was proud of the way his people responded to the sudden influx of evacuees. He said: ""I was not surprised. I knew that Moldovans are kind and helpful in times of need. But I was not sure how many families could actually host somebody."" In the immediate aftermath of Vladimir Putin's onslaught, the free bus system that now ferries people to Romania or larger Moldovan cities had yet to be set up. Some refugees - mostly women and children - crossed the border with no idea what their next step would be. Mr Cozlovschi began calling residents to ask whether they would take people in. Half of the remote village's 250 homes have volunteered. And since the war started 1,000 refugees have been registered as staying in Palanca for at least one or two weeks. Mr Cozlovschi said the true figure is likely to be higher. Around 200 adult refugees and 80 children are still living in Palanca. Among them is Diana Avetisian, 20, who fled Odesa with her boyfriend and his family. They are staying at Casa Veche guesthouse, one of three in the village supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). She said: ""We heard the sound of bombing and decided to pack our stuff and get out."" Diana's boyfriend Roman Riabykh, 25, crossed the border just an hour before men aged 18 to 60 were banned from leaving Ukraine. They were with his mum Marina Vinogridova, 44, and brother Hleb, nine.

The minister said Government must increase homes being built and cut the legal entry of people. This comes after net migration has hit new records. More than a million people came to Britain to live in the past year as the Government faces political pressure to reduce arrivals. Asked if the UK did not have the number of homes to match the demand from immigrants, the Housing Secretary told Times Radio: ""Migratory flows put more pressure on housing but we haven't built enough homes overall for generations. ""This Government is going to hit its target of a million new homes in this Parliament but we do need to go further. This year, I outlined a long-term plan for housing, which will allow us to build more homes, particularly making effective use of brownfield land."" With net migration of 745,000 last year, the Government would need to massively increase housebuilding and significantly reduce immigration to meet the challenge, he said. Mr Gove added: ""It's important when looking at the migration figures to recognise some of these figures are students, some are Ukrainian refugees, some are British nationals from Hong Kong. ""But we need to bring migration down. And we need to build more homes.""

108,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,13/3/2022,556 words,Glen Owen,'Ultimate payback for Putin's cronies'; But Cabinet splits over Gove plan to house refugees in oligarch mansions,"WHEN Michael Gove launched into some of his typically rousing rhetoric at Cabinet last month, calling passionately for the mansions of Russian oligarchs to be seized and opened up to Ukrainian refugees, Boris Johnson murmured his assent. But a fortnight later, the Levelling Up Secretary is still fighting to overcome resistance to his idea from the Treasury and Foreign Office, where officials shiver at what one source dismissed as 'banana republic politics'. For their part, supporters of Mr Gove's plan describe the opponents as 'oligarch apologists'. The debate flared up again last week at the first meeting of a Cabinet sub-committee on Ukraine, chaired by Downing Street's chief of staff Steve Barclay, which has been tasked with examining 'every facet' of the UK's refugee response. When Mr Gove highlighted the powerful symbolism of his proposed move, Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly and Treasury Minister John Glen voiced their departments' reservations. Under Mr Gove's plan, British property owned by oligarchs sanctioned because of the war would be taken over by the Government for as long as they remained on the list, allowing Ministers to throw open their doors to refugees. In the case of Roman Abramovich, Britain's most high-profile oligarch, that would release at least 70 properties, worth around £500million, The portfolio includes a 15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens with an estimated value of £150 million, and a three-storey penthouse in the Chelsea Waterfront tower, bought for £30million in 2018. Abramovich had his assets - including Chelsea FC - frozen on Thursday as part of Government sanctions. Another sanctioned oligarch, aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska, worth £2 billion, owns a £50million property on Belgrave Square in Central London, via a company registered in the British Virgin Islands, and Hamstone House on the exclusive St George's Hill estate near Weybridge, Surrey. The eight-bedroom mansion includes a swimming pool, sauna, gym and extensive gardens. Mr Gove's plan echoes moves by the US Congress to seize assets from oligarchs whose wealth is linked to Vladimir Putin. Under a bill introduced earlier this month, American authorities would be allowed to go further than Mr Gove's plan by confiscating, rather than just seizing, any property - including luxury villas, yachts, and airplanes - valued more than $5million with the funds used to benefit the Ukrainian people via military or humanitarian aid. Supporters of Mr Gove's plan also point the finger at No10's new head of policy, Andrew Griffith, for trying to block it. Mr Griffith, the Arundel MP, is a former Rothschild banker and chief financial officer for Sky TV, who is understood to have argued that the idea is not 'legally workable'. An opponent of the Gove plan said: 'This is gesture politics more suited to a banana republic'. But a supporter said: 'The opposition is being led by oligarch apologists who hide behind the rule of law. These people have been sanctioned for a reason, and no one who has been placed on the sanctions list has ever come off it. This is the ultimate symbolic payback for Putin's cronies.' Downing Street declined to comment and a spokesman for Mr Gove said: 'We don't comment on private Cabinet discussions.'

Enter your details on the official website, homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk Who can apply? Anyone can volunteer to be a host, but initial sponsors are likely to have connections with specific refugees. How many refugees can I host? That depends on how much space you have. You will be asked how many spare rooms are in your property. What happens next? From later this week, Ukrainian refugees will be able to apply for a UK visa through the Homes for Ukraine scheme. How long can they stay in Britain? A visa allows them to stay for up to three years with the right to work, access the NHS and claim most benefits. Councils will be given a grant of £10,500 per refugee to provide support with extra for the costs of schooling. What must hosts do? They will be expected to accommodate the evacuees for a minimum of six months. Each participating household will be given a £350-a-month thank you' from the Government. Could their benefits or taxes be affected? No. The £350 a month is tax-free.

115,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,10/3/2022,1276 words,"BY DAVID BARRETT, JASON GROVES AND GREGORY KIRBY",VISAS: WHEN WILL PRITI GET A GRIP?,"PRITI Patel is expected to bow to pressure and fix the shambolic refugee scheme amid reports that the Prime Minister is losing faith in her handling of the crisis. Scores of Ukrainian evacuees expressed their frustration at British red tape yesterday, including some sent to a Home Office centre in Lviv in the war-torn country that had shut down days earlier. It was announced last night that 100 British military personnel in civilian dress are going to Poland to help organise the visa application centre (VAC) in Warsaw. It came as former prime minister David Cameron suggested the UK's programme should be more generous. One option could be allowing Ukrainians into Britain just by showing their passports, he told LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr, adding: Let's find a way to get it done.' The Daily Mail understands the Home Secretary is planning to unveil significant moves to streamline the refugee scheme and open it to all Ukrainians with family in Britain, although she will stop short of dropping visa requirements altogether. New measures will mean Ukrainians already here for work or on other short-term visas will be able to apply for a free three-year visa that will let them to bring relatives here, Home Office sources said. Until now the refugee scheme has been limited to relatives of Ukrainians with permanent rights to be in the UK. In further moves planned by ministers, refugees who have visited Britain in the past five years will be able to re-use biometrics from earlier visa applications. This will aim to reduce bottlenecks at VACs across the continent where refugees must attend appointments to have fingerprints and facial scans taken. The number of refugee visas granted so far reached 957 yesterday as the Education Secretary predicted Britain will end up taking in around 200,000. Nadhim Zahawi, whose family fled Saddam Hussein's Iraq, told The Spectator the Government had struck the right balance because it's right to have some checks as to who we're settling here'. The planned changes to the visa scheme come amid fierce criticism of Britain's existing set-up. A senior Tory source said: Priti Patel's stock is falling fast. People want us to be generous, the Prime Minister is saying he wants to be generous, but reality on the ground is making a mockery of that. The Home Office has to stop looking at this from the point of view of trying to control numbers. The point of controlling our borders is we can choose to be generous when circumstances demand.' Another Whitehall insider said: Priti has not got a grip on this. What we are seeing is the classic Home Office approach of trying to bureaucratise everything and squeeze the numbers, which is the opposite of what the PM is asking for - it's not surprising he's getting frustrated with her.' An ally of Miss Patel acknowledged it was taking time to get the process running smoothly but said it was not fair to blame it all on her'. The source voiced irritation with Michael Gove's Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which has yet to produce details of the new sponsorship route' for refugees. Priti is getting all the flak for refugees, but there is nothing she can do about the sponsorship route until Gove has decided what it is,' the source said. Downing Street insisted yesterday that Boris Johnson still has full faith' in the Home Secretary. Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko also criticised bureaucratic hassles' yesterday, telling the Commons home affairs committee that, for example, biometric checks should be dropped for child evacuees. A pop up' VAC will open in Lille, France, today but will only deal with applicants referred by Border Force officers at Calais, where hundreds of Ukrainian refugees have already turned up. Other applicants are being urged to go to other centres across Europe. But a British-Ukrainian sales manager Vitalii Morgun, 36, who drove to the Hungarian border with Ukraine to collect family who had fled, said that when they reached the Brussels VAC he was shocked to find just two officials on duty. It's a joke… it's hopeless,' he said. And a British citizen, Joe from Hampshire, who flew to Poland to help get his mother and niece to the UK, said the Home Office told him to apply for visas in Lviv - even though the centre has shut. He told The Daily Telegraph: Basically the Home Office staff don't have the same information as the people do on the ground.' Enver Solomon, of the Refugee Council charity, told MPs the Government was placing paperwork over people'. Comment - Page 20   WE DROVE 1,600 MILES... THEN UK TURNED US AWAY A UKRAINIAN mother and daughter who drove 1,600miles from Kyiv were turned away in Calais by UK border staff who shrugged' as they pleaded to be let through as refugees. Alena Semenova, 22, and Tetyana Tsybanyuk, 40, had bought a ticket on an Irish Ferries sailing to Dover and had passed the French border, but were stopped by seemingly indifferent British officials who detained them like criminals' because they did not have visas. Miss Semenova, a former medical student trying to reach her godparents in Glasbury, Powys, said: We did not understand what was happening, why we were detained as criminals. But the border guard officer shrugged her shoulders and said that they would not let us through without a visa.' They then had to drive 180 miles to Paris where they are hoping to gain visas. But this will only happen if the Government eases restrictions for Ukrainians without relatives in Britain. Her godfather, Graham Blackledge, a chiropodist whose wife Alla is also from Kyiv, said: Let them come over, house them, feed them, look after them. And then if you want to start processing them, but in the first instance help. And to accuse those seeking sanctuary in Britain of perhaps being Russian spies trying to infiltrate the UK, you should be ashamed of yourself.' At the Polish processing centre, Natalia Honcharyk, a 28-year-old marketing executive from Kyiv, said: It's not like we are going on holiday. We only want to get to Britain to seek safety there.' She and her 37-year-old sister, Viktoriia Kudlysheva, a civil servant, hope to stay with a cousin in Bristol. We are unsure if our application will be accepted here because we had originally booked an appointment in Lviv,' Viktoriia said.   THE TORTUOUS PROCESS FOR GAINING ENTRY Ukrainian refugees hoping to come to the UK must go through the following painstaking process under the Government's Family Visa Scheme: Create an online account on the Home Office website and fill in a detailed application form. Upload proof their qualifying family member has permanent residence status in Britain, such as a copy of the Home Office vignette in their family member's passport. Upload proof they had been living in Ukraine before January 1 this year. Provide evidence they are related to the qualifying family member in Britain, such as birth certificates or marriage certificates. If documents cannot be provided, applicants must explain why you are unable to do so'. Translate all above documents into English and upload them to the website. Book and attend an in-person appointment at a Home Office visa application centre in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova or France so officials can take biometrics - fingerprints and a facial scan. The booking system frequently crashes and there are reports the earliest slots available are in two weeks' time. Although normal visa requirements for a tuberculosis vaccination certificate have been waived, some applicants have mistakenly been asked to provide them.

Margaerita Plotnick was with her mother and teenage cousin when she was approached at a refugee reception centre by the stranger who offered to take her to the US. It was only when the suspicious 25-year-old waitress secretly checked US entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees that she discovered the stranger was lying. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday after travelling to Ireland, Margaerita said: 'I had a lucky escape. I could have been a victim of this predator.' Margaerita was approached at the Medyka crossing after 33 days of Russian bombardment and a shortage of food and water forced her to leave her home in Kharkiv. When she and her family members arrived at the Polish border, they were taken by bus to a sprawling industrial site on the outskirts of Przemysl, which has been converted into a reception centre for refugees. They were excited to be offered accommodation in the Irish city of Limerick after registering. 'We thought we were safe,' she said. But Margaerita was approached by 'George', a 44-year-old Russianspeaker with a US passport who told her he ran an import and export business in America. 'He was wearing a yellow jacket like the other volunteers and he had an official wristband which meant he had been vetted to provide transportation,' said Margaerita. 'He told me he was from the UN.' She said George's initially affable charm changed when she declined his offer. 'We refused but he wouldn't stop asking,' she said.

After widespread criticism of bureaucracy surrounding the UK's response, Lord Harrington said the Government's emergency routes will soon bring in 15,000 evacuees a week. The minister also confirmed that so far only hundreds of Ukrainians have arrived in Britain under the Homes for Ukraine programme. Some visa applicants fleeing the Russian invasion have been waiting weeks for a response. 'I want to get this process down to a reasonable amount of time,' said Lord Harrington. 'I am happy to say publicly that my target is 48 hours from when they download the appli- cation form to when they are given permission to travel.' Last week he told MPs that 'two or three days' would be a 'reasonable' ambition, but did not offer an official target at that stage.

Envelopes enclosing around 70,000 cheques which were sent to the Mail Force appeal are being donated to the Bone Cancer Research Trust (BCRT) so that the stamps can go towards raising funds for its lifesaving research work. Dozens of bags full of envelopes have been delivered to the charity's headquarters in Leeds and volunteers will cut out the stamps, which will be sorted and sold in bulk by weight. The trust receives up to £20 a kilogram by selling the stamps to amateur and professional collectors across the country. Collectors will often buy large bags of stamps to look for certain postmarks. Unusual stamps and ones with slight defects can also be snapped up by collectors to improve their private collections. Envelopes donated for previous Mail Force appeals to raise funds for computers for children and to buy personal protective equipment for frontline health workers were also passed on to the cancer charity. The Ukraine refugee appeal was kick-started with £500,000 from DMGT, the Mail's parent company, at the request of Lord and Lady Rothermere, and has raised more than £11.5million so far. Laura Riach, the cancer charity's head of fundraising and communications, said: 'We would like to thank the Daily Mail for donating their used stamps to the Bone Cancer Research Trust's Stamp Appeal. We will turn these stamps into vital funds for our life-saving work, which will truly make a difference to all those affected by primary bone cancer. Last year our Stamp Appeal raised an incredible £11,835.' About 560 people are diagnosed with primary bone cancer in the UK every year, with around 355 annual deaths.

Sally Becker, who helped rescue hundreds of people from war-torn Bosnia, has 'grave concerns' for the women and children after their paperwork was rejected by British officials. The 58-year-old said she set off on the mission to save orphaned youngsters and mothers with the full acknowledgement of the British Government last month. She said many of the refugees came from areas where there was fierce fighting. They had made a 22-hour train journey, collecting more children en route who escaped from places like Mariupol, before crossing into Poland. But when they were ready to travel to the UK, Mrs Becker says the Home Office asked for more evi- dence that the Ukrainian government had sanctioned the evacuation. As a result, their flight booked for yesterday had to be cancelled. She now says the group has just days to find a solution or will have 'nowhere to go', adding: 'I'm completely dependent on the British Government to help me bring these children to a safe haven in the UK. 'We've got grandmothers given custody of children because their parents have either been killed or had to fight. We have children who have been deprived of parents since birth. Many are extremely vulnerable and really need help.' Mrs Becker explained how she set off for Dnipro at the end of April. At that point, she claimed there was no problem obtaining permission to bring the children to the UK. She gathered 167 refugees and negotiated safe passage to the Polish border through the Ukrainian government. She said they 'arranged for three carriages to be attached to the train especially for the children'. Mrs Becker said plans are in place to allow the refugees to stay at two hotels on the Wirral, Merseyside, with a six-month stay funded by The Steve Morgan Foundation. It's understood Ukraine's deputy prime minister has written to minister for refugees Lord Harrington confirming they have been aware of her mission since April 22. A Home Office spokesman said last night: 'We can only give permission for an unaccompanied child to travel where we are certain they will have appropriate support and care once they are here. We are speaking to Sally Becker and the authorities in Ukraine to reach a solution.' Graphic   Plea: Sally with orphans in Poland",Tabloid,1,2022-05,1,Aid

The official website was overwhelmed just minutes after its launch - with 1,500 signing up inside an hour. And by 9.30pm last night more than 43,800 individuals and organisations had logged their support on the Homes for Ukraine site. In a further sign of British generosity, donations to the Daily Mail's appeal for Ukraine crisis victims reached an astonishing £7.2million yesterday. The Homes for Ukraine website crashed repeatedly at first but a government spokesman said experts were looking at the issue and were confident it would settle down quickly. We are seeing a high level of traffic to the website thanks to the enormous generosity of the British public,' the spokesman added last night. Communities Secretary Michael Gove launched the new refugee programme by praising the unfailingly compassionate' British people who have voiced their desperation to help Ukrainians fleeing Vladimir Putin's forces. In other developments: * UK defence sources said Putin's invaders could sustain full fighting capacity in Ukraine for only a further ten to 14 days'; * Russian forces let civilians escape the besieged port of Mariupol for the first time - but blocked an aid convoy; * A pregnant woman wounded when Russia attacked a maternity hospital in the city last week died along with her unborn baby; * Russia stepped up its assault on the suburbs of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, with airstrikes on an apartment block leaving one dead and six injured; * A senior Russian official, National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov, admitted the military campaign was struggling to achieve its aims due to Ukrainian resistance; * Moscow confirmed the first death of a spy from its feared military intelligence agency, the GRU, adding to a lengthening list of senior commanders killed; * In a bizarre online message, tech billionaire Elon Musk challenged Putin, a judo black belt, to man-to-man single combat'; * Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab visited the International Criminal Court in The Hague and said Britain was prepared to host convicted Russian war criminals; * Riot police were called in after squatters occupied a London mansion linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska; * Fellow sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich fled Tel Aviv hours after landing from Moscow as Israel warned it would not serve as a route to bypass sanctions'. The Homes for Ukraine programme will allow members of the public to give refugees rent-free rooms in their home for a minimum of six months. In return the Government will pay hosts £350 a month as a tax-free thank you'. Mr Gove also announced that hosts will require only light-touch' vetting, including a criminal records check. He told the Commons: The British people have already opened their hearts in so many ways, I'm hopeful that many will also be ready to open their homes and to help those fleeing persecution find peace, healing and the prospect of a brighter future. The scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home. There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can benefit from this scheme. The scheme will be open to all Ukrainian nationals and residents. They will be able to live and work in the United Kingdom for up to three years. They will have full and unrestricted access to benefits, health care, employment and other support.' Homes for Ukraine will initially allow hosts to sponsor known connections' for a visa to come to the UK. Initially, most refugees are likely to be housed in areas of the country where there are already a significant number of people of Ukrainian ancestry, Mr Gove said. But he added the scheme would rapidly expand to allow charities and faith and community groups to link Britons to the refugees. He admitted the scheme was not perfect' but had been designed to minimise bureaucracy and make the process as straightforward as possible. We don't believe we need to have full Disclosure and Barring Service checks. It is very often the case that very light-touch criminal checks will be sufficient,' Mr Gove told the Commons. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps yesterday confirmed that he would apply to host Ukrainian evacuees in his home. At the weekend Mr Gove also said he intended to take part. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it would be difficult for him to offer the time' to host refugees. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was unlikely to take any Ukrainian refugees into No 10 due to security concerns. Asked about Mr Johnson, who lives in the flat above No 11 Downing Street with his wife Carrie and two of his children, the PM's spokesman said: There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10.' Former health secretary Matt Hancock said he would be very happy to take in a refugee. I've been working with a Ukrainian family who have family relations in my constituency,' he told BBC Radio Suffolk. I'd be very happy to have a Ukrainian family in my home. I'm lucky to be able to do that, and I look forward to participating, whether in this scheme or helping a Ukrainian family through my constituency links.' d.barrett@dailymail.co.uk   © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2022-03,1,Aid
67,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,13/3/2022,306 words,NA,Oligarchs may find democracy can be very ruthless too,"IT IS very important that justice is not just done but very thoroughly seen to be done. This is the basis of the witty and clever plan put forward by the Cabinet Minister Michael Gove. He proposes that the British Government seizes the huge London homes of Russian oligarchs who have been friendly to Vladimir Putin - and uses them to house Ukrainian refugees. The planned takeover would be temporary, for as long as the oligarchs are sanctioned and for as long as those refugees need roofs over their heads. These grotesquely wealthy businessmen have obtained their riches through dubious methods and by prostrating themselves before the despotic power of the Kremlin. They have in almost all cases been careful to stash their wealth out of Putin's reach, in a free law-governed country quite unlike the one where they made their fortunes. Well, now they may find out that democracy can be ruthless too, especially when faced with greed in alliance with www.aggression.No doubt there will be legal problems to surmount. That is quite proper in a law-governed country such as we are - and such as Russia is not. The aim of the scheme is not to expropriate or nationalise these properties. It is to do something practical and just with them, as hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians seek decent shelter, many of them in this country. Imagine for the moment how such a refugee family might feel if, instead of being placed in a bleak hotel or a church hall, they were installed amid the high ceilings and gold-plated bath taps of some Russian plutocrat. And imagine also how the billionaires might feel, to see their palaces handed over to the deserving and suffering victims of a regime they have until now supported. It might cause them to rethink their allegiance. The idea may seem outrageous at first sight but it deserves careful consideration.",Tabloid,1,2022-03,1,Policy

The Angel Inn in Midhurst, West Sussex, was among several buildings engulfed by the early morning blaze. There were no reports of casualties. Resident Hilton Holloway said about 30 people, including children, were evacuated from the hotel. 'There were a number of Ukrainian refugees in the hotel, which had around 15 rooms,' Mr Holloway said. 'I spoke to one young woman who seemed relatively calm.' Another resident, David Behan, said the refugees spent the night in an Indian restaurant before they were transported to a leisure centre, from where they have been re-homed. He added: 'They arrived at Christmas with very little. And what little they had, they've just completely lost, which is desperate.' Midhurst Town Council arranged a donation point nearby for those affected by the fire.

A senior council worker responsible for her local refugee scheme is concerned there will be 'a massive abuse case' due to a lack of safeguarding measures to protect evacuees. The whistleblower said more than one in four of the 40 matches passed from the Home Office to her local authority are between men aged over 50 and women in their twenties or early thirties. Experts have warned the British government visa scheme - in which would-be hosts are matched with Ukrainians seeking refuge - could become 'Tinder for sex traffickers'. One housing charity claimed the scheme was being exploited before it opened, with young women offered 'arrangements' in exchange for accommodation. It comes as female Ukrainian refugees described being harassed by men online after posting on Facebook groups in search of a sponsor. Last night politicians and chari- ties urged the Government to close 'dangerous loopholes' and put proper safeguarding measures in place to prevent vulnerable refugees being exploited. On Friday the Government launched a matching scheme - linking UK sponsors with Ukrainian refugees - despite warnings that predators could exploit the initiative. But it comes two weeks after the Homes for Ukraine scheme first opened for applications, meaning thousands of refugees have already been driven to use unregulated social media groups to find a sponsor. Once Ukrainians find a British host, they can apply for a visa. This is initially processed by the Home Office and then passed to the relevant local authority, which is responsible for ensuring the accommodation is fit for purpose. But the whistleblower, who works for a council in the Midlands, said she fears the scheme could become 'a completely assisted exploitation exercise'. While she is sure the majority of people offering their homes are doing so out of kindness, she is worried a minority may have ill intentions. The worker is concerned the results of Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks carried out on hosts will not come back before the Ukrainian refugees arrive, although Home Office sources said they would be 'expedited'. When an evacuee arrives in this country they will probably go straight to their host's home regardless of the status of the host's official approval, meaning it is possible that safeguarding issues will not be picked up in time, the whistleblower warned. The host, however, will not be able to claim the £350-per-month compensation until they have been vetted. The council worker said: 'All of this has been put on local authorities to make decisions without the right frameworks. And without that safety net, I can imagine that somehow this will go wrong. 'I worry there'll be a massive abuse case that happens within my local authority and it will be us who come under fire for failing safeguarding duties, when actually we did everything we possibly could.' The council staffer said there are an 'awful lot of very young, very beautiful girls' looking for a sponsor on platforms such as Facebook, and they are flooded with responses. 'It doesn't inspire confidence that these people are in it for the right reasons,' she added. Positive Action in Housing, a homelessness charity, said men had been targeting young Ukrainian women who posted on Facebook looking for information about the scheme. One 'host' claimed to be a doctor with a 'big empty house', and offered accommodation, food, expenses and a monthly allowance as part of an 'arrangement' - a term often used to imply sexual activity. Ukrainian evacuee, Olena, 25, found her sponsor through Facebook after posting a picture of herself along with some brief details. While she was overwhelmed by how many generous responses she received, she was also alarmed to receive messages from single men wanting to host her. One man wrote: 'I have a small space in my apartment... I am single and live alone. I hope it's not a problem. My apartment is small but I can help you or someone alone.' Another said: 'I live alone in a three-bedroom, three-floor house in central London and would be happy to help you with accommodation and anything else that you will need.' Some continued to message her even after she announced she had found a host, pressing for details of the address she would be moving to. A search on one Facebook group showed one man, who was single and offering a room in Weston-super- Mare, Somerset, had liked three posts in the group - all by women aged 23, 30 and 33. Labour peer Bar- oness Kennedy of Cradley said it is 'desperately worrying' that some women have been targeted online by men who have tried to 'coerce' information from them about their location. 'It is also worrying that councils are receiving matches via the Home Office between single men over 50 and single women in their 20s,' she added. 'The Government needs to ensure there are proper safeguards in place for all the women and girls fleeing war and seeking sanctuary here.' Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, said: 'So-called ""sponsors"" registered with Homes for Ukraine have gone on to social media to offer shelter for sex to war refugees. We expect to see much worse in the coming weeks and months.' Louise Calvey, from Refugee Action, said: 'We are concerned that issues with the scheme mean that it risks being a Tinder for sex traffickers.' A government spokesman said: 'We have designed our Homes for Ukraine scheme specifically to have safeguards in place - including robust security and background checks on all www.sponsors.No visa will be issued until the Home Office has completed checks on all adults in a sponsor's household as well as on the applicants from Ukraine. 'At the time of application, local authorities are notified to begin DBS checks, which will be expedited by the Home Office, so they can arrange in-person visits.'

11,urc_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,20/3/2022,569 words,Patricia Kane,Charles considers plan to give refugees shelter at Dumfries House estate,"SENIOR Royals are considering plans to open some of their homes to Ukrainian refugees fleeing the horrors of war. Aides to the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William are understood to be examining a range of 'practical measures', including the possibility of jobs and training courses, as well as providing accommodation. Charles is said to be looking at finding spaces on his Dumfries House estate in Ayrshire as well as sites across his Duchy of Cornwall holdings, which include a number of holiday homes. The Queen's Balmoral estate on Royal Deeside and Sandringham in Norfolk, which are both private and not funded by the taxpayer, could also provide space in holiday-rental cottages and offer temporary tourism-related and hospitality jobs. A source told The Mail on Sunday: 'All the households are united in this - the Queen, Charles and William - with all three agreed that they should find a practical way to help Ukrainian refugees. 'It means looking at accommodation options in England, including the Duchy of Cornwall, where Charles has a lot of holiday homes, and Scotland, where he has Dumfries House and the Queen has Balmoral estate.' The Queen, Charles and his wife Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have all donated to a coalition of 15 British charities working on the Disasters Emergency Committee Ukraine appeal. Charles and William have also spoken out in support of Ukrainians resisting Russian aggression, but it is understood they are keen to do more as Britons prepare to welcome refugees under the Government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. An insider at Dumfries House said the Prince's Foundation, a charity that manages the 2,000-acre estate, was actively looking at how it could help Ukrainians with work, courses and accommodation. The estate's education centre regularly offers training courses in skills from horticulture and sustainable farm practices to engineering. A Royal spokesman last night said: 'The Royal Household is looking at a number of ways to offer practical help and support.' The royal family in Belgium last week said it would host three families of Ukrainian refugees. Last year, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde housed some of those who lost their homes in flooding. Scottish Land & Estates (SLE), a body that represents country estates north of the border, last week said it had received pledges to provide help from more than 40 landowners. It is understood that SLE approached Balmoral, the Queen's private 50,000-acre estate, which will open to the public next month and is currently advertising for waiting and housekeeping staff as well as 'visitor enterprise assistants' with accommodation provided. William and Kate have also offered to use their Royal Foundation to provide support for Ukrainians with mental health problems after the horrors they have witnessed. Dee Ward, Vice Chair at SLE, said: 'As estates are rural businesses, many are in the fortunate position of being able to offer not just accommodation but also employment opportunities. 'There will be many Ukrainian people with experience and talent in farming, food production and hospitality that can be of real value to our rural communities. We are under no illusion how difficult it will be for Ukrainians coming here, but we want to work with the Scottish and UK governments to provide opportunities for individuals and families wherever we can.'

AND BEGS FOR HELP BY IAN GALLAGHER CHIEF REPORTER The Les Kurbas Theatre in central Lviv would be playing to a packed house tonight if times were different. But instead of actors performing Anthony Horowitz's psychological thriller Mindgame, displaced Ukrainians occupy the stage. In fact, they sleep on it, their belongings grouped around camp beds. They also fill the stalls. And one woman even beds down on a balcony in the upper circle. It feels as though I've got the last bed in town,' says Lena Mazurkina, 33, a hairdresser who arrived at the theatre from bombed-out Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine yesterday. Lviv, 50 miles from the Polish border, is the relative safe haven for those fleeing the fighting in the east. But it is at bursting point. So much so that its mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, has issued a desperate plea for help. Lviv can no longer cope, he says. Roughly the size of Nottingham, the city has sheltered 200,000 women and children since the Russian invasion began two weeks ago. Finding a hotel room is near impossible. Apartments, too, are fully booked. Some 35,000 refugees sleep in empty schools - pupils were sent home when the fighting started - while thousands more find space in churches and sports stadiums. The exodus is unlikely to abate any time soon and, with barely an inch of the city left unclaimed, the mayor says huge tents with fully equipped kitchens are now needed to cope with new arrivals. Sometimes he feels as though responsibility for handling Europe's fastest growing refugee crisis since the Second World War rests almost entirely on his shoulders. We really need support,' he says. Directing operations from his town hall office in historic Rynok Square, he rarely gets more than three hours' sleep a night. Hiding from bombings and missile strikes, the women and children left their homes and came to us - and 440 different institutions opened their doors, providing a roof over heads and hot food,' he says. Every day, there are more and more people coming in. It's our responsibility to accept everyone.' Mr Sadovyi isn't one to mince words. Last week he called on Boris Johnson to seize the villas of Russian oligarchs living in London and to use them to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. Now he has a blunt request for humanitarian organisations - of which precious few are visible in Lviv. We need your help. Not abroad, not on a border, but here. We need your experience. We have never encountered this before. Our citizens stay in Lviv because they believe we will win.' For the time being, assistance comes via the kindness of inspirational locals - some of whom have taken up weapons training to prepare against the Russian threat. Arriving in Lviv's main railway station, Miss Mazurkina and her mother bumped into some volunteers who told them about the theatre. I have to say it is the last place I expected to sleep,' she says. But it's warm and safe and much, much better than being in Kharkiv, hiding in shelters from bombs every night.' It has been two days since the last air raid siren in Lviv but when it is next sounded, Miss Mazurkina and her mother will find themselves sharing a shelter with props and scenery pushed to one side in the basement. In the foyer, a little boy plays on the piano as volunteers sort through bags of donated clothes. There is far too much of everything, but that's the Lvivites: Generous to a fault. It was one of the city's most famous actresses, Natalia Rybka-Parhomenko, 33, who decided to turn the theatre into a shelter when she saw the first reports of people fleeing. First she discussed her plan with her friend, the mayor's wife, who consulted her husband. He thought it a fine idea. I felt I had to do something,' says Natalia, a Kharkiv native who has performed at the Les Kurbas for the past 17 years. I am so very shocked by what has happened. A war such as this in the 21st century? My God, what have we become? We needed to find space for all these people fleeing from the east. The director here was in full agreement and so we turned the place into a refuge. There are 27 people here at the moment, mainly mothers and babies.' Pushing aside heavy red velvet curtains, Natalia leads us into the stalls, with seats removed to make way for beds. Food is stacked on trestle tables in the middle of the auditorium. At the end of one table, English teacher Tamila Kheladze, 32, from Kyiv, patiently feeds her 14-month-old son Dennis. Having said goodbye to her husband, a banker, she moved to her parents' village 50 miles from the city but moved further west, she says, when she heard reports of Russian soldiers executing people in the next village. I feel fortunate to be here in the theatre. When we arrived earlier this week the city was full up and I thought we might have to sleep in the cold at the station,' she says. My baby keeps me strong, gives me focus. If I didn't have him I would never have left Kyiv, I'd be at my husband's side doing whatever is necessary. They've said we can stay as long as we like here, but I plan to go to Sweden to stay with friends. My heart feels as if it is breaking a little every day but we will get through this, we will win.' Before we leave, Natalia tells us that Les Kurbas, the Ukrainian director who gives his name to the theatre, was persecuted during the Soviet era and, like other cultural figures, sent to a labour camp. Even there however, he still managed to organise a theatre group. There is something defiant about what we are doing here too,' she says. This weekend the curtain was due to go up on a new production, Suddenly Last Summer by Tennessee Williams. Who knows when we will open again,' says Natalia. But the actors have all agreed that when we do, it will be something happy - with lots of singing.' v © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2022-03,0,Conditions

They will have access to a special fund of (EURO)3billion for next year, up from an agreed figure of (EURO)2.5billion just last week. LIMITS Minister Other measures decided on at Cabinet yesterday afternoon included the housing of refugees in college dorms when the students have gone home for the summer - this could add another 6,000 beds to the accommodation tally - and the speeding up of the conversion of vacant social houses, also known as ""voids"", into refugee housing, delivering up to another 2,500 more beds.

Taoiseach Micheal Martin, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar and Greens chief Eamon Ryan will head up the new Cabinet super-committee. We have now welcomed more than 25,000 Ukrainians who have escaped the war. The Government's latest estimate is that we could be providing sanctuary for up to 33,000 by the end of May. Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien told the Cabinet he is securing emergency powers to make it quicker to convert empty council houses.

Their work will be discussed at a Cabinet committee on October 24. There is also the possibility that Ukrainian refugees will have to contribute towards monthly bills in pledged accommodation and social welfare supports may be time limited. The Government is said to be worried that the State is reaching its limit in housing Ukrainian refugees as many more than expected arrive here. There are also concerns that many hotel contracts will run out at the end of the year putting even more strain on the system.

A heartbreaking symbol of its human cost, the iconic photo set the tone for a conflict in which civilians have been the main target. Now, a month on, we can reveal the woman in the picture, 52-year-old teacher Olena Kurilo, is safe in Poland after a flight from her homeland. A source close to her family told us: ""She wants to be the face of peace, not of war."" We need or We no-fly WOUNDED HAS ESCAPED And yesterday the thousands in London marching in support of her and millions of Ukrainians would have echoed that desire. Olena's agony began on February 24 when her home in Chuhuiv, near Kharkiv, was blasted by a Russian rocket. Glass from a shattered window in her room hit her in the face, causing a serious eye wound. The mum-of-one then spent more than three weeks in the rubble as Russian and Ukrainian forces battled around the village. When Olena did manage to make her way to hospital, she found herself accused of being an actress by the Russian media. They said the photo of her with bandaged wounds, taken shortly after the attack, was from a gas explosion in 2018. Her blogger daughter Katerina has been on Instagram dispelling the fake news. And after the hospital patched up her wounds, Olena posed for a photo holding her passport to prove her identity. The last time Olena made a public statement was via Instagram on March 13. She shared the words: ""We don't need bread, food or water, all we need is a no-fly zone. Save Ukraine from explosions and rockets. don't bread water. ""The country is already in ruins.

Vadym Boichenko, the city's mayor, said he had spoken to the French ambassador to Ukraine about evacuating civilians. French President Emmanuel Macron said he would discuss with Russia a plan to help people leave. It came as Ukraine's office of the prosecutor general said the war had killed 136 children. Oleksandr Pavlyuk, Kyiv regional governor, said Russian forces had taken the town of Slavutych, home to workers at the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Its protesting, flag-waving resi- dents were dispersed by stun grenades. As Vladimir Putin said the war was entering ""phase two"" - suggesting he may focus on the Eastern Donbas region after military failures - his army was last night on the brink of losing Kherson. The southern city is the only major metropolis they hold in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have counterattacked amid claims the Russians are short of food, weapons and ammunition. Loss of the city would be a major blow to Putin's plan to create a so-called land bridge from the Crimea peninsula to the disputed Donbas region. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said more than 16,000 Russians have been killed, including commanders. He also warned yesterday of Russia's nuclear threat. He said: ""They are bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons not only a certain country but the entire planet.""

Around 200 Ukrainian refugees are living at the Skellig Accommodation Centre under a temporary protection order. They were staying in a hotel and self-catering apartments.

""One of the things that we'll examine over the next couple of weeks is how we can make sure that we have more appropriate and more robust border controls to make sure that people aren't able to enter the country illegally,"" he told reporters on January 11. ""The vast majority of people who come here from overseas do so legally. That's absolutely right. But those who don't, obviously, we have to protect against that."" Fast forward one month and the same conversations were taking place at a European level meeting in Brussels, this time against the backdrop of growing protests against the numbers of migrants arriving here. Varadkar has joined Austrian, Belgian, Danish and Dutch leaders in calling for tighter border controls. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has suggested ""fences"" in an echo of Donald Trump's border wall. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not be used to pay for fences. expel She did, however, announce that leaders agreed to new rules making it easier to expel people whose refugee applications are denied. If a person's asylum application is rejected in another EU member state, any other country in the bloc can use this decision to return a migrant to their home country. The discussions come at a time when Ireland is struggling to provide accommodation to International Protection seekers. Due to capacity constraints, Integration Minister Roderic O'Gorman was forced to close the Citywest Transit Hub to new single arrivals, leaving many without accommodation in winter. The latest figures from his Department show that there were a total of 194 arrivals for the week ending February 5, an average of 27 a day. This does not include Ukrainian refugees. Some 76 (39 per cent) were single males. These are the people who have been left without accommodation. Of the 19,741 asylum seekers in State-provided accommodation, 3,257 are from Georgia. Another 2,383 are from Nigeria, 2,050 are from Algeria and 1,853 are from Zimbabwe. They are from 47 different countries in total. Government sources believe that the increase is, in part, due to the UK's crackdown on asylum seekers. Shortly after the British government announced a plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, the number of refugees who arrived climbed so suddenly that people were left sleeping on the floor of Dublin Airport. It was one of many measures taken by the UK. It reached a deal with Albania to place more UK Border Force Staff in its capital Tirana. To a lesser extent, the Irish Government is also attempting to tackle migration. It has been reported that gardai are checking the documents of those seeking asylum before they get off the plane. It was also reported that more than 5,000 asylum seekers entered Ireland with false documents or none at all last year. A key task for the Government will be balancing tighter controls on migration without stoking the fire under far-right agitators. The number of protests taking place outside places providing accommodation for asylum seekers continues to grow week by week. The Taoiseach warned TDs their language could inadvertently play into the hands of these protesters. The Government will have to make sure its language and actions on migration do not do the same. news@irishmirror.ie Graphic   ran out of capacity The Citywest hubsummit Ursula von der Leyenintegration Minister O'Gormantalks Taoiseach Leo Varadkar",Tabloid,0,2023-02,0,Migration

Gardai confirmed that a technical exam will be carried out at the scene of an old convent in Lanesboro, Co Longford, where a fire took place on Tuesday. In a statement, the Department of Integration confirmed that the property had been offered for use as Ukrainian refugee accommodation and had been undergoing renovation. Joe Flaherty, Fianna Fail TD for Longford-Westmeath, told the Irish Mirror the owners have now withdrawn their offer. He said that it had been offered for two years, adding: ""It was at the owners' instigation that the contract was terminated. ""I would be deeply troubled by the fire. I can appreciate that anything like this causes a certain amount of concern in a local community. ""I think What happened in Lanesboro has been, probably, fuelled by what's happening in other parts of the country. ""Four hundred metres away from this location there is an old nursing home and 80 odd Ukrainians have been living there for more than six months now with no issue and [they have] accumulated relatively well into the local community. ""The understanding locally is that it wasn't a local who burnt it, it was an outsider who burnt it. ""It could have been a tragedy, there are commercial businesses alongside it, there are residential houses on the other side. It could have been an absolute disaster."" Mr Flaherty said that the fire happened against a ""backdrop"" of very little communication from the Department of Integration about the property. He said that he has asked for clarification on several sites across Longford linked to asylum or refugee accommodation and has not had a response. He added: ""I don't think the fact that the building has gone on fire says that the people are racist or unreceptive to people fleeing war."" Speaking to RTE, Justice Minister Helen McEntee said gardai are doing ""everything that they can"" to ensure the safety of refugees and asylum seekers who have been placed in accommodation centres. news@irishmirror.ie Graphic   COMMENTS Fianna Fail TD Joe Flaherty",Tabloid,0,2024-01,0,Migration

The figure is expected to rise to 107,000 by the end of June 2023, according to a study conducted by Women in AI Ireland's WaiPRACTICE programme. The data focused on the influx of refugees to Ireland since the turn of the century and created a machine-learning model capable of predicting future numbers. The aim of the project is to help lawmakers plan and assess which areas will need additional resources to deal with the influx. Researchers found that 61,000 Ukrainians had been allocated Personal Public Service Numbers by the end of November this year. Based on historical trends, the researchers' model predicts if the war continues another 30,000 Ukrainians will arrive in Ireland by the middle of March, with a further 17,000 arriving between March and the end of June. This would bring the number of new arrivals from Ukraine in the first six months of 2023 to 46,000, adding up to a total of 107,000. The study was in partnership with CeADAR, Ireland's Centre for Applied AI. CeADAR mentor Natalia Resende said: ""The outputs we delivered have the potential to be used by official bodies, such as the Refugee Council, to make plans and allocate resources for the coming year.""",Tabloid,0,2022-12,0,Migration

The refugee students aged 15 to 21, like the lions, were saved from Russian warmonger Vladimir Putin's rockets. Listening to the beasts at Yorkshire Wildlife Park, Yelizoete Terletsko, 18, said: ""I was really upset they had to leave our home in Ukraine, the same as me. But I'm really grateful that people helped them like they did me and we are all in a safe place now."" Later she squealed in delight as a giraffe grabbed a branch from her and said: ""They're so strong."" Yelizoete recalled her sister phoning her to say the war had started. The school for the blind in the northern city of Kharkiv was one of the first buildings to be bombed. The students, many of whom are orphans, were evacuated to Poland a day before it was virtually destroyed. Yelizoete said: ""I thought 'how can there be war in the 21st century? How can that happen? When the bombing began I was worried I wouldn't survive. ""Because we're blind we can hear differently. You can hear more and you feel the noises in your body. Rats ""It was a horrible experience and I hope it all finishes soon because I never want to hear the bombs again."" Initially, the 70-year-old headmaster decided everyone should hide in the school's basement, with staff securing the school's windows with mattresses to protect against rocket attacks. The students were traumatised by both the rats in the basement, and the rocket attacks outside. Deputy head teacher Marzena Bialas said: ""They're really excited about the lions in Yorkshire. They didn't know they had been shipped over to the UK. When we told them about it they googled the Mirror. They also phoned their old head teacher to tell him they were visiting lions from Ukraine."" The head teacher from the Polish school, Violetta Trzcina, said the 14 students had now been with them for two years. She said: ""We can't thank everyone enough for this trip as it is helping not only kids but blind adults to forget about the tragic situation in Ukraine."" The students have been supported by the Duchess of York, who helped to arrange the wildlife visit and the Thomas Pocklington Trust and the RNIB who funded their trip to the UK. Sarah, Duchess of York told the Mirror she had met the students a number of times and it was ""wonderful"" they'd been able to visit Yorkshire. She said: ""I hope the visit brings smiles to their faces - for me the smile of a child has always been the most important thing. ""They have been through unimagi- n a b l e trauma, separated from their families, broken apart by the dreadful Russian invasion. It is just the most appalling situation. ""I first met the group in Poland at the onset of the war, where my charity has worked for many years. I was humbled to hear their story of survival and determination, and we have remained in touch ever since. It is an honour for me to call them my friends."" The group were also taken behind the scenes at the Park, near Doncaster, and listened to some of the ""most vocal mammals on the planet"", the sea lions. Then they had a private audience in the lion enclosure where Aysa and her three cubs, Santa, Emi and Teddi, are settling in. The big cats roared as the youngsters were told about their journey by the ranger. The small pride arrived last week thanks to help from the park's Wildlife Foundation who funded the trip. Pregnant Aysa was first moved from a private zoo in Donetsk, Ukraine, to the country's capital Kyiv. She gave birth to the cubs there, and the family went to Poznan in Poland, where they were safe but unable to see the sky for nine months. After crossing six countries and travelling more than 2,000 miles they finally arrived at their safe haven in Auckley last Thursday. Within days, they had settled so much, the rangers felt able to remove the steel panel between their mum's pen and theirs so they are now separated by see-through mesh. The rangers say all have been head rubbing and ""showing really positive signs"", with Emi lying next to her mum by the mesh all day long. As we watch, Emi won't leave the mesh, and appears to be trying to touch her mum with her paw resting in the space between the pens. HORRIBLE The rangers are planning to let them have access into an area which overlooks their huge eight acre enclosure, where they will live eventually. As they roared at the visitors, Bohdan Ustiianskyi, 18, told us: ""I feel emotional that I can be here. I never dreamed I would travel so much. ""It was a big surprise to find out about the lions from Ukraine, it's similar to our story."" He told how he woke to hear shouting about the war starting and a tank parked outside their school. They did not know if it was Ukrainian or Russian. He said: ""It was horrible. It was an old building and the walls were shaking, the bombing was so close to us in the centre of Kharkiv. ""We stayed in the basement only going upstairs to brush our teeth. I was scared. We didn't understand what was going on because we could not see it.

""They are so intrigued about everything that is going on. It's amazing how war can affect humans and animals together. But this shows how everyone can make a difference by coming together."" The co-founder of the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, Cheryl Williams, said; ""I could not believe it when I had the phone call from the Duchess of York's office asking if their group of young people could visit us.

But then Russia invaded her native Ukraine and everything changed. Despite her devastation and anxiety about family under threat, she knew she had to help - and quickly. Since then she has raised over a million pounds to send vital aid to those affected by the war, including her brother, who is bravely defending their beloved country. Diana Henry meets her at home","Olia Hercules' kitchen is usually a sanctuary, a place where the Ukrainian chef and author tests recipes, writes award-winning cookbooks and feeds her children. Today it's chaotic: toys underfoot, Ukrainian tablecloths scattered on the sofa, huge houseplants that need watering? but her priority is lunch. She rolls out an oval of pasta dough - it's perfect, silky and supple - and cuts it into ribbons, just enough for two. Given what she's going through I'm amazed she can cook, let alone cook for guests. She offers the pasta, dressed with tomato sauce. 'I have to make myself eat,' she says firmly. 'And if you eat, I will eat.' Hercules was born in south Ukraine but has lived in the UK since she came here, aged 18, to study Italian and international relations. She became a chef - partly because cooking helped keep her connected to her home and family - and eventually a food writer and teacher. In her books, particularly Mamushka and Summer Kitchens, she encourages us to appreciate Ukraine through food and stories. Her Instagram has always pulsed with colour - the pink-green stripy Ukrainian tomatoes she picks with her mother in the summer, jars of preserved beets, meals eaten beneath canopies of greenery. She posts short videos of her cooking too, always wearing one of her trademark Ukrainian scarves round her head. When Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Hercules became more than a food writer, she became an activist, a warrior. That day she posted old black-and-white photographs of her maternal grandmother, who had been put on a cattle train in the 1930s and transported to Siberia, and her paternal grandmother, whose father - a cobbler - had been shot by Bolsheviks. They then took his cow and his house and left his family with nothing. 'You may be rattling your sabre,' Hercules wrote, in the accompanying post, 'but we have a million cloaked ghosts behind us, sharpening their scythes, waiting for you. These are my ghosts. They may be dead, but their spirit is within me? If they managed to overcome these horrors, trust me, we will resist your psychopathic tsarist ambitions.' My spine tingled. I marvelled at this strength and started to check her posts several times a day. It felt as if she was on the frontline, even though she was in east London. Hercules, 38, is stunningly beautiful, and usually has the most perfect red lips. Today she looks exhausted, and cries intermittently. 'We really didn't expect Putin to invade,' she says, 'it was a huge shock.' She stops to take a breath and holds her head in her hands. 'Despite what happened in Crimea, we didn't see it coming. I mean, what is the justification for invading a country where people are just going about their daily lives?' The sheer shock floored her. Her parents were in Ukraine - her home town is Kakhovka, 80 miles from Crimea - together with her brother and endless aunts, uncles and cousins. my parents every day I didn't know how to live, how to exist with this horror. I could hear gunfire in the background when we talked. Sometimes I just shouted and cried. I told my husband I didn't want to go on. At other times I felt the strongest I have ever felt in my life.' She believes Ukrainians live with the trauma of their past: 'Ukraine has always been attacked. It's a corridor between Asia and Europe, it's vulnerable. My whole life I've suffered from some kind of anxiety or other. It's as if Ukrainians are born with this and hold on to it as a way of preparing themselves to cope. I get very anxious about small things, but I seem to have reserves for the big things. Do you know the word znyschyty? It means to crush a country. That's what some Russians have been trying to do for years, to obliterate our culture and our language. We lived through Stalin, and we will get through this. In a sense I was ready. I've been preparing for this all my life.' She plugged into these reserves, pushed aside the shock and replaced it with defiant energy. Her brother, Sasha, joined the civilian army to fight in Kyiv but had, like most Ukrainian men, no equipment except a rifle, and no training. 'One week people were on their laptops drinking lattes. Sasha was working on his start-up. The next my cousins were making Molotov cocktails. My brother thought he could fight in jeans and track shoes. They needed vests, boots, helmets and radios,' says Hercules. 'I didn't even stop to think about it, there was work to be done and that was that.' Hercules didn't set up a charity to raise money, she put the details of a PayPal account on her Instagram posts. 'People said that I had to do things properly but there was no time for that. I needed to get money in.' In just two days she had amassed £100,000 and the money was still coming. Wars are usually delivered through headlines and cold specifics - which towns are being bombed, the that there were real people suffering in Ukraine, and she brought us their stories every day. The public had trust in her to do the right thing with their money. 'I was overwhelmed by the response here,' she says. 'I'm in awe of the British people.' Before long she had volunteers working round her kitchen table, answering phone calls and emails, helping the public understand how to donate. 'People just came. They held me up, they worked with me,' she says. A woman she didn't even know brought her broth to help keep her strength up. 'As soon as I tasted it, I was able to eat. I ate only that broth for weeks.' Her life became a whirlwind of media interviews. She was photographed in her Ukrainian blouses - she had always worn these, it wasn't just for this new role - with her hands on her hips, looking like the mamushkas, the mothers and grandmothers, the strong Ukrainian women she so admires. The number following her Instagram account rocketed. She harnessed social media's power to disseminate news, to raise money, to let people see what the real Ukraine was like, not a country of fascists as Putin would have you believe. She posted powerful videos speaking You could see how tired and traumatised she was. 'I didn't think about trolls or becoming well known,' she says. 'Social media was a way to communicate with people, so I did it.' The most powerful thing Hercules posted during this time was a video of her brother in falling snow. He was speaking in Ukrainian so I couldn't understand a word, and yet I could understand all of it. Sasha was smiling broadly, excitedly showing us his fellow combatants with their new equipment. This is what Hercules had achieved. I watched it through tears. With her friends, Russian food writer Alissa Timoshkina and social-media influencer Clerkenwell Boy, Hercules established Cook for Ukraine. The idea was to hold suppers, organise cake sales, do any food-focused activity you could to raise money for charities working in Ukraine, including Unicef. It has raised more than £1 million. Hercules got Covid, but within days she was posting pictures that showed Ukraine during an idyllic summer. Images of wars are unremittingly bleak, but she posted a Ukraine of sunflower fields, ripe watermelons and meadows. You could feel the warm lazy air and understand why Ukrainians are fighting so hard to hold on to their country. parents - journalists and activists - started being kidnapped she was terrified and pleaded with them to leave: 'They were very stubborn. They didn't see why they should go when they'd done nothing wrong. Mum has a B&B and my father has a company that makes agricultural equipment. They felt responsible for their employees. Then I learnt that they had received threats and kept this information from me. I had a hysterical attack, an anxiety attack I suppose you'd call it, on the phone to them. I told them I wouldn't be able to go on if they died. I asked what would then happen to my children, to my family here. They gave in.' Her parents' exodus was slow. They had to negotiate 19 checkpoints. 'My mum said she wasn't scared but that she had never experienced such humiliation. She explained there were three types of Russian soldier, the ones who looked as if they were from the most deprived backgrounds, those who were so young they weren't even shaving and, the worst, the very confident, older types who would goad you.' At the last checkpoint one of these older men asked for her name, then asked again, slowly studying her passport, then said, 'Why are you leaving?' Her father drove for five days to get to Germany, where a family member had a small holiday home. Hercules flew there, arriving before they did, to cook for them. She made borscht, the Ukrainian national dish. 'They had such pride,' she says. 'My mum told me that the house looked lovely and that, when the Russians came, they would find a well-kept home. She took only family photographs and small pieces of her embroidery - she hid the larger pieces. It was heartbreaking.' With her parents safe she could get a little peace. Her husband, Joe Woodhouse, a food photographer and writer, had been holding everything together - their two children, family meals and Hercules herself. I got in touch with him during what looked like the worst period to see how she was. 'There are swings from low to lower,' he said. 'We are learning to cope with this new norm every day.' Hercules started posting pictures of outings with the children, looking happy, and of herself from the past - in Paris, in Italy - as if she was trying to hold on to who she had been before the invasion. With every post she talked about Ukraine. She needed to 'keep Ukraine front of mind'. She managed to get her 13-year-old niece, who is now living with them, out of Ukraine. Hercules is still delivering 'human news bulletins' every day, along with updates on the visa situation and advice on what food to buy if you're welcoming Ukrainian refugees into your home. She gets a video from Sasha every morning. 'It always arrives at the same time,' she says. '7am.' How, I ask, will this end? 'I have read everything and watched everything I can about Putin,' she says, 'I don't know whether he acts like this because he grew up in poverty, or whether it's because a rat he'd cornered attacked him when he was a boy, and I really don't care.' I believe he loves Ukraine, I say, and that he had his honeymoon there. 'F?k him,' she says, swiping the air. 'And Henry Kissinger with his idea of giving territory to Russia to end the war, f?k him too.' She believes that, with arms from the West, Ukraine will hold Russia back. 'But what I really want to see is Russians taking to the streets to protest.' 'I suppose they're scared,' I say. She bristles. 'We're scared! Ukrainians are scared! But if enough Russians protest, en masse, it will work. They can't throw everyone in prison.' She believes the war will be over by the autumn. What about the pundits who predict it will go on for at least a decade? She slumps. 'I can't contemplate that. Next summer I want to be in Ukraine. We have a huge family gathering, we call it ""the summit"", where we all get together to talk and eat and drink outside underneath my mum's vines. We're going to be there.' Her latest book was finished in 2021, when this crisis hadn't been foreseen, but it's uncannily apt. It's called Home Food: Recipes To Comfort and Connect. Hercules was taught, by her mother and aunts, that cooking can be an act of defiance and self-preservation. There are sublime Ukrainian dishes in this book, but recipes from the rest of her life too.

3661,urc_dailytelegraph_raw.docx,Daily Telegraph,15/3/2022,864 words,CHARLES MOORE,Are we ready to offer sanctuary for the long run?,"Judging by the remarkable public response, I suspect there might soon be more offers of housing for Ukrainian refugees here than Ukrainians wishing to take them up. The Government has now announced its backing for schemes all over the country. The response has been huge, even before the formal announcement. My own small experience confirms the enthusiasm. On BBC Any Questions? on Friday night, I mentioned that, in our rural Sussex parish, the parochial church councils were starting to coordinate a local contribution. Since then, my wife - in her role as churchwarden - and I have had numerous inquiries. Yesterday, I spoke to our dynamic, new and young rector (you don't find so many of them in the English countryside), the Rev Thomas Pelham. He confirmed the situation. With the encouragement of the bishops of the Chichester diocese, parishes are signing up with a national charity called the Sanctuary Foundation. The type of help to be offered is intended to cover a broad range. At the lower end of commitment, it would mean things like picking people up from airports. It would also run to helping with food, offering friendship etc. At the high end, it would involve accommodation. The charity accepts direct, individual offers of help as well as group offers such as that from our parish. Looking at the Sanctuary Foundation's website, I am impressed that it is honest enough to include a testimonial from a volunteer who warns how tricky it can be if you take a refugee into your home. The example cited is refugees who came from professional backgrounds and did not fit the traditional image of a starving peasant grateful for a crust. They were sophisticated people looking for a good job. Their hosts found it difficult to match their hopes. The message of such warnings is that it is wonderful so many people want to help, but any offer must be built to last - the human equivalent of the slogan that a pet is for life, not just for Christmas. Offer it only if you understand what it involves. . The logic of putting refugees in real homes not grim hostels also suggests letting them get real jobs, not forcing them to live on handouts. So it is out of kilter that the Home Office is currently trying to increase the wage in the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme to the equivalent of £25,500 a year just when Ukrainians are arriving. It is too much for employers, who are already committed to upping their rate to £9.50 an hour from next month. Put it higher still and the jobs dry up. . I have seen some complaint that more people are coming forward for Ukrainians than did for Middle Eastern refugees. This shows prejudice against non-Europeans, it is alleged. This is probably unfair. Our sense of responsibility for those in such a plight in our own continent is natural. We rightly feel some collective guilt for not acting earlier and not hitting hard enough at Putin. There is also a difference in the nature of those arriving. Many Middle Eastern and African refugees in recent years have been young men without families. This has made it likelier they will include extremists and criminals. Religion is, unfortunately, relevant. The ferment in Islam does mean that jihadists infiltrate the movement of peoples. In the Ukrainian case, most refugees are women and children. Their men stay behind to www.fight.No doubt we must watch out for organised criminal gangs and a few Russian undercover agents, but I don't think we need worry that the Orthodox Church of Ukraine or the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church contain militants who mean harm to Britain. . Yet again, tomorrow, the House of Lords is to debate ""assisted dying"". (The more accurate phrase is ""assisted suicide"": this is not about the existing help to make death less painful.) The form this time is a backbench amendment to the Health and Care Bill telling the Government to draft an assisted dying Bill. This is unconstitutional because it undermines the Government's right to decide what legislation it introduces. Besides, assisted suicide is a question for the criminal law, not a Bill about healthcare. There is an irony here. The Health and Care Bill is the first to make palliative care a core purpose of the National Health Service, a welcome development. The assisted dying amendment would go against the spirit of this change. Three quarters of doctors involved in palliative medicine resist any involvement in assisted dying procedures. They know that palliative care addresses, much more humanely and professionally, the agony and indignity which can accompany the approach of death. . Like hundreds of thousands, our family wishes to fly the Ukrainian flag. A large one already flutters bravely in the public gardens, named after the present Queen's Coronation, in our village. The problem, however, is sourcing. There are plenty of such flags to be had, but most seem to be made in China, which in effect supports the Russian invasion. A false flag, you might almost say. I am glad to report my wife found one made in Taiwan, and it has just arrived; but surely there is an opening here for an enterprising British flag producer, perhaps in aid of the refugees. read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion",Broadsheet,1,2022-03,1,Aid

The forerunner of Border Force, the UK Immigration Service, was flexible in its response to various crises - in Kosovo, for instance. Staff have always had a ""can do"" attitude to apparently overwhelming problems, yet the present management lacks this. Border Force and immigration enforcement staff are stretched beyond capacity by boats crossing the English Channel. A pool of experienced former staff - many of whom worked as visa officers and managers in embassies and high commissions overseas - would be willing to help to establish visa sections in Calais, other Channel ports or even further afield within the EU, but they have been overlooked.

The First Minister yesterday welcomed the announcement, saying that refugees would be given temporary accommodation while a more permanent place is found for them. She said multi-agency teams are working to ensure accommodation, safeguarding and support ""as well as the warmest of welcomes"" is provided.

Welcoming the extension of the scheme, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Our distinct offer for a warm Scottish welcome to the displaced people of Ukraine is now open, as part of the UK's Homes for Ukraine.

He was sacked after management concluded his ""egregious"" failings in the role had caused damage to the company's reputation. An employment tribunal heard that last November Mr Miller was sent an email by a local councillor that detailed a community meeting which 12 Ukrainians staying at one of the resort's hotels - the Strathspey Hotel - had attended. ""The forwarded email set out that the refugees had told harrowing stories of living conditions in the Strathspey Hotel and provided photographs and video to back up concerns,"" the tribunal heard. Complaints included lifts being out of service in the seven-storey building, ""infestation with vermin"", ""appalling food especially for children, with a daily diet of chips, and whatever nugget was provided"", the hearing was told. Eleven days after the email was sent, Mr Miller faced a disciplinary hearing. Among the accusations he faced was a claim that he had failed to ""properly oversee arrangements at Strathspey Hotel for a group of Ukrainian refugees placed with us"" and that he had responded without talking to Macdonald Hotel managers. His boss, Natalya Macholla, upheld four allegations and dismissed him without notice last December, the hearing was told. He appealed unsuccessfully against the management's findings and then sued the company for unfair dismissal, but his case was thrown out after the tribunal concluded that he was guilty of ""non-observance"" of his duties. However, his case was thrown out after the tribunal concluded that as the most senior person on site he was accountable for what had gone wrong.

The Scottish Government's Super Sponsor scheme, which was launched in March, has descended into chaos as almost 30,000 visas have been issued to people fleeing the Russian invasion, but there is not enough safe housing for them to live in. Officials have so far refused to release figures on how many Scots have offered to share their homes with a Ukrainian, but data show that a far lower proportion have directly sponsored an individual to come to the UK than is the case south of the border. It was originally planned that those arriving through the Super Sponsor route would be put up in hotels or university halls temporarily, before being placed with a host family. The scheme meant the SNP Government, rather than an individual host, spon sored a Ukrainian's visa. However, some people who applied to take in a refugee several weeks ago are still waiting to be vetted by Scottish councils to ensure that a property is suitable. Others who have been vetted are still waiting to hear whether they have been accepted, MSPs have said. The Daily Telegraph revealed yesterday that the crisis has become so severe that SNP ministers are also considering issuing a formal plea to the British Army to help provide accommodation. ""The Scottish Government's handling of the refugee scheme has been an unmitigated disaster,"" Alex Cole-Hamilton, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said. ""The scale of this humanitarian challenge has been clear for months but Scottish Government pledges have frequently outrun the practicalities. ""We need a fresh push on securing volunteer hosts and more money for vetting them as soon as possible. Unless this is resolved swiftly there will be real questions over whether the ministers in charge should remain in place or whether fresh leadership is required."" A huge cruise ship has been hired in Edinburgh to house Ukrainians and the Scottish Government is believed to be searching for a second vessel, which would be situated on the Clyde. According to the latest figures, only around 10,000 Ukrainians have arrived under the Super Sponsor route, but almost 20,000 more have been granted permission to come to Scotland under the scheme, before it was axed last month. Several hundred per week are believed to be arriving. Miles Briggs, the Scottish Tory MSP, said he had been contacted by several of his constituents in Edinburgh who had offered to share their homes but had not yet been approved because of problems with vetting.

""They have been aware of these issues for some time but have failed to put in place the help and support needed. ""The First Minister needs to get a grip of this situation urgently as people are being left in limbo. I have heard from willing hosts still waiting to be vetted, while others have been visited but then not heard any thing else. It is a dysfunctional scheme."" The Scottish Government has insisted its cruise ship in Leith has been popular with refugees, despite it having windowless rooms which at capacity would be more cramped than prison cells.

The Daily Telegraph understands that Scottish Government officials have discussed the unusual step of making a military aid to civil authorities (MACA) request to the Ministry of Defence, due to fears thousands of refugees will arrive in Scotland with nowhere to go. Meanwhile, the Scottish Government is also believed to be exploring hiring a second cruise ship, based on the Clyde, despite controversy over housing Ukrainians in windowless rooms on a vessel in Edinburgh. Discussions about the MACA are believed to have taken place between Scottish and UK Government staff. Almost 30,000 visas have been issued under the ""super sponsor"" initiative, but despite fewer than 9,000 arriving in Scotland as of last week, there is a lack of housing for them. The scheme was axed last month and the Scottish Government is ""exploring all options"" to solve the crisis. Monica Lennon, the Scottish Labour MSP, said: ""These developments show just how badly the Scottish Govern ment has handled the 'super sponsor' scheme. Ukrainian families deserve the best possible accommodation and support, rather than the half-baked measures the SNP is currently offering. ""SNP ministers must get a grip of this crisis and ensure people seeking sanctuary are treated with dignity."" MoD officials are believed to be braced for a formal request from the Scottish Government, but there is confusion within the UK Government about what meaningful help the Army could give as it does not have a large amount of spare accommodation in Scottish barracks. The Scottish Government has previously warned that councils could be forced to place refugees in ""camp beds in community settings"" due to a lack of suitable accommodation. Ms Sturgeon suggested UK Government ministers lacked humanity by failing to do enough to provide visas to Ukrainian refugees and successfully pushed for her administration to be allowed to directly ""sponsor"" applications to come to the UK. It meant individuals would be granted a visa more quickly as they would not have to wait to be matched with an individual willing to share their homes, with responsibility falling on the Scottish Government to find them temporary accommodation until a more permanent solution was found. SNP ministers have provided £5million to refurbish disused high-rises in Lanarkshire, which had been due to be demolished, in a bid to bring 200 flats back into use. Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, said: ""The collapse of the 'super sponsor' scheme is a gross betrayal by the SNP and we need to get it up and running again - but not by cutting more corners on accommodation. The SNP's decision to house refugees on a cruise ship was a disgrace, and it beggars belief that they are doubling down on this shameful plan.

It has also emerged that a complaint was made to the Scottish Government by a member of the public who raised concern over claims about the number of Ukrainians being accommodated. Scottish Government officials ruled that the ministerial code of conduct had not been breached but told the complainant that ""the relevant policy officials have been informed about the details of your correspondence and will revise future statements to more clearly reflect the nuanced position and avoid any ambiguity"". The First Minister stated in March that more than 23,000 displaced people from Ukraine had arrived in Scotland since the UK Government opened a fast-track visa corridor in March 2022. Nicola Sturgeon, his predecessor, made a similar claim in February, stating that Scotland had so far welcomed ""more than 23,000 Ukrainians into our communities"". This is supported by UK Government figures showing 26,039 refugees with a Scottish sponsor have so far arrived from Ukraine. Of these, 20,594 have been sponsored by the Scottish Government and 5,445 have been sponsored by private individuals. But the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities publishes separate data on support funding for Scottish councils under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.

Krish Kandiah, the founder of Sanctuary Foundation , the charity behind the petition, was accompanied by Ukrainian refugees including nine-year-old Danylo from Kyiv, who knocked on 10 Downing Street to deliver the petition on Tuesday. The petition comes as more than 100,000 people have become guests of British families under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. But as many six-month hosting arrangements come to an end, Ukrainians are struggling to find accommodation in the social housing and private rental sectors, a situation compounded by the cost of living crisis. “We can’t say to the Ukrainian government that we’re standing with them if we’re not adequately caring for women and children who are here,” said Kandiah, who is one of many hosts who together have provided accommodation for more than 10,000 refugees, calling on the government to “meet the compassion of the public” with practical solutions. The petition asks the government for clarity on the rematching and rehosting process, to make local authorities guarantors for rental properties and consider increasing the monthly “thank you” payment given to hosts, among other considerations.

He added that with today’s perspective, Berlin’s adherence to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, despite Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, contributed to the outbreak of war in Ukraine. deltrWir stehen fest an der Seite der ????.

Olena Zelenska was visiting the UK parliament where she gave a speech to a private audience that included former prime minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Keir Starmer, in which she called for British support in creating a Nuremberg-style tribunal. “We need to start the special tribunal against the crime of aggression of Russia against Ukraine, which will enhance the work of the ICC [International Criminal Court] and not weaken it,” Zelenska said. We need to unite the world community just as it happened in January 1942 to support the special tribunal against the aggression of Russia against Ukraine. I’m asking you a small favour to become the world leader in the justice efforts.

Photograph: James Manning/PA  The first lady also visited a special photographic exhibition set up in parliament documenting Russian war crimes against civilians, supported by the Pinchuk Foundation, which is designed to rally support among British parliamentarians to support the creation of an international tribunal, which would require the support of the UN and several key states. Some of the pictures in the exhibition are graphic, although carefully screened from passing viewers. “Every torturer in this war has his face too I really want you to look at those photographs,” Zelenska said. “Then your abstract idea of the war in Ukraine will become real.”  Bjorn Geldhof, the curator of the exhibition, which will run in parliament for 10 days, said the exhibition was intended to be graphic and uncompromising. He said: People need to start thinking seriously about how to bring these war criminals to justice. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.12pm GMT block-time published-time 5.56pm GMT   Russia accuses US of ‘toxicity and hostility’ after pulling out of nuclear arms talks   Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, has accused the US of “the highest level of toxicity and hostility” and of “a pathological desire to harm our country”.  Her comments came after Russia pulled out of nuclear arms talks with US officials that were due to take place in Cairo this week. Writing on Telegram, Zakharova said Moscow’s decision to postpone the talks had been driven by the poor state of relations with Washington. She wrote: In all areas, we note the highest level of toxicity and hostility from Washington. As part of the all-out hybrid war unleashed against us, almost every US step towards Russia is subject to a pathological desire to harm our country wherever possible. The US state department has said it is “ready to reschedule at the earliest possible date as resuming inspections is a priority for sustaining the treaty as an instrument of stability”. But Zakharova accused Washington of trying to alter the balance of forces under the treaty in a “wholly illegitimate” way by converting or renaming weapons to take them outside the scope of the agreement. She did not provide examples or evidence. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, was cited by state-owned media as saying that Moscow had “no choice” but to postpone the meeting. State news agency Tass quoted him as saying: We were faced with a situation where our American colleagues in a number of areas demonstrated not just an unwillingness to perceive our signals and take into account our priorities but acted in the opposite direction. He added: Of course, there is an effect of what is happening in Ukraine and around it. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.13pm GMT block-time published-time 5.43pm GMT  Germany’s justice minister, Marco Buschmann, said Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure constituted a “terrible war crime”. Moscow was launching a “systematic destruction of the heating and electricity supply” in Ukraine as winter sets in, Buschmann told reporters after hosting talks with his G7 counterparts. “Many people will fall victim to the winter”, he said, adding: War criminals should not and must not be allowed to feel safe anywhere. He added that he was “certain that at the end, we will see war crimes cases at the International Criminal Court against senior Russian leadership too”. block-time published-time 5.23pm GMT   Jailed Belarusian protest leader Maria Kolesnikova ‘in intensive care’  The jailed Belarusian senior opposition leader , Maria Kolesnikava, has been taken to the intensive care of a hospital in the city of Gomel, according to reports. Belarusian opposition politician, Viktor Babariko, posted to Telegram that Kolesnikova, one of the most prominent opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko, was taken to hospital yesterday for unknown reasons. The leader of the Belarusian opposition, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, wrote on Telegram: Awful news. Our dear Masha, we all hope that you are going to be okay! Kolesnikova was sentenced last year to 11 years in prison, after being charged with conspiracy to seize power, calling for action to damage national security, and calling for actions damaging national security using media and the internet. She was one of three women who in 2020 united to lead an uprising in which tens of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets in the largest protests in the country’s modern history. She was arrested and taken to the border, where she was told to leave the country. Instead, she reportedly ripped up her passport, risking prison rather than going into exile. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.51pm GMT block-time published-time 5.02pm GMT  Here are some of the latest images we have received from the frontline in Kherson, southern Ukraine.

He said Ukrainian authorities had told him that they had “pilots” able to operate Nato battle tanks, suggesting some had already undergone commensurate training on alliance territory. “It’s a political decision because from a military perspective during the winter when the frontline is stabilising, if an additional jolt is needed, then this could be achieved by providing extra battle tanks,” he said. Kyiv has repeatedly asked for Nato’s main arms manufacturers to supply them with state-of-the-art tanks as they look to consolidate gains it has made in counter-offensives in recent months, notably in the embattled eastern Donbas region. block-time published-time 4.03pm GMT  Reuters has a quick snap that US president Joe Biden said aid to Ukraine and funding to continue the fight against Covid are his priorities as he convened a meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss legislative actions for the remainder of the year. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 4.13pm GMT block-time published-time 4.00pm GMT   G7 agrees to set up network to coordinate investigations into war crimes in Ukraine   The G7 group agreed on Tuesday to set up a network to coordinate investigations into war crimes, as part of a push to prosecute suspected atrocities in Ukraine.  “Judicial examination of the atrocities committed in Ukraine will take years, perhaps even decades. But we will be well prepared * and we will persist for as long as it takes,” German justice minister Marco Buschmann said in a statement, Reuters reports. It came after a meeting of G7 justice ministers in Berlin, also attended by special prosecutors of the international criminal court, Germany’s federal prosecutor and Ukrainian justice minister Denys Maliuska. In a joint declaration, the ministers said G7 countries would ensure there is a central national contact point in each state for the prosecution of international crimes. Buschmann told reporters this would ensure that information on evidence and legal requirements can be shared among states and international organisations. He added that statements from victims of sexual assault should be recorded in such a way that is admissible in court so that victims would only have to give their statement once. block-time published-time 3.55pm GMT   Summary of the day so far  It’s almost 6pm in Kyiv.

More than 20 million Ukrainians were left without electricity, water and heat as a result of Russian missile strikes, she says, some for more than 30 hours. Ukraine’s first lady says Russia has used “systematic violence” in many occupied towns and villages in Ukraine. Thousands of crimes by Russian forces have been identified, she says, including sexual violence. She says: The youngest girl who was raped by the Russian occupiers was four years old.

She says the British survived the air raids, which were “identical to those that Russia uses now to put us on our knees”. We’re hearing sirens every day. They are identical to those which were heard by British generations. You did not surrender and we will not surrender. But victory is not the only thing we need. We need justice.

Reuters reported that the Kherson official, who was not named in the statement, cooperated with the occupation authorities and helped with the functioning of public services under the Russians, according to the prosecutor. The official, who could not be reached for comment, faces up to 12 years in prison under the allegations if prosecuted and found guilty. The official was in custody, but could post bail, the prosecutor said. Ukraine proclaimed the liberation of Kherson on 11 November after Russian forces who invaded Ukraine in February pulled out of the city in the south of the country and crossed to the other side of the Dnipro River. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.00pm GMT block-time published-time 2.41pm GMT   Pope Francis has sparked fury in Russia over an interview in which he suggested that non-Christian members of its armed forces showed more cruelty in Ukraine than ethnic Russian soldiers.  In an interview with the Catholic magazine America published Monday, the pope said that soldiers from the Buddhist region of Buryatia and the Muslim-majority Chechnya republic were “the cruellest” while fighting in Ukraine. “Generally, the cruellest are perhaps those who are of Russia but are not of the Russian tradition, such as the Chechens, the Buryats and so on,” he said. Russia has disproportionately relied on ethnic minorities to provide its main fighting force in Ukraine.

That was despite a lack of mutual inspections and Russia’s last-minute decision to call off talks of a joint commission this week, Ryabkov added. However, he also signalled to the United States that increasing US involvement in the Ukrainian conflict brings growing risks, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Ryabkov said there was no dialogue between Russia and the United States over Ukraine as the two sides had “radically different positions.” block-time published-time 1.46pm GMT   The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has confirmed that a Zambian national who died in Ukraine had been fighting for his group.  The admission by Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, comes two weeks after Zambia demanded an urgent explanation from Moscow over the death of its citizen.  Lemekhani Nathan Nyirenda, 23, “died a hero” fighting with Russian forces, Prigozhin said on Telegram. He said: Lemekhani Nathan Nyirenda on September 22 was one of the first to break into enemy trenches, showing courage and bravery. Nyirenda father said he had been serving a nine-year jail sentence on the outskirts of Moscow for a drug offence when he was “conscripted” to fight, Reuters reports. His family said it was unclear how he was recruited or by whom. Prigozhin said he “remembered this guy well” and had met Nyirenda on his recruitment drive across Russia’s prisons. He claimed the Zambian willingly agreed to go and fight for Wagner. Prigozhin and other Wagner representatives have toured Russian prisons offering amnesty in return for signing up to fight for Russia in Ukraine. It has not been possible to independently verify the circumstances of Nyirenda’s death or Prigozhin’s assertion that he had joined Wagner voluntarily. block-time published-time 1.18pm GMT   Ukraine’s state energy operator, Ukrenegro, has said it is still struggling to restore full power nearly a week after Russian missile strikes damaged energy facilities across the country.

The figure represents a slight rise from yesterday after emergency shutdowns at several power plants and an increase in consumption as winter sets in. The statement by Ukrenegro added: We emphasise that the general deficit in the energy system is a consequence of seven waves of Russian missile attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.48pm GMT block-time published-time 1.06pm GMT   Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Moscow had been left with “no other choice” but to cancel nuclear weapons talks with the US, state-run news agencies reported.  The US state department yesterday said Russia had “unilaterally postponed” talks about the “New START” nuclear arms reduction treaty, which had been due to start in Cairo this week. Ryabkov claimed Washington had only wanted to discuss resuming inspections while Moscow had other priorities. He was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti as saying: By and large, the situation was such that we had no other choice. The decision was made at the political level. Ryabkov was also quoted by state-owned Tass news agency as adding: The Americans focused exclusively on the topic of resuming inspections... meanwhile the solution of other issues has been and remains a priority for us. We have repeatedly explained our position... but we did not see the slightest desire on the American side to move in this direction. He said it was unlikely any meeting would take place this year. block-time published-time 12.43pm GMT   Ukraine is considering expelling all Russian citizens who came to Crimea after it was annexed by Moscow in 2014, according to a representative of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  In a piece for the Ukrainian newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, Tamila Tasheva, Zelenskiy’s top representative for Crimea, wrote: According to Ukrainian legislation, all foreigners who entered the peninsula after 2014, not through Ukrainian checkpoints or through them, but violated the terms of stay, live in the territory of Crimea illegally. The decision is simple and does not contradict international law: the population that came illegally to the territory of the peninsula must leave the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol through voluntary departure or forced expulsion. She added that current Ukrainian legislation also provides for the possibility of forced return of foreigners and stateless persons, although it cannot currently be applied to temporarily occupied territories. Tasheva also wrote that Ukraine does not recognise passports that Russia “forcibly” distributed to residents of the Crimea peninsula under its occupation, adding: All of them were and remain citizens of Ukraine. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.05pm GMT block-time published-time 12.22pm GMT   Russia appears to be planning big air attacks, says security analyst  Russian forces appear to be planning “some quite big air attacks” in Ukraine”, according to a security and defence analyst.

There’s a lot of Twitter chat and satellite imagery at air bases … so there may be a lot of air activity. He added that Moscow’s troops were making “some progress” in the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut, and were “really digging in for winter”.

Contrary to the prime minister's claims to be leading the world in the economic response to the invasion of Ukraine , there is frustration among allies over the UK's lethargy in hitting Russian wealth. The government is being urged in behind-the-scenes discussions with the EU to target more named individuals believed to be sheltering their wealth in London property and financial structures. That private frustration was made public in comments from Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's first vice-president on Thursday. ""I don't hesitate to say this,"" Timmermans told the BBC. ""The UK is now following our lead. And I'm sure they will continue to follow the lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this.

The Foreign Office has for days been promising to publish a schedule of oligarchs it will hit, but as yet just eight such individuals with links to Vladimir Putin have been listed.

The chair of the Commons defence committee told the PA news agency:  We should leave no stone unturned in isolating these oligarchs from their investments, including the seizure of properties and yachts. There's a race to squeeze Putin given the war crimes he's now committing in Ukraine, and London continues to be seen as ground zero as to where oligarchs' investments sit. So we need to be impounding these assets in days, not weeks or months. There's going to be increasing public anger that we're not doing enough to help our fellow Ukrainians in their hour of need. I would agree with Tom [Tugendhat]; I simply would add what we do must be legally watertight, what we can't see is any loopholes. Every day we wait offers more time for the oligarchs to move their wealth to other parts of the world.

While highlighting the ""significant action"" taken by the government on sanctions, Labour former minister Lord Foulkes of Cumnock said:  But there is one further sanction which has not yet been considered ... and that is using the powers we have to remove British citizenship from Putin oligarchs living in the United Kingdom. Lord Ahmad said:  We are looking at the full picture. But equally I would stress the point there are many Russians in the United Kingdom who are dual nationals, there are many Russians who don't have citizenship but who are residing in the UK, there are many Russians in Russia ... who are totally and utterly against Mr Putin and his government and it's important we stand by them as well. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.55pm GMT block-time published-time 1.16pm GMT   PM under pressure to move faster in targeting assets of Russian oligarch   Boris Johnson is under pressure to go faster in targeting Russian oligarchs, after it was conceded it could take ""weeks and months"" to build legally-sound cases, PA reports.

But there have been questions over why billionaires such as Roman Abramovich, who has announced he will sell Chelsea FC, have not been hit with sanctions. A government source acknowledged to the PA news agency it could take ""weeks and months"" to build a legally watertight case against some Russian oligarchs. ""We're working round the clock and going as quick as we can,"" the source added. Downing Street sought to downplay the issue, with the prime minister's official spokesman insisting:  We are not being held back from introducing sanctions. But he said ""we do have laws that we need to abide by"" when applying the economic restrictions. He added:  When it comes to individuals it is the case that we need to do the preparatory work, the requisite work, to make sure it is legally sound before introduction.  Like I said, we will keep that under review and if there are ways to further speed it up then we will. He also sought to argue that sanctions on the banks funding the Russian president's military machine will exert more pressure than going after his wealthy allies. He said: Our judgment is placing sanctions particularly on large banks and companies ... that is what we believe will exert the most pressure on Putin's regime and will throttle off funding for this illegal war against Ukraine. But Tugendhat, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, called for the government to go further to follow European allies to seize oligarchs' assets. He told PA: We should be looking immediately to seize those assets linked to those who are profiting from Putin's war machine, holding it in trust and returning it to the Russian people as soon as possible. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.11pm GMT block-time published-time 12.55pm GMT   While FMQs in the Scottish parliament this lunchtime has been dominated by domestic issues, there was inevitable discussion of the Ukraine crisis.  On the subject of refugees, Nicola Sturgeon told the Holyrood chamber that there was a ""moral, humanitarian obligation"" to help those fleeing the war, adding that she wanted to ""appeal directly to the prime minister to follow the example of the European Union and allow anyone fleeing the horror of Ukraine entry to the UK if they wish and deal with the paperwork later"". Sturgeon also pledged action on oligarchs in Scotland, after Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer challenged her about close Putin associate Vladimir Lisin, who has received hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of agricultural subsidies for his 3000 acre estate in Scotland. Sturgeon said there would be an immediate review of such schemes, adding:  I have sought urgent advice on the maximum possible action the Scottish government can take against individuals or entities identifying as having close links with the Russian regime ... including ending support from the public purse and freezing assets. She said that her government was also writing to Scottish businesses encouraging them to review and sever links with Russia.  block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.59pm GMT block-time published-time 12.35pm GMT   No 10 lobby briefing - key points  Here are some key points from this afternoon's Downing Street lobby briefing:  No 10 denied the Foreign Office has been held back from issuing sanctions against Russian oligarchs because officials are struggling to prove reasonable grounds. The PM's official spokesperson said:  I wouldn't recognise that. We are not being held back from introducing sanctions. We've gone further and faster than we ever have done before but we do have laws that we need to abide when it comes to how we apply these sanctions and we are following them. As you would expect we keep under constant review whether or not we can do more to allow us to go even faster.  Downing Street said sanctioning large banks and companies is what will ""throttle off funding"" for the Russian invasion and is more effective than targeting oligarchs. The spokesperson said:  When it comes to individuals it is the case that we need to do the preparatory work, the requisite work, to make sure it is legally sound before introduction. Like I said, we will keep that under review and if there are ways to further speed it up then we will. I wouldn't want people to get lost on the fact of just focusing on individuals. Obviously what is important is what puts the most pressure on Putin's regime. Our judgment is placing sanctions particularly on large banks and companies ... that is what we believe will exert the most pressure on Putin's regime and will throttle off funding for this illegal war against Ukraine.  Downing Street denied it could take months to prove the grounds to sanction some Russian oligarchs under measures to apply pressure on the Putin regime. The spokesperson said: I don't recognise that, certainly; I think we've said we're bringing sanctions against more individuals including 571 members of the Duma and Federation Council. We've been working on some of these sanctions in weeks and you will see more and more individuals added to that list as it grows. Asked if it could be weeks, he responded:  You will see over the coming days and weeks more and more sanctions come in.  Downing Street said it was key that actions taken against Russia were those which put pressure on Vladimir Putin and his regime. The PM's official spokesperson was asked about steps such as the cancellation of the Trans-Siberian exhibition at the Science Museum, and whether those actions were going too far and hitting normal Russians. He said: We do want to be very clear with the Russian people, many of whom are incredibly bravely demonstrating on the streets of Russia, I think more than a million people signed a petition in Russia against the war, which is very brave given the authoritarian regime there. Our issue is not with the Russian people. We understand that ... I'm sure that companies and businesses are trying to act in good faith here. But he added:  I think what's important is to make sure that the actions that we take are done to exert pressure on Putin and his regime, rather than inflict any necessary pain on the Russian people. Asked if Imperial Fabergé eggs on loan to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from the Kremlin should be kept in the UK until the conflict was resolved, the spokesman said he was ""not aware of our position on Fabergé eggs"".  No 10 said the government had not been formally notified of the sale of Chelsea Football Club. The spokesperson was asked whether there were steps being taken to ensure Chelsea and Everton could continue to operate if their Russian owners were sanctioned. He said:  It is early days on some of these things. As I say, we formally haven't had any notice on triggering the sale of Chelsea, which has been reported. But he added:  We do have options available to us in extremis. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.04pm GMT block-time published-time 12.04pm GMT   Nadine Dorries has also told MPs she has called on Unesco to bar Russia from hosting its annual world heritage conference in June.  The culture secretary said that if it goes ahead, the UK ""will not be attending"". It's why I called on Unesco to bar Russia from hosting its annual world heritage conference in June. It's absolutely inconceivable that this event could go ahead in Putin's country as he fires missiles at innocent civilians in neighbouring Ukraine. If it does go ahead, the UK will not be attending. And it's why I urged the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) yesterday to urgently rethink its decision to allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to compete. This pressure works. The IPC's decision was the wrong call. And I welcome the fact that overnight they have listened and have reversed that decision this morning. block-time published-time 11.49am GMT   Ofcom reviewing whether to revoke Russia Today's broadcast licence entirely, Nadine Dorries says   Nadine Dorries also said that Ofcom is now reviewing whether to revoke Russia Today's broadcast licence entirely.  The culture secretary told the Commons that Vladimir Putin ""must not be allowed to exploit our open and free media to spread poisonous propaganda into British homes"". She added:  And that is why I wrote to Ofcom last week urging them to examine any potential breaches of the broadcasting code. Ofcom has since opened 27 investigations into RT, and they are now reviewing whether to revoke RT's licence entirely. In the meantime, those investigations have been taken over by events and I was very glad to see yesterday that the channel is now officially off air on British televisions, after it shut down on Sky, Freeview and Freesat. block-time published-time 11.48am GMT   Reiterating what she wrote for the Telegraph (paywall) on Wednesday, Nadine Dorries has told MPs Vladimir Putin is ""suffering a sporting and cultural Siberia"" that will be causing him ""real pain"".  She said that culture was ""the third front"" in the war in Ukraine, as she outlined the sporting and cultural bans that Russia had faced. The culture secretary told the Commons:  Putin is now suffering a sporting and cultural Siberia of its own making, and it will be causing the Russian leader real pain. Dorries said she had recently made the UK's position on Russia's participation in international sports events clear to sports bodies, telling them:  Russia should be stripped of hosting international sporting events and Russian teams should not be allowed to compete abroad.  Across sports, across the arts and entertainment we are ostracising Putin off the global stage. block-time published-time 11.29am GMT   The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, told a press conference in Lithuania that we must go further with sanctions against Russia as 'Putin must fail'. Photograph: AP  block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.32pm GMT block-time published-time 11.02am GMT  Truss was also asked at the press conference what can be done to achieve a ""humanitarian corridor"" to help people fleeing Ukraine, and ensure medical supplies reach the most vulnerable. She told reporters in Lithuania:  Well, you are absolutely right about the dire situation, and the United Kingdom has sent teams to the border to assist, particularly in Poland, but also in other countries facing those issues. I was in Geneva ... the day before yesterday, meeting the UN and others to talk about making sure a humanitarian corridor is established for the safe passage of aid and humanitarian support. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.21am GMT block-time published-time 10.54am GMT   Liz Truss has said the west needs to ""get the information"" to the Russian people about what is ""actually happening"" in Ukraine in the face of reports from state-owned media at home.  The UK foreign secretary told the press conference in Lithuania she did not believe that president Vladimir Putin ""speaks on behalf of Russian people"". She said:  What we have seen over the last week is some very brave people in Russia protesting, standing up against the regime. And we need to make sure that we get the information to them about what is actually happening. It is much harder to control information in the world of social media. And we need to make sure, as I've said, that the Russian economy is crippled so it is unable to continue to fund Putin and the war machine. And I suspect that the Russian people will draw their own conclusions from that. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.23am GMT block-time published-time 10.40am GMT  Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics, is speaking now. He says we must continue supporting Ukraine in any way we can, diplomatically, politically, economically and militarily. We must stop Russia from further aggression, through sanctions and diplomatic pressure, he says. We need to close loopholes and continue to apply further economic sanctions against Russia, but the same sanctions must be applied to Belarus which is complicit and could be used by Russia to avoid some of the harshest effects of sanctions, he says. We must respond in terms of regional security in eastern flank nations, he says. We all understand we will see such challenging situations as long as there is the current leadership in Russia so we must be prepared for a very long engagement, he says. block-time published-time 10.36am GMT  Estonia's foreign minister Eva-Maria Liimets is speaking now. We must continue to support Ukraine politically, financially and to defend their sovereignty and the lives of their people, she says. Ukraine is on the frontline protecting European values, she says, adding we must support its candidacy to join the EU. To help stop the war, we must continue to raise the cost of war for Russia, she says. We must use all political means to hold the aggressor accountable for war crimes, she says. block-time published-time 10.31am GMT   'We must keep our foot on the gas' with sanctions against Russia, Truss says  The UK was the first European country to give defensive military support to Ukraine and is the top European donor, pledging £200m in humanitarian aid support to Ukraine, Truss says. We've also been at the forefront in sanctions against Russia and it's vital that we keep our foot on the gas, she says. We need to go further, making sure no Russian bank has access to Swift and reducing dependency on hydrocarbons from Russia including oil, gas and coal, she says. Truss says she will raise these issues at the G7 on Friday and at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. She says this is a struggle not just for Ukraine's freedom and self-determination, but for all of our freedom and security. By continuing to respond with strengths we will together ensure that Putin loses, she says. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.24am GMT block-time published-time 10.25am GMT   'We must ensure Putin fails,' Truss says  The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is speaking now. We must ensure Putin fails, she says. She says she admires the courage of the Baltic states who have long lived in the shadow of Russian aggression. We have two clear objectives, she says. First, Putin must lose in Ukraine and we're helping Ukraine with defensive weapons to stop Russian tanks but we need to do more, she says.  Second, we're reinforcing Nato's eastern flank and supporting European security through the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force, she says. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.06am GMT block-time published-time 10.20am GMT  Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis is talking now. He says they have discussed ways to support Ukraine, including financial support for Ukraine and economic sanctions against Russia, and these cannot be ""half steps"". He says it also must not be forgotten that Belarus is a counterpart in Russia's aggression. block-time published-time 10.16am GMT  As I mentioned earlier, Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, is giving a joint press conference at the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, alongside Estonian foreign minister Eva-Maria Liimets, Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics and Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.  It's about to begin, there will soon be a live stream at the top of the blog.

A senior government source told PA that Javid has been in talks with NHS England over ending the contracts, which are reported by Politico to have been worth 16 million in 2021. More than a dozen NHS trusts are thought to be supplied by Gazprom, alongside several local councils. The source told PA:  Sajid has spoken with NHSE and been clear that trusts need to stop using Gazprom as a supplier. He has also requested a wider review of any Russian role in supply chains across the health service. It comes after Lord Simon Stevens, former head of NHS England, told the House of Lords that ""decarbonising the health sector will take pound notes out of the hands of dictatorial regimes that are engaged in acts of aggression"". The Tory former health secretary Jeremy Hunt also tweeted: It's clearly unsustainable for a humanitarian organisation like the NHS to have any commercial links whatsoever with Putin's murderous regime. block-time published-time 10.03am GMT   Lib Dems call for Putin-linked oligarchs' UK homes to be seized and used for Ukrainian refugees   The Liberal Democrats have written to ministers to formally demand the UK government seizes homes owned by oligarchs with close links to Vladimir Putin, and that in the short term they are used to house Ukrainian refugees.   Alistair Carmichael, the party's home affairs spokesman, told Priti Patel, the home secretary, it was ""time to freeze these assets and put them to good use"", saying this would also help keep Ukrainian refugees out of hotels or other unsuitable accommodation. In the letter, Carmichael called for quicker action to sanction Putin-linked oligarchs:  It is time to sanction them all - and freeze their assets, including any property they own in the UK. These properties should then be used to house any Ukrainian refugees, on a temporary basis, while they await permanent resettlement. Rather than languishing in hotel rooms - or worse, unsuitable barracks, we should be putting Putin's cronies' assets to good use. Unlike the government and Labour, the Liberal Democrats have called for a comprehensive scheme to bring Ukrainian refugees to the UK, calling for a five-year funding plan for councils which take them. block-time published-time 10.00am GMT   There is 'every indication Putin is absolutely guilty of war crimes', Hinds says   Damian Hinds has said there is ""every indication Vladimir Putin is absolutely guilty"" of war crimes.  Welcoming the International Criminal Court (ICC) opening an investigation after Russia was referred by Britain and 37 allies, the UK security minister told LBC:  As the prime minister said the other day, there is every indication Vladimir Putin is absolutely guilty. But it is also really important that not only he, but the generals, the officers in his army, know that evidence is being gathered and that people can be held to account through the international justice system. block-time published-time 9.54am GMT   Damian Hinds said it would ""be neither right nor wise"" to comment on Roman Abramovich, after the Chelsea owner announced his intention to sell the Premier League football club.  The security minister, asked on ITV's Good Morning Britain whether sanctions against the Russian billionaire were being considered, said:  It would be neither right nor wise of me to comment on individuals. I don't think we should let individuals know what is going to happen before it happens. But in any case, I wouldn't talk about an individual case unless and until there were measures in place. But people should know we've already put in place sanctions on individuals and there will be more to come. Asked whether he knew what Abramovich meant when he said ""net proceeds"" from the sale of the club would go to the victims of the war in Ukraine, Hinds said:  No, because you can define net proceeds in different ways, as any corporate financier would tell you. block-time published-time 9.49am GMT   The wealth of Russian oligarchs with British investments will not prevent the UK government from ""going after"" them, Damian Hinds said this morning.  Put to him that Boris Johnson 's administration is ""scared"" of targeting wealthy Russian elites due to the ""legal implications"", Hinds told BBC Breakfast:  No. You shouldn't overlook or just ignore what I just said about people who have already been sanctioned - that is very material in these circumstances. And there will be more individuals [who] can be sanctioned. And we do understand some of these are deep-pocketed people - that doesn't mean they are immune or exempt in any way. We will be going after people as needed. Hinds also appeared to suggest the UK could look to seize assets of Russian oligarchs as part of its next sanctioning steps. Told on LBC that German authorities had seized Alisher Usmanov's yacht and asked whether similar action on elite Russians should be taken in Britain, Hinds said:  Yeah. And look, we are going to go further. We've acted very quickly on the initial round of sanctions - that includes individuals as well as organisations, banks and so on - but we've always been clear it is a ratchet approach and there can be more to come. Specifically on assets, we've got legislation going through parliament at the moment - we're debating it on Monday - to include bolstering unexplained wealth orders, which are a potentially potent tool that can open investigations to lead to the proceeds of crime being seized. We need to gum up that system, we need to stop it, to stop the money laundering, but also, as you rightly say, where it is possible - and obviously we operate within a legal framework - we are absolutely motivated to seize the proceeds of crime. block-time published-time 9.47am GMT   More from the morning interviews with the security minister Damian Hinds, who said there is no suggestion of delay in helping Ukrainian refugees, with a further UK scheme to open on Friday.  Hinds said he wanted to make sure those fleeing the Russian invasion had the ""warmest, most supportive welcome possible"" in Britain. He said as well as a ""couple of hundred thousand"" entering via the extended family programme - which will be open to applications on Friday - others would be eligible via a ""community sponsorship route"", along with already established schemes. He told Sky News: There is absolutely no suggestion of any kind of delay here - people need help now. Asked how many visa applications had been submitted since last Wednesday, Hinds said:  So far a relatively small number - I can't give you an exact number - but we expect that to grow rapidly. So we are stepping up the capacity. We are very soon up to capacity for 6,000, and we will keep that under review and if it needs to increase, it will increase - and that's just in the immediate region. There is also of course application centres across Europe. block-time published-time 9.43am GMT   The UK defence secretary said the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine will ""ripple through Europe"" for ""years to come"" as he called on president Vladimir Putin to call off the conflict.  Ben Wallace, speaking at a press conference in Estonia, said: The message to Putin is: Stop. It isn't too late to stop what you are doing. What you have done so far is illegal and you risk being isolated for decades to come. He added:  This hasn't finished here. The consequences of what we are seeing in Ukraine will ripple through Europe and Nato for not just weeks but months and years to come. Answering a question from a reporter, he said it would ""be very hard for the international community to engage"" with Putin ""in the long-term"" following his invasion of a ""sovereign country at huge scale, inflicting huge damage and violence"". Wallace said the idea of having a ""normal relationship with the Russian government"" would be ""almost impossible as a result of what we have seen in Ukraine unless president Putin chooses to cease what he is doing now"". block-time published-time 9.28am GMT   Culture is ""the third front in the Ukrainian war"", Nadine Dorries has said, as the cabinet minister said sporting sanctions could hit as hard as economic measures on Russia.  Writing in the Telegraph (paywall) on Wednesday, Dorries said she was using the ""full might of the UK's soft power"" to make Russian president Vladimir Putin an ""international pariah"". Dorries is set to host sports ministers from the US, Australia, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Latvia, Italy, Finland, Czech Republic, Norway and Canada on Thursday, to mobilise more support to isolate Russia from the global sporting arena. It comes as Russian and Belarusian athletes will be banned from the Beijing Winter Paralympics after the International Paralympic Committee reversed its original decision.  Read more on that here: Russian and Belarusian athletes banned from Winter Paralympics after U-turn Dorries wrote:  Putin is now suffering a sporting and cultural Siberia of his own making. These are not mere gestures. Culture and sport matter - to Putin, to his cronies and to the Russian people. The culture secretary said that already the Champions League and Formula One Grand Prix had moved from Russia, and Fifa, Uefa, World Rugby, the International Tennis Federation and the International Olympic Committee had banned Russia and Russian teams from competitions. She also highlighted that the Eurovision song contest had banned Russia's participation. This list now also includes the International Paralympic Committee. Dorries wrote: This sporting exile will be causing the Russian leader real pain. The virtual ministers' summit on Thursday will have three aims: to agree that Russia and Belarus are stripped from hosting any international sporting events, ensure teams and individuals are banned from international competition, and to take ""tough action on sport-related investment with links to the Russian state"". block-time published-time 9.24am GMT  The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will give a joint press conference at 10.15am GMT at the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, alongside Estonian foreign minister Eva-Maria Liimets, Latvian foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics and Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.

Nearly £2m is to be spent on 31 hubs across 27 local authorities, the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities said. Hubs are already up and running at airports including at Luton, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, and at St Pancras International train station in London. The centres will provide food, clothing and sanitary products to arrivals, act as a space for matched families to meet one another and help Ukrainians travel onward to their accommodation. Emergency £200 cash grants will also be available for those who need them. The move comes as refugee campaigners voice despair at slow progress, red tape and disparity between the UK and EU's approach to the crisis. Official figures show that as of Wednesday, more than two weeks after the launch of the government's much-vaunted Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, only 2,700 visas had been granted under it.  The UK has granted 25,500 visas to Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of March, 22,800 of which have been issued to people hoping to join relatives in the UK under the Ukraine Family scheme. More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia invaded in February, the vast majority settling in Poland, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. About 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. Leading charities have called on the government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees as a short-term measure to bring the UK in line with the EU. The Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam said the visa system was ""causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians"". The government is giving councils £10,500 a person under the Homes for Ukraine scheme to cover arrival costs, safeguarding inspections and access to public services. Up to £8,755 in additional funding is available per child for education. The refugees minister, Richard Harrington, said: ""The response of the British public has been incredible, opening their hearts and homes to the people of Ukraine. ""Welcome hubs at airports and train stations right across the country stand ready to aid Ukrainians and their families as soon as they arrive in the UK. ""Together with the British public, we are doing everything in our power to ensure Ukrainians arrive safely and are supported to rebuild their lives here.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,1,Aid
1476,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,4/3/2022,718 words,Philip Oltermann in Berlin,'Tip of the iceberg': Berliners rally to welcome refugees from Ukraine,"When Iman Abdikarim joined a WhatsApp group to help Ukrainian refugees on a whim earlier this week, it had only 17 members and only vague ideas of what it might do. By Friday morning, the medical student was directing a chaotic throng of arrivals inside Berlin's main station, as Germany's ""welcome culture"" returned to the foreground. The WhatsApp group now has almost 8,000 volunteers and is central to efforts to provide refugees with temporary accommodation, food and clothes. ""I've been working 10 hours every day this week, and I've got to work shifts at the clinic at night,"" said the 27-year-old with Somali roots in an upbeat tone. ""But we are learning what the people who come here need."" Her mobile phone buzzes every few seconds with new messages, some of them from Ukraine, others from more Berliners who want to help. Behind her back, another volunteer coordinator shouts into a megaphone: ""If you speak Russian or Ukrainian, stay. If you don't, please come back tonight."" Scenes at Berlin's central station mirror those from the summer of 2015, when large parts of German civic society rallied to aid asylum seekers arriving from Syria. In terms of sheer numbers, however, the challenge is starker: at the height of the influx of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, authorities in Berlin had to coordinate shelter for about 700 people and struggled, temporarily repurposing sports halls. This Thursday alone, 6,500 refugees arrived in the city by train, according to Berlin's senator for social affairs. In each of the previous two days more than 1,000 people have arrived. Operator Deutsche Bahn, which has been handing out free travel tickets to refugees from Ukraine, says it has doubled its number of direct trains to the Polish border. ""We have to prepare for the fact that the largest movement of refugees since the end of the second world war is headed for Europe,"" said senator Katja Kipping. ""What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg."" The hope in Germany's administrative apparatus is that relaxed visa rules will avoid bottleneck situations: since 2017, Ukrainians with biometric passports have been able to travel to the Schengen zone and stay for 90 days out of every 180 without needing a visa. Sixteen-year-old Viktor Levchenko arrived at Berlin central station on Friday morning, with his mother and cousin, having left Kyiv 48 hours before. Carrying a backpack each and a paper bag with basic supplies such as flour, toilet rolls and soap given to them by volunteers, they waited on the cold ground floor of the station for a Berlin-based Ukrainian friend to pick them up and host them for a few days. ""We are working out what to do,"" Levchenko said. ""For now, we must stay in Germany. But afterwards, we must go back."" After arriving in Berlin, they called his aunt and uncle who had stayed behind in Kyiv to serve in the military. As they were speaking over the phone, they could hear air-raid sirens in the background. Even before Vladimir Putin's army started its incursion on to Ukrainian soil last week, asylum applications in Germany had risen to a four-year high in 2021, following a drop during the first year of the pandemic. As shelters in the capital were close to full capacity at the start of the year, the senate proposed renting empty hotels and hostels on an ad hoc basis. On Friday, Kipping said the city was planning to erect a tent outside the central station that would provide temporary resting places and sanitary facilities to those arriving from Ukraine before they were transported by shuttle buses to shelters in Berlin or nearby cities like Leipzig. But until now, the brunt of the aid effort has been facilitated by volunteers, such as Mirjam König, who was waiting by the side of arrival point at Hauptbahnhof with her toddler son on her arm. A cardboard sign rested on the buggy next to her, saying: ""One room for woman with 1/2 children."" König said she had posted her offer of a room on a volunteering website three days earlier but did not get a response. ""Maybe it's more practical this way,"" she said, while bouncing her son in her arms. ""I wanted to exhaust all my options."" ""If something like this happened to me, I would hope there will be people offering me their help too. When injustice happens on this Earth, you want to do something about it.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Aid

Olena Said, who manages clinical trials at King's College London, applied to move to the UK days before the Russian invasion but her application has been tied up in red tape. She applied on 17 February under a priority scheme meant to fast track skilled workers under the UK's post-Brexit points-based immigration system. However, she is still waiting for a decision. Said, 38, and her 74-year-old mother fled to neighbouring Moldova six weeks ago after their region of Odesa was one of the first places bombed by the Russians. She said: ""I feel profoundly let down by the whole system. It just feels like it is stuck in limbo somewhere and there's no way to know what is the truth any more."" Said, who has a PhD in clinical pharmacology, manages a clinical trial on the treatment of eating disorders at King's College London's Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, where she has worked since August 2021. Dr Hubertus Himmerich, a clinical senior lecturer who works with Said at KCL, said the trial she was running ""might lead to a scientific and medical breakthrough"" in the pharmacological treatment of anorexia nervosa. He added: ""It is heartbreaking that a highly qualified medical researcher like Lena is currently not allowed to enter the UK and is prevented from continuing research that might save young lives. Said came to the UK in September 2020 on a student visa to complete a master's at University College London. She had to return temporarily to Ukraine in January when her student visa expired. She then applied for a skilled worker visa, sponsored by King's College, to move to the UK permanently. Now stuck in the Moldovan capital, Chi?inau, Said said she was ""trying to survive day to day"". She and her British partner, Richard Beenham, have tried to find out the status of her visa but have been given conflicting responses from junior UK visas and immigration officials. She said: ""It's a massive disgrace. I'm checking my emails probably thousands of times a day just in the hope that I can go back to the place where I have what resembles a normal life and not stuck in a country where there is nothing for me, no work, no family. It feels incredibly isolating and devastating that [there is a] lack of caring from people who have the power to direct how someone's life goes."" Official figures show that, as of last Thursday, the UK has issued visas to 45% of the 65,000 Ukrainians who have applied under two schemes. However, under the much-vaunted Homes for Ukraine scheme, which matches strangers in the UK with people in Ukraine, only 4,700 visas have been issued of the 32,200 applications. Leading charities have called on the government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees as a short-term measure to bring the UK in line with the EU. More than 4.2 million Ukrainians have fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion, according to the UN's refugee agency. About 6.5 million people are displaced internally within Ukraine. Kate Larmer, who co-founded Farnham Homes for Ukraine to match those fleeing war with homes in Surrey, said the UK's ""heinous"" visa requirements were adding to people's emotional distress. Her group has submitted 136 visa applications on behalf of Ukrainians, including dozens of children, but only six have been issued, she said. Most of the 136 have been waiting for more than two weeks, and a ""significant proportion"" for more than three weeks. A government spokesperson said it was ""moving as quickly as possible"" to get Ukrainians to the UK. He added: ""We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK, simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers, while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. ""We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes, with almost 30,000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,0,Migration
1551,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,9/5/2022,903 words,Ashifa Kassam in Girona,'It was happy and sad': sisters reunited after 20 years by war in Ukraine,"A cry of joy rang out as the two young women - one reeling from a 34-hour trek out of Ukraine and the other just off a late-night work shift - spotted each other on a pavement in Catalonia. The reunion had been decades in the making, the final details hastily hashed out as Russian tanks rolled on to the streets of Ukraine. ""The moment was both happy and sad,"" said Angelika Batiai, 24. ""Here I was seeing my sister again after 20 years, but on the other hand I had just left my family and friends in a country at war."" The half-sisters had spent the first years of their lives together in the southern Ukrainian village of Nikolaev, leaning on each other as they grew up with only an absentee mother to care for them. Family problems left them separated soon after; five-year-old Angelika was sent to live with an aunt and Tatyana, six, with a grandmother before ending up in state care. They begged to be kept together, recalled Tatyana Kluge García, 25. ""But economically it was impossible, Angelika's aunt couldn't afford to take us both in."" At the age of eight, Tatyana was adopted by a family in the Spanish city of Girona, near Barcelona, trading her arduous beginning for a new family, country and slate of languages. Even as her command of Ukrainian faded, her sister remained constantly in her thoughts. ""I always said that I would go to Ukraine and find her,"" said Tatyana. As a teenager she scoured social media for any trace of her sister, even downloading the Russian social network VK at one point. More than 2,000 miles away in Ukraine, Angelika was doing the same. When she stumbled across a Facebook profile in 2019 that showed a beaming young woman in Spain, she was certain she had found Tatyana. ""I just knew it was my sister."" Within weeks the two were chatting constantly online, pushing past language and cultural barriers. ""It was like a girlfriend that you're getting to know but really it's your sister and you want to share your life with her,"" said Tatyana. Excitedly they made plans to meet up in Spain, only to have the possibility derailed by the pandemic. In February, as Russian troops amassed on the border of Ukraine, Tatyana made a frantic call to Angelika. ""I told her that here they're saying that there's going to be a war,"" she said. Angelika sought to temper her sister's fears. ""I was hoping all of this would blow over and everything would be fine,"" she said. ""But it just got worse and worse."" She and her fiance left their home in Nova Odesa, heading to a nearby village where her cousin had converted his basement into a makeshift shelter. As the sound of bombings cracked in the distance, they would dart into the basement. ""Tatyana was texting me every day, saying pack up, we're all waiting for you, we're worried,"" she said. Angelika canvassed those around her, but her loved ones were determined to stay. ""It was a very difficult decision because I didn't want to leave my family,"" she said. ""I was also very worried about how I was going to get there on my own - it was a long way."" In the end it was a message from Tatyana's mother, reinforcing that she would be safe in Spain, that convinced Angelika. She set off for the Polish border in a vehicle with other Ukrainians looking to leave, steeling herself for the worst. ""I was terrified we would be detained or that there would be an air alert,"" said Angelika. Her anxiety was laced with nervousness for what lay ahead: ""The whole way I was thinking about what it would be like to see my sister and whether she would accept me,"" she said. From her home in Girona, Tatyana tracked Angelika's every step. She bought her a plane ticket from Warsaw, battling spotty mobile coverage and language barriers to make sure her sister made it on to the flight. ""I was going crazy,"" said Tatyana. ""She had never been on a plane, she didn't know how to check in or check her baggage."" The days of anxiety melted away as soon as she spotted her sister. ""I had always wondered what that moment would be like,"" said Tatyana. ""You think: 'Maybe I'll be in shock, maybe I won't know what to say, maybe I'll cry.' But in the end I just couldn't believe it was happening."" In the month since Angelika's arrival in Spain, the sisters have carved out a comfortable coexistence in Tatyana's apartment, using hand gestures, a handful of shared vocabulary and a lot of Google Translate to communicate. The ease of their interactions belies their decades apart; Angelika, who hates carrying a handbag, stuffs her phone and charger into her older sister's purse whenever they leave the house, while the two trade quiet nods of affirmation as they delve into the details of their past. ""There are days that go by and I'm looking at her and I still can't believe it,"" said Tatyana. ""I just think: 'You're here.'"" Echoing the uncertainty facing many of the 135,000 Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Spain in recent months, neither sister knows what comes next: whether Angelika will eventually return to her fiance, job and family in Ukraine, or seek to bring them to Spain and start over. ""Since we were little we've been dreaming of seeing each other again, but we would never have imagined that it would be because of a war,"" said Tatyana. For Angelika, being back with her sister was a ""wonderful, unbelievable feeling"". The joy, however, was rivalled by the angst of leaving her loved ones in a country at war.  ""I just can't stop thinking about it.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-05,1,Migration

But has the prime minister already lost faith in the home secretary? One cabinet source said Boris Johnson had been perturbed by the volume of negative headlines around the low number of refugees being granted visas, and speculated that Patel's future would again come under discussion at the summer reshuffle. They highlighted the cover of this week's Spectator magazine - formerly edited by Johnson - which featured a cartoon comparing the UK's bureaucratic response with that of other EU nations.  The scandal of the UK's inadequate offer to Ukrainian refugees makes the cover of the new Spectator, out tomorrow. Kate Andrews and Max Jeffrey report from Calais pic.twitter.com/lVseLPaHbZ - Fraser Nelson (@FraserNelson) March 9, 2022 Another MP said: ""Priti is fundamentally opposed to a more liberal system, yes, but the other issue is that she just cannot do effective, fast-paced delivery."" Allies of the home secretary say that criticism is deeply unfair; that officials are working 15-hour days to set up new systems from scratch and respond to changing humanitarian and security situations. They predict a significant rise in visa numbers by the end of the week, to about 5,000. The change Patel announced in response to an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday - to remove the need for Ukrainians with passports to make visa appointments - was hastily drafted in the previous 24 hours when officials realised the scale of the bottleneck in visa centres that are normally equipped to deal only with a handful of student or work permits. It has been a week of punishing criticism for the home secretary from her own MPs in parliament, including claims that had to be retracted about staffing in Calais and appointment wait times. Distraught families were banging on the windows of the Rzeszów visa centre when staff told them they were only able to see up to 100 applications in a day. The Tory MP Roger Gale said that Patel's behaviour this week would ""have been a resigning matter under any normal administration"". Another, Alec Shelbrooke, told the immigration minister Kevin Foster that the operation of the scheme was ""a disgrace"". On Tuesday, sources said Patel was given an uncomfortable grilling by cabinet ministers about the UK's response at their weekly meeting. One cabinet source said it was ""not a slanging match but more like an interrogation"". Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, cross-examined Patel repeatedly on the details of what was on offer and how support could be accessed. ""She floundered a bit,"" the source said. Others who have expressed frustration at the management of the scheme are the foreign secretary, Liz Truss; the defence secretary, Ben Wallace; and the health secretary, Sajid Javid. On Wednesday, Javid's department organised a separate plane to bring about 20 critically ill children to the UK for treatment. Several cabinet ministers have let their frustrations out during broadcast interviews when they have been repeatedly questioned about the failures. Shapps told broadcasters that ""lessons will be learned"" about how the response can be co-ordinated. A Patel ally did not deny there were tensions with the prime minister but said they did not think the home secretary had lost his confidence. ""The PM just wakes up and looks at the headlines and then moans about it,"" they said. ""Generally they have a pretty good relationship compared to almost anyone. ""She'll come speak to him, they see eye-to-eye on a lot. She likes him and she's taken a lot of blows for him. But of course it's difficult when there are just volumes of these tragic stories every single day in every paper."" Backbenchers describe feeling as if they have been slamming into a brick wall. Patel was urged internally to hold a video conference to explain the visa system to MPs but decided instead to send a ""dear colleague"" letter. There were also plans for her to make her own statement in the chamber, but events have forced announcements to be made at multiple urgent questions in the Commons. There is a broad view among MPs and officials that a wider Home Office culture - beyond Patel - is also at fault. One Whitehall source said Home Office officials genuinely believed its main problem was communication. ""If you've got people banging on the doors of the office in Poland, that's more than a comms problem."" Constant redrafting of the visa conditions has led to officials needing to hold thrice-daily briefings - more than any other situation has merited since Patel took over. One Whitehall source said there were genuine security concerns, citing the discovery of fake Ukrainian passports for sale. ""Over there are these Chechens groups, the Wagner Group mercenaries - her critics just aren't seeing the stuff she's seeing,"" the source said. Others named a combination of difficult delivery, inflexibility and ideology for the endless negative headlines. ""Fundamentally, cutting immigration dominates people's thinking,"" a former official said. ""They see their job, from when they wake up in the morning, as stopping people getting into this country. But actually, that's not their job.  ""Their job is to enforce our immigration policy - which does include letting some people in. Senior people are in that building now, reading these horrendous stories in the press and they are like: 'Argh, fuck, why is this happening again?' But if the general culture is to find ways of keeping people out, it's not a surprise really.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy
1203,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,16/6/2022,989 words,Emily Dugan,"Hundreds of Ukrainian refugees left homeless in England, data shows","Hundreds of Ukrainian families have been left homeless in England after arriving on visas designed to secure them a place to live, official figures reveal. Since the end of February, at least 480 Ukrainian families with children and 180 single adults have applied to councils for help with homelessness. Despite the government insisting that the Homes for Ukraine and family visa schemes would ensure that refugees had housing, both are leaving people struggling when arrangements break down. The data exposes the cracks already appearing in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, with 145 placements having ended in homelessness by 3 June. Of these, 90 ended because the arrangement broke down and a further 55 never got off the ground properly because the accommodation was unavailable or unsuitable on arrival. Lauren Scott, executive director of Refugees at Home, said: “We are frustrated and saddened but not surprised to see placements start to break down. Expecting vulnerable, traumatised refugees to rely on the goodwill of strangers they have met on Facebook was always a risk. “We urgently need a joined-up national fallback plan to help families whose placements go wrong. Across the country there is no consistent approach to rematching guests with new hosts, no standard way for Ukrainians to change their visa sponsors, and no single mechanism for moving funding from one host to another.” Many local authorities are treating Ukrainian families as homeless rather than attempting to rematch them with new hosts, leaving them in hostels and hotels, just as happened with Afghan refugees. Of the 145 failed Homes for Ukraine placements, only 20 were rematched with a new host. Scott said: “It is a nightmare situation – the very one that we had hoped to avoid.” Anna, 37, fled Kyiv with her husband and their three-year-old son when war broke out. They came to Britain at the end of March after matching with a family of four who lived in a large house in Northampton. After initially being welcoming, their hosts became less enthusiastic within a few weeks. “We didn’t understand what was happening because they changed their mood very quickly,” Anna said. Anna and her family were moved into an annexe. The host said he wanted a key to it and they agreed as long as he warned them before going in, but shortly afterwards he called the council to say he wanted to terminate his sponsorship. “They didn’t explain anything to us,” Anna said. “They were not ready to share their house. They tried to get rid of us as soon as possible.” Her family were put up in a Travelodge for several days by the council, sharing one room with no cooking facilities. They had no idea where to go. “We were desperate and felt we didn’t have any other options than to go back to Ukraine,” Anna said. Finally, after trawling the internet, they found Refugees at Home, who helped place them with another family. They are still scarred from the experience. “We lost our home in Ukraine, and when we came here we thought that we were safe, but actually we weren’t and we lost our home a second time.” The family visa scheme, which has been running the longest, accounted for 455 homeless applications. In many cases, families desperate to get their relatives out of Ukraine applied for visas but never had room for them to stay. The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said: “It is worrying to see that desperate Ukrainian families who have fled war, endured trauma and heartbreak, arriving here, entrusting their safety in our hands, to have been left to fall into homelessness. “Ukrainian families arriving here need a warm welcome, safe housing and benefits, emotional support, and connection. We’re concerned that Ukrainians arriving on family visas are running into problems as not all relatives will have the space or the resources to support their family members – which is why there needs to be the same level of funding available to them and local councils as is provided under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.” Lisa Nandy MP, shadow levelling up and housing secretary, said: “It is utterly shameful that families that have fled Putin’s brutal war have found themselves homeless here in the UK. “The British people showed amazing generosity in stepping up in their thousands to provide the care and sanctuary that these people – many of them families with young children – needed and deserved in such awful circumstances. “But the government has failed miserably to play its part. Ministers were warned about the risk of refugees becoming homeless on the day they launched the sponsorship scheme, but they were more interested in grandstanding in television studios than doing their jobs to protect vulnerable people. “The government must urgently set out a plan to support councils to find safe homes for these families.” Cllr David Renard, housing spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: “Currently, councils receive no data on, or funding for, people who are coming under the family visa scheme. Some of those families present as homeless once they have arrived, but we are asking that they should be able to be rematched with a sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. “Urgent work is needed on how councils can work with government and the community, faith and voluntary sector so those offering their homes can be quickly matched with a family in need.” A government spokesperson said: “More than 77,200 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK since Putin’s invasion and all arrivals have access to benefits and public services, as well as the right to work or study, from the day they arrive. “The overwhelming majority of people are settling in well, but in the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. Councils also have access to a rematching service to find a new sponsor in cases under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-06,0,Conditions

Applicants to host Ukrainian refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have expressed concern that some refugees are being forced to remain in the conflict zone while UK visas are processed. A Conservative councillor resigned from the party at the weekend after being shocked at the red tape surrounding the UK's Ukraine visa system, which she said reflected the government's ""hostile"" and ""xenophobic"" approach to refugees. Samantha Flower has applied to sponsor a 17-year-old Ukrainian boy to live with her family in Buxton, Derbyshire, but said she had been met by delays and bureaucracy. The child has been forced to remain in Ukraine while the paperwork is processed. ""If he doesn't make it out alive, it's because the red tape prevented it,"" she said. Her unease was reflected by the statement from the heads of the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam who warned that the visa system was ""causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians"". ""Those who want to come to the UK are having to navigate a complex web of bureaucratic paperwork to get visas, leaving them facing protracted delays without any information about the status of their application,"" the charity heads wrote in a letter published on Monday in the Times. ""The government must urgently review the use of visas and waive them as an immediate short-term measure, as has been done by the EU, and look to introduce a simplified emergency humanitarian visa process."" Flower, a councillor on High Peak borough council, has signed up to the UK's Home for Ukraine scheme , where strangers act as hosts, but has not yet been approved. Only 1,000 of the 25,000 completed applications have been approved so far. The boy and his stepmother and father, both lawyers, fled their home in Kyiv when Russia invaded. They arranged for the teenager to travel to the UK after contacting Flower online, where the councillor had offered her home. However, the boy has only a domestic Ukrainian passport and not the international passport required by the UK as part of its visa process. The boy's family have had to stay in Ukraine and wait for the correct paperwork - a process they have been told could take weeks. ""They're having to wait for the passport to be completed,"" said Flower. ""They had a shell land near their home five or six days ago. They don't know from one day to the other what's going to happen."" She said the government's complex visa system for Ukrainians reflected its ""hostile"" approach to all refugees, adding: ""We're tipping towards being quite far right and it's not the party that I joined."" More than 3.9 million refugees have left Ukraine in the past month, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, more than 2.2 million of whom have ended up in Poland. The Home Office has granted 21,600 visas to Ukrainians who are hoping to join relatives in Britain under the Ukraine Family scheme. The Department for Levelling Up, which is handling the parallel Homes for Ukraine scheme, for people who do not have family in the UK, has not yet released any figures about the number of visas granted. However, refugee hosting charities say the numbers of people coming through this scheme are so far ""tiny"". Lauren Scott, director of hosting charity Refugees at Home, said: ""We have been told anecdotally that the delay is largely down to the onerous visa application process, which is frustrating for our hosts and must be soul-destroying for guests. It is creating a huge bottleneck. So far we only know of three sponsorship visas granted to potential guests, and that's all to one family."" An opinion poll released on Sunday by Savanta ComRes indicated that 54% of people in the UK support a no-visa policy, and would like to allow an unlimited number of Ukrainians who are fleeing the Russian invasion to come to the UK. Despite concerns over the slowness of the process for granting visas to Ukrainian refugees, organisations working to resettle Afghan refugees who were airlifted from Kabul last August have asked the Homes for Ukraine scheme to be extended to allow households also to host Afghan families. In a letter to Michael Gove, secretary of state for levelling up, 50 signatories - including the head of the Refugee Council and former Conservative ministers Robert Buckland, Damian Green, Johnny Mercer and Caroline Nokes - called on the government to permit some of the 12,000 Afghans who are still being accommodated in hotels to be hosted in residential homes.",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy
1440,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,25/4/2022,642 words,Diane Taylor,Ukrainian refugee left homeless after UK host demanded bill money,"A Ukrainian refugee has been left homeless just days after moving in with a host in Brighton who demanded money from her to pay for utility bills. Olha, 36, who asked for her real name not to be used, moved in with her host who had registered with the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. But she was told to leave when she said she was unable to pay the money her host demanded. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities source said it was not acceptable for hosts to demand money from Ukrainian guests. Hosts can claim £350 a month from a government fund to cover the costs of hosting Ukrainian refugees. The deputy leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Hannah Clare, confirmed the council was aware of the case and condemned the government hosting scheme. ""The government's Homes for Ukraine scheme has been badly put together. Among its flaws is the fact that there is no mechanism for councils to transfer a Ukrainian guest to an alternative sponsor when something like this happens,"" she said. Olha, who was working in finance and economics before the war started, matched with a British woman in her 60s via a Facebook group and had registered with the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled her home in Dnipro on 28 March and began a dangerous and harrowing journey out of Ukraine by car. She arrived in Brighton about two weeks later. At first Olha thought things would go well with her host. She provided her with an evening meal when she arrived, but told her she would be expected to provide her own food after that.  But soon the host started demanding money and said Olha was costing her a lot in utility bills. ""She contacted the utility companies, asked them how much she had spent that week and told me that since I had arrived her energy bills had gone up a lot and that I needed to pay her £50 per week for energy bills. She said if I didn't want to pay her I had to leave,"" said Olha. ""I felt so upset I thought it would have been better for me to stay at home in Ukraine so that I wouldn't experience anything like this."" She left her host's home and has managed to find someone from a local church who offered to let her stay with her for a few days. ""I'm in a very difficult situation because my family are still in Ukraine. My brother is a soldier and my mother has refused to leave the country. I've received contradictory information about what I should do next. I don't want to scare other Ukrainians who are coming here but what happened to me is dreadful. It has caused me so much stress and made me feel totally unsafe. My host told me I needed to go. But where should I go? I have only just arrived in the UK."" According to the latest government data 6,600 people have arrived as part of the Ukraine sponsorship scheme with 39,300 visas for the initiative granted. Another 15,000 people have arrived under the Ukraine family scheme with 32,500 of these visas granted. Advice on the government website said sponsors should inform their local council if a hosting arrangement breaks down. Clare said: ""We are sadly aware of this really unfortunate situation. We understand that the woman in question is safe and has been helped by a local community group to find another place to live temporarily. We will do what we can to offer her support. ""Homes for Ukraine is a private matching scheme that is not mediated by councils. We have warned all along of the risk of some relationships breaking down and inappropriate hosts taking part due to a lack of proper oversight by the government. ""The scheme is at its heart deeply flawed. Councils have no control over when Ukrainian guests arrive in the city, nor do we get adequate notice. We rely on information from hosts about when refugees are arriving. With this in mind it isn't possible for councils to carry out property and welfare checks before guests arrive.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,0,Conditions

Even so, it was the male Russian officer ordering her to take off her blouse for an inspection that she found the worst indignity of the ordeal fleeing her home in Mariupol, Ukraine. “Bruises on the shoulders could mean you’re a sniper,” Olena explains from a cafe in Tbilisi, Georgia. She was horrified. “I told him, I’m turning 60 years old this August. How could I be a sniper?” The officer didn’t seem to care. “I’m not wearing my glasses anyway,” he told her. “Take your top off now.” Stories like Olena’s from a filtration camp in Nikolske, a town in the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic (DNR), are common among the growing number of Ukrainian refugees now in Georgia. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an estimated 20,000 Ukrainians have entered Georgia, many arriving from Russia through Georgia’s northern Kazbegi mountain border. Unable to flee Russian-occupied cities such as Mariupol and Kherson westward into Ukrainian-held territory, many Ukrainians are left with a terrible dilemma: stay in your besieged city, or flee to the country that has destroyed your home. To enter Russia, many Ukrainians are forced through so-called filtration, a process during which they are photographed, interrogated, their fingerprints taken, and the contents of their phones scrutinised. Men are ordered to strip to their underwear, their bodies searched for tattoos that could reveal a link to Ukrainian nationalist groups. Everyone is questioned on whether they or anyone they know has served in the Ukrainian army. During Olena’s interrogation, she recalled how a guard questioning a man at the next table found a keyring bearing the image of the Ukrainian coat of arms. Four guards then beat the man savagely with batons and kicks to the head before throwing him outside in sub-zero temperatures without a coat or hat. Filtration camps have been set up across towns and villages mostly concentrated in the DNR, including Novoazovsk, Mangush, Bezimenne and Nikolske. Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol by bus often arrive at the filtration camps unknowingly, having been told they would be taken to Ukrainian-held cities instead. After arrival, they are usually not allowed to leave the town. Filtration usually ends in one of two ways: either you “pass” the interrogation and are handed a small, stamped piece of paper with the date of your filtration and the signature of the supervising officer, or you will be detained for further questioning. The “camps” occupy schools, cultural centres, sports halls and other public buildings. Conditions are often abject and the camps are poorly organised. People like Olena, who was travelling with her 65-year-old sister Tamara and Tamara’s 70-year-old husband and like others interviewed would not give her full name, slept first on the floor, then on a cardboard box. For the first few days there was one meal a day offered by the canteen. Then the Russians closed the canteen altogether and told them to find their own food. For Maksym and Iulia, from Mariupol, filtration was also a lengthy ordeal, though they were lucky to have been offered a house to stay in nearby that belonged to one of Maksym’s classmates. They spent almost a month waiting to be filtered in Mangush. “Our number in the queue was 347,” Maksym says. “You go in and ask what the number is today, and you realise the number only went down by two or three. Why was it so slow? The process itself takes around 30 minutes.” It was only after Maksym told a military pharmacist that they were running low on insulin for Iulia’s diabetes that their wait was expedited and they were filtered that afternoon. Waiting in a corridor, they saw a man in Ukrainian army fatigues being questioned on his knees, his hands tied behind his back. Others report a shorter wait time, with some Ukrainians spending only a day or two at the camps before filtration and onward travel to Russia. One 29-year-old couple, Igor and Valentina from Mariupol, report being filtered within six hours of arriving in Nikolske. “The fact my wife was nine months pregnant at the time and we had to get to a hospital as soon as possible probably helped speed things along,” Igor says. You have to tell them you want to stay and make a life in Russia, then they’ll leave you alone  Maksym  Ukrainians who subsequently escaped to Georgia have avoided the reportedly widespread forced deportations to Russian cities. One woman, Zhanna, told of how her family slipped out of a back door of a filtration centre unnoticed after overhearing an officer say that she, her husband and their young son would be deported to a Russian island near Japan. With only migration cards, not filtration papers, Zhanna and her family travelled by bus from Novoazovsk to Russia’s Taganrog. From Taganrog, they travelled by train to Vladikavkaz, and crossed into Georgia in a minivan through the border at Kazbegi. Others say that informing officers of concrete plans to go to a specific Russian city was enough for them to be allowed to make their own way to Russia, and then onwards to Georgia. “You have to tell them you want to stay and make a life in Russia, then they’ll leave you alone,” Maksym says. Most of the buses taking filtered Ukrainians from the DNR to Russia terminate at Taganrog. There, most buy bus or train tickets to Rostov-on-Don, from where they can organise onward transport. Those who come to Georgia travel south to Vladikavkaz before crossing over into Georgia through the mountain border. Even once they reach the Russian border, their exit is not guaranteed. Men are routinely taken out of the queue and interrogated, their phones examined. One man, Petya, reported being forced to pay the Russian border guards a bribe in exchange for an exit stamp. Many of the Ukrainians now in Tbilisi are biding their time until they can return home to Ukraine. “My goddaughter is still in Mariupol and sent me photos with crosses stuck into the ground everywhere. The graves are even in our courtyards,” Olena says. “I want to go home, but that means somewhere in Ukraine not occupied by Russians.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-06,0,Conditions

Speaking at the end of an EU summit in Versailles, the French president was eviscerating about Johnson's approach towards those fleeing Russia's bombs. He said that by insisting that visa applications to the UK must be made in person in Brussels and Paris, the British government had imposed additional misery on desperate men, women and children. Macron accused the British government of failing to live up to its ""grand statements"". ""I would hope that the Ukrainian men and women who have lived through horror and crossed Europe to reach their families on UK territory will be better treated,"" he said. The searing criticism of the British prime minister came as Russian airstrikes hit three more cities in Ukraine on Friday and tanks and artillery moved to what appeared to be firing positions to the north-west of the capital, Kyiv. Across the country, Ukrainian civilians are being shelled as they seek to flee besieged cities, in what is now the fasting-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. In a Versailles declaration on Friday the EU said it would ""offer temporary protection to all war refugees from Ukraine"", with the UK almost alone in Europe in insisting that even those with relatives in Britain must apply for visas. The home secretary, Priti Patel, had claimed until Thursday that stringent in-person security checks at application centres were also needed to stop Russian agents or terrorists smuggling themselves into the UK. Under heavy pressure from MPs across the Commons, Patel reversed her policy on Thursday, announcing that online applications could be made from next Tuesday. But Macron said more had to be done by the British government, with already more than 2 million people having fled Ukraine and millions more expected. He said: ""I welcome the British shift, which shows there was a problem, despite what was being said at the time. I think nobody would have understood that despite all the grand statements we share that the British government continued to apply current rules that meant they did not welcome Ukrainian refugees who wanted to reach British soil saying they have to travel hundreds of kilometres in order to apply for a visa. ""It's a glimmer of pragmatism that they're starting to align themselves with their own statements, which is a step in the right direction, although much remains to be done. I think the French home affairs minister's letter was a helpful one [ Gérald Darmanin wrote to Patel at the weekend urging her to set up UK consular services in Calais]. ""Obviously we will do what we can and we are trying to cut back on the red tape so they can reach more dignified living conditions. I would like to thank the UK government for for this first step and we will over the coming day see whether it is enough or whether more effective measures are required."" The UK has so far only granted 957 visas out of at least 22,000 applications in progress. The policy of in-person applications caused chaos in Calais earlier this week as Patel had falsely claimed that a visa centre had been opened. Refugees who had travelled 1,400 miles (2,250km) to the Channel were welcomed by UK government posters informing them they needed to go to Paris or Brussels to make their applications. A minister later clarified that the application centre in Calais was in the process of being established, prompting calls for Patel's resignation by the Tory MP Roger Gale for misleading the House of Commons. The UK's Ukraine family scheme allows Ukrainian family members of British nationals and those settled in the UK to stay in Britain on successful completion of a visa application. Refugees who can find a private sponsor or local authority willing to provide housing and integration support can also come for an initial period of 12 months. In contrast, under the EU's policy all Ukrainian refugees have the right to live and work in the bloc for at least a year and potentially up to three years. Ukrainian citizens already have 90-day visa free access to the EU. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told reporters in Versailles: ""Indeed we welcome this improvement for the Ukrainian refugees, this is a good step in the absolute right direction. ""As you know we in the European Union already a week ago activated the temporary protection directive for the very first time in the history of the EU, which gives all Ukrainians immediate residency rights, access to the labour market, to schools, to medical care, to other support, so that these poor people can find a home and be accommodated in the European Union.""

Despite promises by the Association of British Insurers that people would not be penalised for taking in those fleeing the Ukrainian war, John Lewis demanded an extra £41.74 from Cath Bateman, on top of the £381 it recently charged to renew her home insurance. Bateman, who lives in a terrace house in Dartford, decided to offer the Ukrainian family somewhere to stay after learning that they were crammed into a small house. The family - a mother, her daughter aged 12 and four-year-old son - had been rescued from Poland by the mother's sister, who is originally from Ukraine but now lives in the UK. After the Guardian raised her case with the company, John Lewis said a mistake had been made, and that Bateman would be refunded. ""I don't have a big house but had two free rooms and offered to put them up when I learned that they were having to sleep on the floor,"" said the retired teacher. ""I thought I had better tell my insurer - more out of courtesy than anything - but couldn't believe it when they called me back to say that I would have to pay an extra £41. It feels completely wrong."" At the start of the conflict the Association of British Insurers said the industry stood ""united with the people of Ukraine in the face of the Russian invasion"" and that people housing refugees would not face financial penalty. ""If you are a homeowner in the UK and want to temporarily house refugees who have been displaced from the conflict in Ukraine as non-paying guests in your home, you do not need to inform your insurer and your cover will remain the same,"" it said. ""This applies for the first 12 months of any refugees living with you, including when your policy is due for renewal. After 12 months, if any refugees are still living with you, then you should tell your insurer when you next renew your policy."" A spokesperson for John Lewis said: ""We aren't charging any additional premiums for our customers who are welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their homes. We're very sorry a mistake was made in this case and the customer will receive a full refund."" This was just one issue faced by Bateman. She has been told that because the family were brought into the UK on a family visa by the sister, she will not be able to claim the £350 a month payments the government has offered. She has also been told that she has to get a £95 gas boiler safety certificate at her own expense. ""I'm still really pleased I have done it, and we are getting on well. However, the authorities could certainly do more to make it easier. Why those who help people who are brought in on family visas are not entitled to the £350 payments is beyond me. All our attempts to address this have so far failed.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,0,Aid

Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders. The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation was quickly deteriorating after Russia's invasion, estimating that several thousand had already fled with more expected to follow. It appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking a safe haven. ""We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety,"" said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. At the Luzhanka border crossing with Hungary in western Ukraine, hundreds of cars waited in a queue snaking more than 2 kilometres back from the border on Thursday afternoon. People said they had been waiting over six hours in line to cross. A steady stream of people crossed on foot, carrying suitcases and holdalls stuffed with belongings. Many were Ukrainians from the Hungarian minority that live in the west of the country, and said they were traveling to stay with relatives for a few days in the hope the danger would pass. Others had come from other parts of Ukraine and planned to drive on to Western Europe. ""The people who have money are leaving,"" said one of the customs officials at the post. He said over 1,500 people had left through the crossing by 4pm on Thursday, as opposed to just a few hundred on a normal day. One 19-year-old man from the town of Svyalava said he had left both because he was scared of Russian assault and of potentially being called up to the Ukrainian army. ""My brother lives in Hungary and I'll stay with him as long as it takes,"" he said, waiting at the border post. He asked not to use his name. Others also said they were fleeing before receiving army call-ups. People carrying luggage and accompanied by children crossed into the Polish city of Medyka, and lines of cars stretching for miles were reported on the approach to Ukraine's border with Moldova. For weeks, central European countries on Ukraine's western border have been making preparations for a potential influx of millions of refugees. Authorities in the countries next to Ukraine have already identified border crossings through which people can leave the country by land, such as Vyné Nemecké in Slovakia, Zhony in Hungary, Siret in Romania, and Palanca in Moldova. Maia Sandu, the president of Moldova, said on Thursday there was an increase in traffic flow on the border. Poland is preparing a train, with medical equipment, to transport wounded civilians from the Ukrainian border to Polish hospitals, said the country's health minister. ""We are preparing a sanitary train with full rescue service and medical equipment to transport the injured,"" said Adam Niedzielski. ""This solution was created completely from scratch and, so far, has not been used in Poland. At the same time, we already have a list of 120 hospitals throughout the country to which victims may go. In total, we estimate at the moment that it would be possible to admit several thousand patients."" Poland, in particular, has been preparing for various scenarios, including a wave of up to a million people fleeing Ukraine, said Maciej Wasik, the deputy interior minister. Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians , many of whom moved after the 2014 conflict, and they have taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. A few days ago, local authorities in the countries bordering Ukraine were asked to indicate the list of accommodation facilities for refugees, the number of people it would be possible to accommodate, the costs involved and the timeframe for the adaptation of buildings. The ground floor of the exhibition centre in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzeszów has been equipped to receive people who may flee Ukraine, about 30 miles to the east. Germany has said it will offer support to countries in eastern and central Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees. German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and a million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine in the event of a war. ""We will offer massive support to the affected states - especially our neighbour Poland - in the event of large refugee movements,"" the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said in a statement, adding she had been in touch with the Polish government and the European Commission. Franziska Giffey, the mayor of Berlin, told news outlet RBB 24 that the German capital was preparing for the arrival of refugees. ""For next week, we have set ourselves the goal of discussing concrete implications, what preparations we can make, especially in the event of people fleeing this situation,"" Giffey said. Other countries in Europe have offered support to countries in eastern Europe in case of a wave of refugees leaving Ukraine. António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, said potential refugees from Ukraine were welcome in the Iberian country, home to a large Ukrainian community. ""Ukrainian citizens who have family, friends and acquaintances here are welcome in Portugal,"" Costa said, promising to facilitate the issuance of entry visas.",Broadsheet,0,2022-02,0,Conditions
1220,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,3/8/2022,777 words,Tom Ambrose,"Ukrainians at risk from anti-refugee tensions in host countries, report warns","Ukrainian refugees are likely to become victims of rising tensions and disinformation campaigns in their host countries, a report has warned. False reports exaggerating how much aid refugees receive compared with local people, as well as linking refugees with violent crime and political extremism, could cause a breakdown in relations with local communities, the charity World Vision said. In its report, Warm Welcomes, Lurking Tensions , the humanitarian organisation said anti-refugee messaging was already spreading on social media and “niche media outlets” in neighbouring countries. About 8.8 million people, mainly women, children and elderly people, have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, with many making their way to border countries such as Romania, Moldova and Poland. “Messaging that could stoke anti-refugee tensions is already being spread in Romania, Moldova, Poland and across central and eastern Europe,” the report said. “Whilst not a major issue yet, tensions are beginning to develop in some host countries. “Children may face risks such as verbal and physical abuse between refugee and host communities, human trafficking and more as early as February 2023. “The international community needs to act now in order to prevent the situation deteriorating to dangerous levels like in Lebanon and Bangladesh.” The report’s lead author, Charles Lawley, an advocacy, policy and external engagement senior adviser at World Vision, said disinformation campaigns would change attitudes if misreporting was allowed to continue unchallenged. He said: “Whilst the disinformation campaigns have, thus far, been largely unsuccessful as solidarity with refugees from the host community remains strong, if it goes unchecked it will continue to worsen resentment towards refugees which we are seeing is starting to materialise. “In contexts like Lebanon, which has a considerable number of Syrian refugees , and Bangladesh, which has most of the world’s Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, disinformation went largely unchecked and became mainstream and has added to the extremely high tensions in those contexts.” The falsehoods being spread about Ukrainian refugees include exaggerating the financial support they are able to access, and incorrect claims of antisocial or illegal activity. There were also unfounded reports of local children being thrown out of hospitals and replaced by children from Ukraine, Lawley said. “Our case studies show a pattern which the Ukraine refugee influx is largely following,” he added, saying the initial response from the host community was “solidarity and hospitable”. But after a six- to 12-month period, the warm welcomes started to cool. “There are no obvious reasons why the contexts like Moldova and Romania, for example, would be exempt. When you consider how the global cost of living crisis is impacting everyone, we would argue that we expect tensions to develop soon if action is not taken.” Moldova in particular has felt the strain since the outbreak of war in neighbouring Ukraine. Europe’s poorest country has accommodated about 100,000 refugees, the most per capita in Europe. The numbers are equivalent to about 5% of the population, in a country where inflation is at 27% and the country’s almost total reliance on Russia and Belarus for gas has led to a fuel crisis. The report sets out a number of recommendations needed in order to ensure Ukrainian refugees do not suffer the same fate as others, such as Syrians who have been left displaced in Lebanon since civil war broke out in 2011. Local infrastructure should be improved for all communities, communication campaigns promoting coexistence and education about refugees, and opportunities for host communities and Ukrainian refugees, should be encouraged, the report said. “There are many valuable learnings governments and humanitarian responders alike in countries hosting large numbers of refugees from Ukraine can take from Lebanon, Chile, Bangladesh, Kenya and Uganda,” it said. “The distress of sudden displacement should not be compounded by facing negativity from the communities accommodating them. “If refugees in places like Poland, like refugees in Uganda, are immediately able to settle, take up employment, access public benefits such as healthcare and education, and can start their own businesses, then it has a significant impact on social cohesion.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks: ",Broadsheet,0,2022-08,0,Migration

After criticism of the government's strategy and the bureaucratic delays facing Ukrainians with family ties to the UK, the British public will be asked to house refugees who have no family ties who would be eligible to work, access state benefits and public services. Government sources confirmed to the Guardian a report in the Daily Telegraph that as part of the widening of the sponsorship scheme, individuals, charities, businesses and community groups will be able to register to offer accommodation and employment via a hotline and webpage. Those offering a place to stay will be vetted and have to agree to house a refugee for a minimum period. A senior source in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities told the Guardian it was still considering the length of time for which people from Ukraine will be able to reside in the UK under the scheme. Details of the new ""sponsored"" humanitarian refugee route are expected to be revealed on Sunday with a full announcement on Monday by Michael Gove, the communities secretary. The refugees are expected to be recruited by the Home Office and will require visas in addition to biometric and security checks. It comes after Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced that the UK is to ease its rigid entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees , enabling those with passports to apply for entry online and to have to give biometric details only after they arrive in the UK. Many have gone to Calais to discover that they could not apply for visas there and were sent to other cities, while a number of UK consular offices had limited numbers of appointments. On Thursday, Patel told the Commons that from Tuesday, such appointments would no longer be needed for Ukrainian nationals with passports. They could apply remotely and would be told when they could travel. The home secretary said: ""In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are, and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain. ""This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports."" The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, welcomed the change, but castigated Patel for the system thus far, calling the treatment ""a total, total disgrace, bringing shame on to our country"".

The family route... is the only route open right now for Ukrainians, [and] is proving horrendously bureaucratic. The other route they hope to open is the community sponsorship route. It cannot be allowed to be mired in that bureaucracy. But what we're saying to the UK government is make the requirements minimal, allow them to be done in this country, and allow the Scottish government working with agencies here to deliver that on the ground.  Sturgeon said the obstacles being put in the way for Ukrainain refugees using the family scheme (the only special visa scheme currently open to them) were ""unconscionable"". She cited one example: I have heard from one Ukrainian living here in Scotland right now about how a family member who has fled Ukraine, managed - after an arduous journey - to get to Poland and one of the things they have had to prove is that they were living in Ukraine before a certain date.

Onshore fracking is very different. Those calling for its return misunderstand the situation we find ourselves in. First, the UK has no gas supply issues. And even if we lifted the fracking moratorium tomorrow, it would take up to a decade to extract sufficient volumes - and it would come at a high cost for communities and our precious countryside. Second, no amount of shale gas from hundreds of wells dotted across rural England would be enough to lower the European price any time soon. And with the best will in the world, private companies are not going to sell the shale gas they produce to UK consumers below the market price. They are not charities, after all. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 2.41pm GMT block-time published-time 2.21pm GMT  This is from the FT's Jim Pickard, explaining why Kwasi Kwarteng has avoided answering questions about fracking in his statement to MPs.

In his response Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, confirmed that Labour backed the policy. But he asked Kwarteng to confirm that the moratorium on fracking would remain in place. He also asked if the government would abandon what he described as an effective moratorium on new onshore wind turbines in planning regulations, saying that since 2015 this had denied the UK the equivalent of the amount of power derived from Russia gas imports. Will he confirm that the moratorium that was put in place will remain in place, no ifs, no buts, as fracking would not make any difference to the prices consumers pay, is dangerous, and would take decades to come on stream?... Does he agree we should finally end the effective moratorium on on-shore wind in the planning regulations, which has denied us power each and every year since 2015 equivalent to our gas imports from Russia? In his reply Kwarteng did not address either of these points. He said he was glad Labour was committed to renewables, and he did not refer to fracking at all. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.54pm GMT block-time published-time 2.01pm GMT   No 10 refuses to rule out lifting moratorium on fracking, saying 'all options' being considered  Here are the main points from the post-PMQs Downing Street lobby briefing. No 10 would not rule out lifting the government's moratorium on fracking, saying ""all options"" would be considered as the government considered how to end the UK's reliance on Russian energy. The Telegraph reports today that Boris Johnson is considering reviving fracking. Asked about the story, the No 10 spokesperson said he would ""not get ahead of the energy supply strategy that we will set out in the coming days but, as you would expect, we will obviously consider all options"". Asked if that meant government policy was changing, he said: The moratorium on fracking remains in place. But as I say, you would expect the prime minister to look at all options given what has happened in Ukraine, given the rising cost in oil and gas, the wholesale prices and the effect that is having here in the UK. And he has been clear that he will set out an energy supply strategy. The spokesperson said the UK has now issued 957 Ukrainians visas to people fleeing Russian invasion.He said Johnson has ""full faith"" in Priti Patel, the home secretary, who is facing strong criticism from Tory colleagues for her handling of the refugee situation.The spokesperson said the new visa application centre at Lille is being set up today and will start accepting appointments from tomorrow morning.

The presence of coronavirus antibodies implies someone has had the infection in the past or has been vaccinated.

The Labour leader and I fly out tonight to Tallinn to reassure Estonia of the united UK determination to defend their security and to thank our British forces deployed there from the Royal Tank Regiment and the Royal Welsh Battlegroup. It was Labour's postwar foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, who was the principal architect of Nato, and in particular its article 5 commitment to collective defence. Today is the anniversary of Bevin's birth in 1881.

He explained: The government position is if you are a serving member of the armed forces you will be breaking the law [if you go to Ukraine to fight].  There were reports in a weekend newspaper about three members who had gone AWOL over the weekend. They will be breaking the law and they will be prosecuted when they return for going absent without leave or deserting. For others, as the government travel advice is don't go to Ukraine, we strongly discourage them from joining these forces. My experience from having been security minister is people who went off to join the YPG [the Kurdish militia fighting in Syria] and other organisations: it didn't end well. It is also the case that, as a number are now discovering, the Ukrainians are very clear: you turn up, you are in it for the whole game. You are not in it for a selfie and six weeks, you are in it for real.

Wallace said the UK would be sending more weapons to Ukraine. He said the government was sending a small consignment of Javelin anti-tank missiles and is looking at sending Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles. The UK has already sent 3,615 anti-tank weapons, he said.  On 17 January, I announced to the House the government's intention to supply military aid to the Ukrainian armed forces. The initial supply was to be 2,000 new light anti-tank weapons, smaller arms and ammunition. In response to further acts of aggression by Russia we have now increased that supply.  I can update the house as of today we will have delivered 3,615 NLAWs (anti-tank missiles) and will continue to deliver more. We will shortly be starting the delivery of small consignments of anti-tank Javelin missiles as well. Wallace said the government was ""bound by the decision to supply defensive systems"" and not escalate the war. He went on: In response to a Ukrainian request, the government has taken the decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity manned portable anti-air missiles. We believe that this system will remain within the definition of defensive weapons but will allow the Ukrainian force to better defend their skies. We shall also be increasing the supplies of rations, medical equipment and other non-lethal military aid.  He said the Ukrainians estimate the number of civilians killed or injured to be more than 1,000, but added: ""The true figure is expected to be much higher and I'm afraid worse is likely to come.He said he expected the Russian campaign to become 'more brutal and more indiscriminate'.He said 1,000 British troops were available in countries bordering Ukraine to support the humanitarian response. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.42pm GMT block-time published-time 12.50pm GMT   Wallace says the Ukrainians estimate that 211 schools have been damaged or destroyed. There has also been footage of kindergartens being hit. He says the president has talked about children dying of thirst. The Ukrainians estimate that 1,000 civilians have been killed or injured, but the true figure is likely to be higher, he says. block-time published-time 12.47pm GMT   UK considering supplying Ukraine with high-velocity anti-air missiles   Wallace says the UK is considering supplying Ukraine with Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles. He says the MoD thinks these would count as defensive weapons. Britain has now supplied 3,615 anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, Wallace says, and will also shortly be supplying a small consignment of Javelin anti-tank missiles.  block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.13pm GMT block-time published-time 12.45pm GMT   Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, is making a statement to MPs about the war. He says, according to the Ukrainian army, the Russians have lost 285 tanks, 985 armoured fighting vehicles, 109 artillery systems, 50 multiple launch rocket systems, 44 aircraft and 48 helicopters. He says the Ukrainians also think the Russians have lost 11,000 soldiers. But he stresses that these are Ukrainian figures; the UK has not been able to verify them. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.47pm GMT block-time published-time 12.40pm GMT   Johnson implies visa refugee waiver could heighten risk of UK facing attacks here from Russian agents   Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, recalls the UK's long history of taking in refugees. But this week Ukrainians were sent away because they did not have the right paperwork. He says the military should be dispatched to help.  Johnson says Davey is wrong in what he said. He says 1,000 people are already in under the existing system. (A few minutes ago he was saying nearly 1,000 visas had been issued.) But it is important to have checks, he says. Some people want to abandon them. He says that would be irresponsible. The Kremlin has singled out this country. We know how unscrupulous Vladimir Putin can be. He says it would not be right to expose the UK to greater risks. We've already got 1,000 people in under the existing scheme, that number will climb very sharply. No-one has been turned away... We know how unscrupulous Putin can be in his methods, it would not be right to expose this country to unnecessary security risk and we will not do it. We are going to be as generous as we can possibly be, but we must have checks. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.45pm GMT block-time published-time 12.35pm GMT   Paul Maynard (Con) asks if the PM will meet him to discuss how Blackpool can be a showcase for levelling up.

Has the PM ever overruled security advice when appointing peers? No, says Johnson.  He says the Kremlin has criticised the UK for taking the lead on global sanctions. (As my colleague Dan Sabbagh explains here , the allegation about Boris Johnson in relation to Evgeny Lebedev is not that he overruled the intelligence agencies, but that he leant on them to revise their assessment.) block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.38pm GMT block-time published-time 12.30pm GMT   Barbara Keeley (Lab) says people who have additional electricity costs for items like electric wheelchairs need extra help.

He says Poland has taken over 1.2 million refugees, Hungary more than 190,000, and Germany over 50,000. The Home Office's response has been one of the worst in Europe, he says.  Johnson says almost 1,000 people have now had visas. He expects those numbers to rise sharply, and he says he expects hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to come to the UK.  Blackford says Johnson does not understand the urgency. People are fleeing war crimes, and the home secretary is blocking them with bureaucracy. He says we have seen this many times in the past. The Home Office is offering bureaucracy, when it should be offering compassion. Will the government waive visa restrictions for Ukrainians?  Johnson claims the government has an unparalleled record. The PM, the deputy PM and the home secretary are all descended from refugees. The UK is the single biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Ukraine, he says. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.34pm GMT block-time published-time 12.16pm GMT   Johnson warns there are 'dark days ahead, and difficult times' as opposition to Putin continues   Starmer says opposing Putin will lead to extra costs. But people can manage those costs if there is a windfall tax on energy companies, he claims.  Jo hnson says he is junking ""failed energy policies"" that left the UK without enough nuclear power. He claims to be overjoyed that Labour favours nuclear too. They must work together to maintain their opposition to Putin, he says. He says there will be ""dark days ahead, and difficult times"", but the UK will come through this stronger, he says. block-time published-time 12.13pm GMT  ""Come off it,"" says S tarmer. He says Labour is in favour of nuclear power. But Johnson cannot get a single brick laid for a new nuclear plant.  Johnson says, under Labour, nuclear fell from producing about 25% of UK energy needs to about 10%. He says the government is supporting households with energy costs, and it can do this because it has the fastest growth in the G7. If we had listened to ""Captain Hindsight"", we would still be in lockdown, he claims. block-time published-time 12.11pm GMT   Starmer says the PM is ""protecting energy profits not working people"". More renewables are needed. But the Tories have effectively banned onshore wind. Will the PM relax planning laws and end this effective ban?  Johnson says, thanks to government policies, the government is only dependent on Russian gas for 3% of its supply. He says Starmer has also committed to backing more nuclear powers. He claims that is new, and says there is ""more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth"". Labour cancelled nuclear power, he says. block-time published-time 12.09pm GMT  ""We'll see how long that position lasts,"" Starmer says. He says energy companies are making huge profits, making more money than they know what to do with. When will the government put a windfall tax on those profits?  Johnson claims that would just lead to energy companies putting prices up even more. And it would discourage them from divesting in hydrocarbons. He repeats his claim to be rectifying mistakes made by Labour. block-time p",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,NA,NA

PA says: The Treasury committee were told that chancellor Rishi Sunak's measures will leave the poorest, out-of-work households the worst-off group from his support packages.  Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation (RF) think tank, said: ""I was very surprised that the chancellor had chosen the overall package he had when it came to what was on offer for lower-income households."" He pointed out that lower-income households will feel the pressure from rising energy bills - which is driving inflation. The economist added: ""It is an odd choice to have offered basically next to nothing to those households in this spring statement. I didn't think he would do that and I was wrong."" The RF has calculated that the cost of living crisis will push 1.3 million households into absolute poverty. Middle-income households can expect to see disposable income fall 4% next year after housing costs. For those in the poorest quarter, income falls 6%, and for out-of-work households it falls by 8%, the RF has said.  Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), agreed with an uprate in benefits and said there are mechanisms available to do it.

He says growing our own food is good, but he is not a believer in autarky. He wants to see an export drive. Many UK companies could sell more overseas than they do. Q: How long will it take for trade intensity to get back to pre-pandemic levels?  Johnson says there is no natural impediment to exports. It is just will and ambition, he claims.

Q: Can you level up the country without reducing the number of children living in poverty? No, says Johnson.  (If Johnson means this, it is a new commitment. The current levelling up targets do not cover poverty.) He says there is an issue the government must fix. He says there are 200,000 children in absolute poverty.  At the moment the cost of living is running too high. That is why the government must abate it, he says. He says the best way forward is to get more people into higher paid jobs.

British embassies now have officials helping to promote farming exports, he says. Q: Fertiliser costs four times what it did a year ago. That adds to the cost of food. We only produce 40% of the fertiliser we need. Can we reopen the fertiliser plant that has closed?  Johnson says hydrocarbons contribute to the costs for farmers.

He says there have been a few cases of this already. Q: We have promised Qataris visa-free access. But that is not happening. Why are we not getting the migrants we want, like Ukrainians and Qataris, but people on boats?  Johnson says he does want a ""much more fluid"" visa system for Qatar. Progress is likely soon, he says. Q: You said you wanted a light-touch system. What can you do to make sure you wish becomes your command?

Q: Shouldn't all our news media focus on getting the truth into Russia?  Johnson says the government is increasing funding for the BBC, and doing what it can to counter Russian disinformation. There are ""some signs it is getting through"", he claims. There is a ""growing awareness"" in Russia of what is happening. Q: There is nothing to stop Russia launching a new version of RT. Do we need a clearer definition of publisher in the online safety bill.  Johnson says he knows this is an issue Knight is following closely. The bill will define a publisher. Q: It is likely that Telegram will not be considered a high-risk publisher? Should it be included?  Johnson says his general feeling is that anyone putting stuff online in a systematic way should be defined as a news publisher, and subject to the controls in the bill.

Q: Do you agree with President Biden that Putin must go.  Johnson says he understands why Biden said that. And a desire for a change of government is not ignoble, he says.

The Met just said yesterday that the process of issuing those fines was under way - not that they had actually been sent out yet.)

There are nine measures, he says. First, HM Revenue and Customs will get new resources to check ferry operators are complying with minimum wage law, he says. HMRC will be dedicating significant resource to check that all UK ferry operators are compliant with the national minimum wage, no ifs, no buts. Second, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will review its enforcement policies, to ensure they are fit for purpose, he says.  Third, employers who have not made reasonable efforts to reach agreement about redundancies will not be allowed to use fire and rehire tactics, he says. A statutory code will allow employment tribunals to take this into account, he says. He says, if employers do not consult, under the code they will be liable to a 25% increase in compensation payments. We will take action to prevent employers who have not made reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation from using fire and rehire tactics. So new statutory code will allow a court or employment tribunal to take the manner of dismissal into account, and if an employer fails to comply with the code, impose a 25% uplift to a worker's compensation. Fourth, Shapps says he has written to the Insolvency Service saying that he thinks Peter Hebblethewaite, the P&O Ferries chief executive, is not fit to be a company director and asking that it consider disqualifying him. I have made no secret of my view that P&O Ferries' boss Peter Hebblethwaite should resign. He set out to break the law and boasted about it to this parliament. So I've written to the CEO of the Insolvency Service, conveying my firm belief that Peter Hebblethwaite is unfit to lead a British company. And I have asked them to consider his disqualification. The Insolvency Service has the legal powers to pursue complaints where a company has engaged in, and I quote, so-called sharp practice. Surely, the whole house agrees that nothing could be sharper than dismissing 800 staff and deliberately breaking the law whilst doing so. Fifth, there will be more focus on training and welfare in the maritime strategy, Shapps says.  It's a hard truth that those working at sea do not enjoy the same benefits of those working on land, which brings me to my fifth element of the package today: a renewed focus on the training and welfare elements of flagship maritime strategy. We are already investing £30m through the Maritime Training Fund to grow our seafarer population, but I will go further, pursuing worldwide agreements at the International Labour Organisation, where we will push for a common set of principles to support maritime workers, including an international minimum wage, a global framework for maritime training and skills. Sixth, from next week the government will create new incentives for maritime firms to operate from the UK and to have their vessels registered in this country.  Seventh, Shapps says he has opened talks with his counterparts in in France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany to discuss how maritime workers on direct routes between the UK and these countries should receive a minimum wage. He says the response has been positive, particularly from France. Much of maritime law is governed by international laws, obligations and treaties. And this means that we cannot hope to solve the problems alone. So the seventh plank our package today is to engage with international partners. Now, this week, I have already contacted my counterparts in France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany to discuss how maritime workers on direct routes between our countries should receive a minimum wage. I'm delighted to say the response has already been very, very positive, particularly with my French counterpart, the minister for transport. So, we will now work quickly with these counterparts to explore the creation of minimum wage corridors between our nations. But he says the UK cannot unilaterally change minimum wage rules for seafarers. That is because maritime law is governed by international conventions, he says. Eighth, Shapps says the government will legislate to allow ports to turn away vessels from ferry companies not paying the minimum wage.  enltrGrant Shapps tells the Commons: ""I can announce to the House our 8th measure, intention to give British ports new statutory powers to refuse access to regular ferry services which do not pay their crew a national minimum wage, we will achieve this through primary legislation..."" - Jim Pickard (@PickardJE) March 30, 2022 He goes on: We will achieve this through primary legislation to amend the Harbours Act 1964. And it means that if companies like P&O Ferries want to dock in ports, such as Dover and Hull and Liverpool, they will have no choice but to comply with this legislation. Crucially, it means that P&O Ferries can derive no benefit from the action that they have disgracefully taken.  So my message to P&O Ferries is this. The game is up, rehire those who want to return and pay your workers all of your workers a decent wage. And, ninth, Shapps says that, although it will take time to pass the legislation mentioned above (point 8), he says he will be writing to ports urging them to refuse access now to companies not paying the minimum wage. He will tell them they will have the full backing of the government in doing this, he says. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 3.49pm BST block-time published-time 2.10pm BST   No 10 refuses to admit law broken at Downing Street during Partygate  At the post-PMQs lobby briefing, the PM's spokesperson repeatedly declined to agree with Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, who said this morning the Met's decision to issue 20 fixed penalty notice means there were ""clearly breaches of the regulations"".

Boris Johnson was heckled by opposition MPs after claiming he wants to cut taxes - just days before they are hiked by the government. The opposition benches erupted in fury after the prime minister made the remark as he tried to counter criticism from Keir Starmer about the government's response to the cost-of-living crisis. Starmer accused the prime minister of putting the Tory re-election campaign ""over and above"" helping people pay their bills. Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week announced measures to help households, including raising the national insurance threshold to help offset the impact of April's tax hike. It was previously announced that a UK-wide 1.25 percentage point increase in NI contributions will be introduced from April 6, with funds raised ring-fenced for health and social care. Sunak also reconfirmed that households will receive a rebate on their energy bills which will need to be repaid at a later date, and announced a desire for a 1p cut to the basic rate of income tax by 2024. Starmer said: ""Does the prime minister still think that he and the chancellor are tax-cutting Conservatives?""  Johnson replied: ""Yes, Mr Speaker, I certainly do, because this is the government that has just introduced not only the biggest cut in ",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,NA,NA
1361,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,9/3/2022,538 words,Editorial,The Guardian view on the UK's shameful treatment of Ukrainians: not an accident,"At the start of the week, the Home Office boasted of unprecedented action, declaring breathlessly: ""The UK government's Ukraine family scheme is the first visa scheme in the world to launch since President Putin's invasion of Ukraine."" It was a telling assertion, not only because it is the sort of casually misleading claim we have grown used to from the home secretary, Priti Patel, and Boris Johnson, but also because it expresses a broader truth about the UK's treatment of refugees.  The statement was factually true - but only because Ukrainians do not need visas to enter the European Union, and the UK had to be strong-armed into broadening its restrictive definition of ""close relatives"". More than 2 million people have escaped the war, but the UK has accepted only 760 of 22,000 applications so far. A second scheme, yet to begin, will allow individuals and organisations to sponsor Ukrainians - again, cherrypicking victims of war rather than respecting the international convention setting out their rights. Ms Patel spoke of a new humanitarian route, only for Downing Street to swiftly rule that out. As with the asylum system overall, the approach is grudging, inefficient and overly bureaucratic, in large part because it is designed to keep people out. What meagre help is being offered has been dogged by confusion and contradiction. The home secretary promised she had ""surged a Home Office team"" to help at Calais, but families who had travelled over a thousand miles found a few officials giving out packets of crisps , and were told to go to Paris or Brussels to apply. Then a new ""pop-up"" centre in Lille, still 70 miles from Calais, was announced ; it now appears that it will neither take walk-in applications nor offer appointments but deal with biometrics for the ""most vulnerable"" of these traumatised people. One Ukrainian mother and daughter made eight trips to the UK visa processing centre in Paris , two trips to the British consulate there and one trip to the British embassy. Even after obtaining the correct visas, they were detained for a second time by UK Border Force officials in Calais. Plenty of refugees could testify to the incompetence and inhumanity of the UK's asylum system. The difference this time is that across Europe, including in places previously extremely hostile to migrants and refugees, there is greater public sympathy for white Europeans fleeing their homes. The meanness of the UK government's approach is not new; it is more visible this time, however, because it is not only out of step with domestic public opinion but strikingly at odds with the welcome now offered by other nations. Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a population of just 4 million, has taken more than 80,000 Ukrainians. The UK's failure to help Ukrainian refugees is not an accident, though its ineptitude has worsened the plight of many. It is possible to have a humane and efficient asylum system, but not when you promote stereotypes of refugees as a threat and a burden. The government has closed off safe routes - while its nationality and borders bill seeks to criminalise those who arrive here by irregular means. Ukrainians are the latest victims of its cruelty.",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy

A month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine 10 million people are believed to have left their homes, of whom 3.6 million are thought to have left for neighbouring countries, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The Home Office has granted 18,600 visas to Ukrainian relatives of UK citizens, but there is rising frustration among those who have applied for visas under the government's two schemes - a family process and sponsorship programme - many of whom describe long delays without any way of knowing the status of their applications. Some refugees are stuck because their passports are believed to be locked up in a UK visa processing centre in Kyiv, which has now been closed due to the fighting. Others are worried because they are running out of money to pay hotel bills while they wait. Some families have been split because visas have been granted at different times. British national Nadiia Mackowiak, a London-based interpreter, is puzzled that visas have been granted to her father, sister and five-year-old niece, while her mother, Nadiia Pavlenko, is still waiting, 18 days after applying. ""My parents had to leave Kyiv after a missile hit their home; they saw their block burning and falling down. My mother is in very bad way, and is desperate to be with us here,"" she said. Her sister and niece have traveled to the UK, but her father and her mother, who ran a nursery in Kyiv until earlier this year, are still in Poland, staying with strangers who have given them a room. Her mother has twice been issued with UK visas previously. ""It's hard to understand what the problem is; it's too much bureaucracy. These people have fled a war."" Sandip Basu, a volunteer legal adviser with the Ukraine Advice Project, said he had advised one family of refugees who fled Ukraine in late February and applied for UK visas Budapest, but were forced to return to Ukraine while they waited two weeks for the visas to be processed ""It was clearly a dangerous measure but they could not afford to remain in Budapest,"" he said. Since 6 March, Michelle Potts has been in a rented one-bedroom flat in Bucharest with her 72-year-old mother-in-law Olga Selivanova, who uses a wheelchair, and her 12-year-old twin godchildren, who have left their village on the outskirts of Kyiv. ""We were told it would take five days to process their applications on 9 March, but we're still waiting. The children don't understand why it's taking so long. The UK visa system isn't fit for purpose at the best of times; it's certainly not fit for emergencies."" Tatiana Dembicka, 73, a retired university administrator from Kyiv, has been waiting since 4 March for her application to join her son, Eugene, a British citizen in the UK. Her case was raised with the home secretary and with the minister for refugees Lord Harrington by her son's MP Lucy Frazer, and she was told that a decision had been made on Tuesday, however her family was still waiting on Thursday for an emailing explaining what the decision was. ""I can't see why there is such a delay between a decision and notification,"" her son-in-law Karl Dembicki said. ""We feel embarrassed by the government's lack of empathy."" Several people described technical and practical difficulties with the Homes for Ukraine application form. One man said the woman he was hoping to sponsor was living in an underground shelter in Kyiv, and unable to return to her flat to collect documents required for the form. ""It is nerve-racking. The situation in Kyiv is not great. Due to the lack of the required document, we're not sure what the outcome of the visa application will be, but we're hoping for the best,"" he said. Clare Birkbeck, who is studying for a masters, said she was one of a group of about 10 families in Saffron Walden, Suffolk, trying to host refugees; she hopes to host Katryn Zakharchuk 35 and her son Alexander Zakharchuk 15. ""It's a black hole of stress. Katryn and her son are sleeping on the floor of a room in Krakow, belonging to a very kind Polish man, with six people, unable to access funds from their Ukrainian bank. We've had no further communication since submitting the form; you just have to wait. They are desperate and I'm unable to help because of the shambolic system."" Lucy Ward, a writer, said she had spent over seven hours grappling with forms to sponsor two mothers and two children over the weekend. ""There are a lot of baffled people; I speak Russian and I'm used to filling in visa forms, but I still found it confusing,"" she said, adding that there was a lot of pressure on hosts to make it work. ""It's so devolved. It's like a Victorian charity or a knit-your-own refugee scheme. I know it's been done quickly, but there has to be a better way."" The refugees are currently staying in a school sports hall in Poland. ""We've been told nothing about how long it might take,"" she said. Robina Qureshi, director of the refugee homelessness charity Positive Action in Housing, said her charity was assisting 415 who were trying to be matched with UK sponsors. ""No one is getting visas from the families we are helping. Many families are living in war zones in Ukraine and won't leave until they know they can travel to the UK. The UK's visa approach to refugees is putting them at additional risk; under the refugee convention they don't need a visa,"" she said. The local government associations said it was still waiting to be given guidance on exactly how and when safety checks on sponsors' homes should be done. A government spokesperson said changes had been made to simplify the visa application forms, adding: ""We are very aware that many people fleeing Putin's invasion will not have certain documents with them.

1157,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,17/3/2023,762 words,Amelia Gentleman,Ukrainian refugees struggling to find accommodation after leaving UK sponsors,"More than half of Ukrainian refugees struggle to find affordable rental accommodation after moving on from living with their host families, according to research published a year on from the launch of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. In the past year more than 117,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under the hosting scheme. Another 49,000 have arrived to join relatives who were already living here. But practical problems face those who need to move on from the accommodation offered by UK sponsors and find themselves unable to rent or secure social housing. A survey of 325 Ukrainian refugees carried out by Generation Rent and the charity Opora, which supports Ukrainians in the UK, found that 49% had been unable to provide a guarantor when looking for somewhere to rent and 43% had been unable to find money for a tenancy deposit. British host families were asked to make an initial six-month commitment to accommodate refugees from Ukraine, and many have been unable to extend that invitation into a more permanent arrangement as the conflict has continued. A total of 4,630 Ukrainian refugee households have been classified as homeless after a relationship with their host family came to an end. The latest data shows a 44% increase in the number of Ukrainians presenting as homeless in the last month, according to the Local Government Association. A number of anniversary events this week have celebrated the achievements of the scheme, which was rolled out just 18 days after the start of the war and under which 71% of Ukrainian refugees in the UK are being hosted by people who were strangers beforehand, according to the Sanctuary Foundation, one of the main matching organisations helping hosts to find refugees. Krish Kandiah, the Sanctuary Foundation’s founder, describes the scheme as an overwhelming success, adding that it is “the largest UK response to a refugee crisis since the historic Kindertransport of 1939 ”. He hopes the programme will become a template for wider refugee sponsorship programmes, arguing that it has saved £4.4bn of taxpayers’ money because the government has not had to pay for hotel accommodation (unlike the Afghan resettlement programme, which saw those rescued from Kabul placed in hotels). But other organisations have called on the government to focus on the practical difficulties facing those who need to find independent housing. Stan Beneš, managing director of Opora, said: “This research makes it clear that Ukrainian refugees are currently facing a disproportionately high level of structural barriers in accessing the private rented sector. People are having to settle for properties that are clearly not suitable for sustainable rebuilding of lives, as reflected in the percentage reporting damp and mould, and unaddressed disrepair.” Anastasia Salnikova, who runs the J&C Soul group for Ukrainian refugees which supports families living in unsuitable temporary accommodation, said: “Often the council tells them they need to find and rent their own flats, knowing that they can’t do it. They feel abandoned.” She is supporting Anna Didenko, her husband, Dmytro, and their two children, Yaroslav, 10 and Bohdan, one, who have been sleeping on bunkbeds in a small room in a shared house shared in Hounslow since last July, when their original sponsor found himself unable to continue hosting them. They were told by the council the placement would just be for two or three weeks, but they have been there for almost eight months, sharing a kitchen with seven other households. “We’re happy to be here, away from the danger, but we feel neglected and ignored,” said Didenko, an accountant from Kyiv. Despite numerous visits to estate agents, their attempts to rent privately have been unsuccessful because they do not have the income or deposit required. There is no room for a table in the room, and their older son is struggling to do his homework on the top bunk. “It’s impossible to make any plans. Our situation feels humiliating and demoralising.” A government spokesperson said: “In the year since we launched Homes for Ukraine we have welcomed 117,100 people to safety thanks to the generosity of British families across the country. All guests can work and access benefits and local authorities have a legal duty to ensure no families are left without housing. “We are giving councils funding for each Homes for Ukraine guest and have recently also extended and increased ‘thank you’ payments for sponsors. Just yesterday we announced £1m to help Ukrainians improve their English and unlock employment opportunities.”",Broadsheet,0,2023-03,0,Migration

Among those hit with sanctions by the EU in recent days over Russia's invasion of Ukraine are Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, who separately own mansions in London and Surrey. Both men stepped down from the board of their private investment group, LetterOne, on Tuesday. Aven attended a business meeting with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week, which his spokesperson said he was required to do. He bought the plot of Ingliston House in Virginia Water in the 2000s for an estimated £8m, and he has spoken of housing a vast art collection there. The property is owned through a company. Fridman bought and still owns Athlone House in north London, paying £65m for the property in 2016, according to the Land Registry. A spokesperson for both men said the justifications for EU sanctions were ""simply and demonstrably false"" and stressed that the pair were in no way involved in politics, had condemned the war and would contest the allegations. Fridman has previously said he did not know whether he would face sanctions in the UK and hoped it would not happen. Igor Shuvalov, a former Russian deputy prime minister who chairs Russia's state development bank, is also said to be a London property owner under EU sanctions. He was named in the House of Commons by Labour as owning two flats in Westminster, bought for an estimated £11m. On Wednesday Keir Starmer said the only reason Shuvalov was known to be the real owner of the flats was because it had been revealed by the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. ""Transparency is essential to rooting out corruption,"" the Labour leader said. ""It should be built into our law, but it's not. And I'm ashamed that we only know about Shuvalov's Westminster flats because a dissident risked his life. Is the prime minister?"" Another billionaire oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, is under sanctions in the US and has previously challenged the restrictions in the courts. He is listed by the US Department of the Treasury as residing at Belgrave Square in London. The property was bought in 2005 for an estimated £25m through Ravellot Ltd, a company based in the British Virgin Islands. A spokesperson for the businessman said the property was ""owned by members of Mr Deripaska's family"". The spokesperson added: ""As regards the US sanctions against Mr Deripaska, the grounds on which they were imposed are entirely baseless. No evidence has ever been produced to substantiate allegations of wrongdoing against him. I trust that Mr Deripaska's position on the importance of peace speaks for itself."" There is more of a mystery surrounding London property previously linked to Alisher Usmanov, who was put under EU sanctions this week and whose sponsorship links to Everton football club were recently frozen. He has for many years been reported as having owned two mansions - one on the same Hampstead road in north London as Fridman and another in Surrey. Usmanov bought the Grade-II listed Beechwood, which is set in 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of ground, for £48m in 2008 through Hanley Ltd, a company based in the Isle of Man. He has also been reported to be the owner of Sutton Place, a 72-room Tudor mansion near Guildford in Surrey that was once frequented by Henry VIII, and was bought for an unknown amount in the mid-2000s. It was marketed for £25m but is thought to have sold for less. However, Usmanov's spokesperson on Wednesday disputed the information about his property ownership, without being specific about whether he was no longer the beneficial owner of one or both of the properties. Usmanov previously said in response to the EU's move: ""I believe such a decision is unfair and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honour, dignity and business reputation. I will use all legal means to protect my honour and reputation."" Questions have been mounting from British MPs in recent days over why the UK has not matched the US and EU in some of its sanctions. So far, fewer than 10 oligarchs have been sanctioned by the UK in relation to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions have also been brought against Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. A British official rebuffed suggestions that the UK was moving too slowly on imposing further sanctions against individuals close to the Russian president and their business interests. The official pointed to measures such as a ban on all Russian-flagged ships docking in UK ports as an example of how the government was ahead of the EU, US and other G7 nations, but admitted there were ""quite significant risks of asset flights"" from those fearing they could have their finances frozen. Analysis by the NGO Transparency UK has previously estimated that since 2016 £1.5bn's worth of UK property has been bought by Russians with alleged links to the Kremlin. Amid a lack of transparency over the beneficial owners of London property, Labour wrote to the government on Wednesday urging it to change proposed legislation to give foreign property owners 28 days rather than 18 months to reveal their identity. The Liberal Democrats called for the government to seize empty property in London owned by oligarchs with links to the Kremlin in order to house Ukrainian refugees. Alistair Carmichael, the party's home affairs spokesperson, said: ""It's time to freeze these assets and put them to good use, by temporarily housing Ukrainian refugees escaping this terrible war.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,NA,NA

Tymofiy Seidov, eight, did not want to come out of his underground home in Kutuzivka, east of Kharkiv, due to Russian fire, but he was gently persuaded to leave on Sunday by his mother, Rita Sotnikova, and a second woman in the basement, Alla Lisnenko, 59. ""When we took Tymofiy out of the bomb shelter, he kept holding my hand,"" Rita said. ""He kept telling me, 'Mum, let's go back inside, Mum, let's hide, Mum, let's not be out in the open.'"" Kutuzivka, 12 miles east of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, has been on the frontline of the war in Ukraine since 24 February and it was retaken from Russian forces three weeks ago at a heavy price for those living among its ruins. The village was bombed throughout and of the 1,500 people who had lived there only about 50 remain - most of whom had been living alongside Tymofiy in the dark dusty cellar where the young boy had spent much of his time drawing pictures of monsters, tanks and remembered beaches and happier days under the sun. Along with Rita, his aunt Yana, 33, grandmother Lyudmyla, 57 and grandfather Mykola, 62, Tymofiy is now heading to the relative safety of western Ukraine but the family's final destination is Zurich in Switzerland where more than 40,000 Ukrainian refugees have made a home since the war began. Their future remains full of uncertainty as they look to resettle in a strange country without money or the ability to speak the local languages yet Rita said the family had no choice but to flee the fighting. ""At first, Tymofiy did not want to leave Kutuzivka,"" she said. ""He was very upset when we told him we were leaving. I think he is now afraid of travelling. He cried. He was afraid of artillery shelling when we were taken from Kutuzivka to Kharkiv. ""He is afraid of shelling throughout Ukraine. Alla, as a mother, and we all talked to him and convinced him that we are going to a place where nothing will shoot and where everything will be quiet."" Rita said her son's health had begun to wane after living for 87 days with 23 others in the almost pitch black 40-by-five-metre basement below the ruins of two-storey kindergarten and medical centre. ""Tymofiy was examined by a doctor and diagnosed with an allergy to dust from the basement,"" Rita said. ""This dust from the basement walls, which Tymofiy was breathing all the time, had begun to cause an allergic reaction."" The family's evacuation was made possible after a Guardian reader with connections to Ukraine Now, a not-for-profit organisation, made contact to offer logistical help while the Ukrainian military agreed to provide safe passage. The reader did not want to be identified but said he hoped others would donate funds to help Tymofiy and his family and called for a greater political effort in the west to ""prevent the suffering of millions caused by the insanity of the few"". Rita said making the decision to leave Kutuzivka had been difficult although it was confirmed as the right move as they emerged from the basement to see the full scale of the damage wreaked on her village. She said: ""My mother cried all the time, all these days when we were packing she cried. She cried all the way from Kutuzivka to Kharkiv railway station. When we started to leave Kutuzivka we saw how our village was destroyed. We saw that Kutuzivka was in ruins. ""This was the first time we saw our village because all these days we were constantly in the basement. And when we went out and saw the scale of the destruction, I had a lump in my throat from pain and sadness. We had lived in our peaceful village for a long time and in one moment it has been destroyed. It was very painful for us to look at it."" She went on: ""My parents really didn't want to go. They did not want to leave their home. But I convinced them. Because we don't know what will happen tomorrow. We are afraid that tomorrow the war may return to our village. I told my parents it was safe. We will not be constantly under fire and we needed to go."" Rita added that she hopes in the future to help others to escape and that she would never forget the aid given to her by the readers of the Guardian. ""If I could, I would also help people - take them to safe places, would help them settle,"" she said. ""After we experienced all this horror in Kutuzivka, I realised how important evacuation is for people from dangerous places.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-05,NA,NA
1224,urc_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,4/6/2022,1345 words,Natasha May,'We can make it work': the NSW region opening doors and hearts to Ukrainians,"Jenni Chapple has five new sets of girls' size-4 clothing, a child's dressing gown and puffer jacket hanging in her closet. These are not for her own granddaughter, but a three-year-old girl she has never met, who is arriving from Kharkiv in Ukraine. Three-year-old Daneliia, along with her parents Vlodymyr and Julia, is the second Ukrainian refugee family Jenni and her husband, Mark Chapple, are helping settle in Quirindi on the north-west slopes of New South Wales. They initially meet new arrivals online before they arrive in the country, ascertaining their needs - from what size clothing each person wears, to whether they take any medication. But the Chapples are thinking about the big picture too. They want to help Ukrainian refugees get work and make a life for themselves in northwestern NSW, where the cost of living is cheaper and workers are desperately needed across all industries. Their aim is to see 40 to 60 Ukrainian refugees living independently around Quirindi, the Liverpool Plains, Tamworth and Gunnedah by the year's end, arriving via Newcastle and the Hunter regions. The Chapples' proposal for a pathway to assist Ukrainians settle in regional NSW - the Chl project - is named after the first couple the Chapples sponsored, who are working with them on the initiative. Yuri and Inna Chuchenko say Mark and Jenni have done more than help them. ""They save us. They now like our mother and father,"" Yuri Chuchenko says. The couple were working in Thailand and expecting their first baby when Russia invaded Ukraine. Mark, who had worked in Ukraine in agricultural insurance, was sending offers of help to all his Ukrainian contacts, including friends of friends, like the Chuchenkos. While former prime minister Scott Morrison said it would be wrong to assume Ukrainians would not want to return home after the war , Yuri Chuchenko says ""in Ukraine, there is no way back."" Yuri, from the Donbas region occupied eight years ago, says, ""I can say that I lost everything twice. The first time I lost my home town in 2014. And now [my country] in 2022."" Inna, whose family is from Nikolaev in the country's south, says her grandmother had to shelter for three weeks in her apartment's bathroom without water or electricity. Yuri says, ""we want to stay in this country. We want to become citizens of this country, because unfortunately we don't have a home any more.""  'Crying out for workers'  The Australian government's temporary humanitarian visa is granted for a three-year period, during which the holder can work, study and access Medicare, and potentially participate in free English language tuition. Since 23 February, the Department of Home Affairs has granted more than 7,800 - mostly temporary - visas to Ukrainians in Ukraine and hundreds more to Ukrainians elsewhere. More than 3,000 have since arrived in Australia. About 40% have entered NSW, with just under 30% arriving in Victoria and 15% in Queensland. A spokesperson for the department said it is, ""progressing visa applications from Ukrainian nationals as a priority, particularly for those with a connection to Australia."" Mark says that while the majority of refugees are coming to the cities, the high cost of living in Sydney and Melbourne could make the experience stressful rather than successful, especially when government support ends. ""We know that the regional centres are crying out for workers. I've had three offers today,"" he says, referring to requests for Ukrainian workers. According to Jenni, the inability to get the labour needed in regional areas means employers are happy to support the Ukrainian refugees with a job and accommodation. A central part of the transition will be to connect refugees with host families until permanent accommodation is found. Jenni says five families have already volunteered, with offers to support refugees with temporary accommodation for a couple of weeks as well as more long-term arrangements.  Building communities  The interest from Ukrainian refugees has been strong. Since Mark posted about the project online at the beginning of May, the Chapples are receiving 12 inquiries a day. Jenni says the Ukrainians who have contacted them offer a wide range of skills, including those areas where professionals are most desperately needed.  ""We've got pharmacists that are looking for work. We've got doctors looking for work. Now how often do we hear of regional areas saying we need more doctors out here ? So there's there's been some promising conversations around those specialty jobs as well,"" she says. The project would also provide immediate support, including assistance with visa applications, clothing and health. However, Mark says, ""our basis for wanting to make this work is longevity."" In addition to helping the refugees find well-paid jobs that will allow them to become independent, the project aims to help them become part of regional communities and facilitate cultural exchange. According to Mark, one of the reasons refugees have gathered in cities is because that is where they can keep in touch with fellow Ukrainian expatriates. ""We don't want to send two families to Gunnedah, for example, we want to send 20 families so that they can also have their own culture ... so that they feel that they've got another family of Ukrainians two streets away,"" he says. The Chapples want Ukrainians to be able to teach regional communities about their culture at the same time as the project helps Ukrainians understand Australian - especially Indigenous - culture. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia's fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The project aims to provide community hubs for training and immediate support services, as well as working closely with local education facilities, and community groups to integrate Ukrainian refugees. Jenni says the Ukrainian people bring an incredible community-mindedness, strong work ethic as well as amazing food. Yuri, a past contestant on Ukrainian MasterChef, has not only been cooking delicious meals for the Chapples but will also participate in a cultural cooking festival, the Newcastle Unity in Diversity festival, held at the end of June.  'This is a paradise'  The Chapples have already contacted local governments for support and want to work with the state and federal governments. They have held meetings with the Liverpool Plains and Gunnedah shire councils to gain support for the project and discuss the opportunities for Ukrainian refugees in the regions that may be of mutual benefit. Councillor Donna Lawson at the Liverpool Plains Shire Council says, ""for the Liverpool Plains, we can benefit from a population injection of people who offer a wide variety of skills, many of whom have run successful companies before the war"". ""We offer a safe and friendly community that may also provide an easier and more relaxed transition to living in Australia than the city,"" she says. Jenni says the ups and downs of families adjusting to their new life are evident. ""They're hearing the news daily. When Kharkiv and Kyiv were being hard hit, you could see their faces, from about lunchtime onwards, their moods would change, they would be getting information through from home, families having to relocate to a safe space, all of those things,"" she says. Jenni stresses the project will support the mental health of refugees, to address any trauma arising from the war. Having communication lines for all medical support, but especially mental health support, is a crucial part of the Chapples' project. According to Mark, ""regional towns are very well renowned for helping others. There's no doubt in my mind, we can make it work."" ""It was said to Yurii on his first trip to Quirindi, 'why would you want to come and live in a town of 3,000 people?'."" ""And he said, 'well, why wouldn't I want to come? This is a paradise'.""

3195,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,16/12/2022,1050 words,Elliot Spagat,"Russians find asylum lifeline to US, but at a high price"," Phil Metzger promises to arrange entry to the United States for Russian-speaking asylum-seekers through unmatched connections with U.S. border officials and people in Mexico who can guarantee safety while traveling. Though seeking asylum is free, the pastor of Calvary San Diego said his services are “not cheap.” In an interview with a Russian-language YouTube channel, he touted director computer access to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to enroll migrants and was vague about “opportunists” in Mexico who ensure customers’ safety after they fly there on tourist visas and while they wait in Tijuana to cross. “I just know there’s a lot of power on that side that I just don’t control,” the evangelical Christian pastor said. “But I do have one control. I control who goes across. So I have to negotiate. To keep those people safe, I have to negotiate with those in power (in Mexico).” Asylum is supposed to be free and for those most in need; many have been unable to even ask for protection under COVID-19 restrictions that are set to expire Wednesday.  Yet Metzger’s service, as described in the 25-minute interview last month at his church in the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista, is a private money-generating enterprise that uses its government connections to bypass those restrictions. It’s part of an opaque, bewildering patchwork of exemptions CBP has developed. Immigration advocates select who gets in, though CBP has final say. Asked about an outside group charging money, the Department of Homeland Security said there is no fee related to exemptions from asylum restrictions and that it will “look into any allegation of abuse.” “DHS takes any allegations of fraud or abuse of our immigration systems very seriously,” it said in a written response to questions about the service. The pastor did not respond to text, email and phone messages left over a week and his office was closed when a reporter went there on a recent weekday afternoon. ___ This story is part of an ongoing Associated Press series, “Migration Inc,” which investigates individuals and companies that profit from the movement of people who flee violence and civil strife in their homelands. ___ Migrants have been denied rights to seek asylum more than 2.5 million times since March 2020 on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19 under Trump-era restrictions known as Title 42. Exemptions are supposed to be for migrants deemed most vulnerable in Mexico — perhaps for gender identity or sexual orientation, or for being specifically threatened with violence — but some partners say CBP doesn't question choices and that migrants selected often face no unusual danger. The agency doesn’t publicly identify its partners or how many slots are made available to each, leaving migrants guessing who they are and which ones are best connected to U.S. authorities. In El Paso, Texas, CBP gives out 70 slots daily, half for the government of Mexico's Chihuahua state and the rest for attorneys and advocacy groups, said Nicolas Palazzo, an attorney for Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, which participates in the arrangement. He said some attorneys unaffiliated with his organization charge migrants for the service. In Piedras Negras, Mexico, across from Eagle Pass, Texas, the city government chooses who escapes the reach of Title 42, according to a report last month from the University of Texas at Austin Strauss Center for International Security and Law. In Reynosa, across from McAllen, Texas, a migrant shelter picks who crosses, while in Laredo, Texas, there are no exemptions, the report says. In San Diego, CBP exempts about 200 people daily, including 40 slots that are set aside for Russian speakers working through Calvary San Diego, said Enrique Lucero, the city of Tijuana's director of migrant affairs, who regularly communicates with U.S. officials.  Other slots in San Diego are for advocacy groups Al Otro Lado, which operates an online registration list, and Border Angels, which leans on migrant shelter directors to select who gets to cross, and the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a refugee resettlement organization. CBP is allowing more Russians to enter the United States with Title 42 exemptions, with about 3 in 4 coming through California border crossings with Mexico. In October, it exempted 3,879 Russians, more than triple the same period a year earlier. It exempted 21,626 Russians in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, more than five times the previous year. In the YouTube interview last month with Alex Moore, Metzger said his call center fields more than 1,000 inquiries a day. CBP tells him how many people can cross and “I control who crosses.” “Honestly, we think it was God opening a door for us,” said Metzger, who grew up in Southern California but spent much of his adult life in Eastern Europe. Metzger is unclear on who he pays to greet customers in Mexico and bring them to the border, saying he doesn’t know them. Through a Telegram account called Most V USA, the cost for single adults paying cash was 1,800 (presumably U.S. dollars) Monday — a “price reduction.” For married couples paying cash, the cost was $3,500. Online payments were $300 less for individuals and $500 less for couples. Children were free. “You pay not for the crossing, but for the consultation on the crossing,” Most V USA says on its website. “We use the only legal way available to our organization — making an appointment with a CBP officer at the border.”  The price includes crossing to the United States safely in groups from Tijuana to San Diego, with a bag containing water and protein bars. Metzger opened his large church to Ukrainian refugees after Russia's invasion this year, working with volunteers on a smooth-running operation that deployed a mobile app used to track church attendance. Ukrainians who flew to Tijuana were told to report to a San Diego border crossing as their numbers approached, a system organizers likened to waiting for a restaurant table.  Metzger touts connections with CBP developed during that time and warns about falling for scammers who use his Most V USA brand.  “No, it’s not cheap. No, it’s not easy but we will make sure that it is safe and that you will get into the States,” he said.  ___ Associated Press writer Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed.",Broadsheet,0,2022-12,1,Migration

Baker Matteo Cunsolo is making and selling ""peace bread"" in the blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag, with proceeds going to a charitable fund helping refugees who cross into Italy or who are remaining in Ukraine.  In addition, Cunsolo and area bakers have made 600 kilograms (1,325 pounds) of cookies to give out to young refugees. He plans to bring the sweets, along with a truck full of locally donated diapers, food, medicine and clothes, to the Ukrainian-Polish border next week.

""When I heard the word bread I thought - 'OK I am a baker, what can I do to help?'"" He uses natural food coloring to make the bread: saffron to color the dough yellow, and an infusion made from the leaves of the blue butterfly pea flower, or clitoria ternatea, to get the blue. Once baked, he uses a butter-based spray and a ""PEACE"" stencil to decorate each loaf. ""It's a really important initiative,"" said customer Maria Pascolin as she shopped at the bakery. ""It's a drop in the ocean, but if we all gave a contribution, it would help.""

As you said, first of all the pandemic. “You have steered very skilfully Ireland through the pandemic and out of the pandemic, and I highly appreciate how you’ve always been a strong supporter of our vaccine strategy. “You have presented an excellent national recovery resilience plan and the next generation EU where I had the honour and pleasure to be here to present it together with you. “Now, indeed, we are in difficult times because Russia unleashed an atrocious war against Ukraine.

3048,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,27/3/2022,792 words,ALICE MURPHY,Ireland's warm welcome to Ukrainians hides a dark truth about its asylum policy,"Ireland, the Land of a Hundred Thousand Welcomes, has been lauded the world over for opening its arms to desperate Ukrainians fleeing the murderous mania of Vladimir Putin. Famed for their friendliness and natural inclination for craic, the Irish trade on a reputation for being one of the most hospitable countries on Earth, greeting strangers with smiles and a willingness to help however, whenever we can. The beaming faces of thousands of Ukrainians safe and well in scenic spots across the Republic strengthen this stereotype in the purest way possible. But a peek under the rug of the state's ignoble asylum seeker policy suggests such warm céad míle fáiltes are exclusively reserved for a certain kind of people. Widely considered as modern Ireland's greatest shame, Direct Provision was established in 1999 as a short-term solution to a sharp uptick in the influx of people seeking asylum in the country. In most European countries, people in need of international protection receive financial assistance which enables them to live in that country while their application is pending. Under Direct Provision, however, this is not the case. Ireland's accommodation system shunts vulnerable arrivals into Soviet-esque centres in remote areas, where they are served set meals in a canteen at fixed times and handed the princely sum of Euro 38.80 (£29) per adult and Euro 29.80 (£22) per child each week. That's a maximum ""allowance"" of just Euro 5.50 (£4) a day. The bulk of these glorified prisons were built in rural backwaters, with limited transport links and little to no support services. Each one has a chequered past; a convent in Waterford, a Midlands trailer park, abandoned Celtic-Tiger-era hotels. Residents who come from far-flung lands - from North Africa and the Middle East, to southeast Asia and the Balkans - live in communal settings, with single adults sharing rooms with up to eight others of different backgrounds and nationalities. Some centres house only men, some only women. Many have no shared language and many have lived through extreme trauma, having fled torture, trafficking, and tragic conflict. Before being granted such luxuries, those unlucky enough to find themselves at the mercy of this framework can spend up to six months in cramped city hotel rooms, where they must wait to receive a coveted temporary residence certificate, a lifeline without which asylum seekers cannot claim expenses or obtain a social security number. All they are left with is time. Arguably unique in its psychological cruelty, Direct Provision prevents people from living in the community, thereby stripping them of their independence and any ability to integrate into Irish society. Until 2018, Direct Provision residents had no right to work. Even now, they must wait six months and that right remains limited. There are currently 8,205 people - 2,658 of them children - in DP and emergency accommodation facilities across Ireland, according to the latest data. The average length of stay is 24 months, but some languish in the system for as long as 12 years. The malevolent undertones of Direct Provision are more pronounced by the fact that big business is making bank on the existence of such a system. The majority of centres are managed by private, for-profit contractors on behalf of the State. Aramark, a US catering conglomerate that runs some of Ireland's most iconic cafes and turned over a cool $14.6bn in 2017, is one of them. Years of criticism from international organisations and tireless activism from human rights groups including the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland has led to small-scale improvements, with asylum seekers now entitled to a driving licence, broader access to education, and a bank account in their own name. The Irish government last year caved to pressure and pledged to end Direct Provision by 2024, but fears are now mounting that myopia regarding the plight of Ukrainians could scupper that goal. Just as the Dail granted Ukrainians the right to live and work as EU citizens in Ireland, the body of an elderly woman, believed to be from Zimbabwe, was found in a Cork Direct Provision centre. She had been dead for several days before anyone noticed. Ireland expects to have welcomed 20,000 Ukrainian refugees into the state by the end of this month, which will be five weeks since Russia's invasion began. There they can work, study, and live just as any citizen of the Republic is entitled to live. While there is no question that my homeland is doing right by the people of Ukraine, such support should be extended to every man, woman and child fleeing war and persecution from every corner of the world. It should not be conditional on geography, geopolitics or how ""European"" they may appear to be.",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Aid
2862,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,4/3/2022,584 words,Andrew Woodcock,Boris Johnson U-turn to speed up sanctions on Russian elite,"Boris Johnson has backed down on plans to allow Russian oligarchs 18 months to register ownership of luxury properties in the UK, slashing the proposed ""grace period"" to six months. And he announced plans to streamline the process of sanctioning individuals with links to Vladimir Putin , by removing the legal requirement for government lawyers to show that measures are ""appropriate"" before implementing them. But the changes fall well short of demands from Labour, who had called for a maximum 28-day delay before registers must be updated to identify the true owner of a property rather than a shell company. Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said the government's tardiness in dealing with Russian ""dirty money"" in London has left the UK trailing behind the US and EU in imposing sanctions on Putin's cronies in response to the invasion of Ukraine.  Mr Johnson's decision to amend the Economic Crimes Bill before it comes before the Commons on Monday amounts to an admission that Britain's sanctions regime has been less able to respond swiftly than its American and European allies, who have already sanctioned hundreds of individuals. Legislation passed in the wake of Brexit to allow the UK to operate its own regime independent from the EU included measures requiring a watertight legal case to be established for each individual targeted - something which officials admit could take months. Removing the ""appropriateness"" test will allow the designation of groups, permitting the UK to align its sanctions lists with those imposed by Washington and Brussels. Those named could have travel bans imposed as well as asset freezes which prevent them from selling, renting, visiting or even repairing UK properties with a total estimated value of well over £1bn. Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab has even suggested the homes could be seized to house Ukrainian refugees. London has so far sanctioned only 15 oligarchs, including Alisher Usmanov, who has had financial links with Arsenal and Everton football clubs. Critics have warned that delays will allow billionaires who fear being put on the UK blacklist time to sell off assets and move their money abroad. Putin associate Roman Abramovich has announced plans to sell Chelsea FC, though there has been no official indication that he is being considered for sanctions. Meanwhile, ministers said that keeping a six-month grace period for property registration would help crack down on money while giving people with legitimate reasons to hold property in overseas entities time to comply. Mr Johnson said: ""The UK has led the way with the toughest package of sanctions against Putin's regime and we're bolstering this with new powers in our arsenal to go further and faster. ""We will ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil and close the net on corruption. They will have nowhere to hide."" But Mr Lammy responded: ""It is totally unacceptable that Putin-linked oligarchs who should have already faced sanctions are being allowed to move their money around because of government incompetence.   ""Ministers should have introduced the laws needed to work in lock-step with our allies and partners months ago, not be left sanctioning hundreds fewer individuals and entities than the EU and the US. ""We welcome the government's U-turn under pressure from Labour to tighten the law so we can move on more oligarchs tied to Putin's regime, but we must also move faster, acting against these individuals in âdays not months.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,0,Policy

Using a pseudonym, Milena Ivakova, 61, said she fled her home in Odesa, a port city in southern Ukraine, while recovering from hip replacement surgery with her 40-year-old daughter and her three granddaughters aged 10, 17, 20 and 22. She is now working at the same refuge centre as a translator and language tutor, helping her fellow Ukrainian refugees learn Romanian so they can settle into their new home and find work. The centre, which is run by four Romanian non-governmental organisations, has received support and donations from humanitarian aid charity World Vision. World Vision is one of the Disasters Emergency Committee's (DEC) member charities working directly or through local partners in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries to help the humanitarian crisis. Ms Ivakova and her family arrived in Iasi, a city in north eastern Romania and 200 miles north of the capital Bucharest , on March 9, having fled their native country the day before. They travelled by bus, car and walking before reaching their new home. The family left behind Ms Ivakova's son-in-law, who is a priest, and her two cats who he is looking after. Emotionally, I am so grateful to Romanians as they've helped us so much and still are helping all our people. They gave us food, they gave us clothes, they gave us everything Milena Ivakova After arriving at a friend's flat in the city, Ms Ivakova went to the refuge centre to seek supplies, including hygiene products and food, also have a doctor check her hip following the surgery. Speaking through a translator, Ms Ivakova told the PA news agency: ""(Fleeing Ukraine) was stressful. ""It was just after my surgery. ""I really needed to have doctor's assistance to check my wound and to have special medication. ""I had no choice (but to flee after the surgery). ""I walked three kilometres with crutches (nearly two miles) and then flagged down a car which drove me to the border while the rest of my family walked 10 kilometres (six miles). ""I couldn't walk any longer than that."" Ms Ivakova said while the family is grateful to the help and support they have received from Romanians, their ""hearts and souls"" remain in Ukraine. ""We talk with my son-in-law every day,"" she said. ""It's still very dangerous and unsafe where he is now. ""Physically, I feel a lot better since my surgery as time is passing and my wound has closed, and now I can walk with just one crutch. ""Emotionally, I am so grateful to Romanians as they've helped us so much and still are helping all our people. ""They gave us food, they gave us clothes, they gave us everything. ""We care very much about everything which is happening back at home. ""We think about it daily, we check the news, we're here but our souls and hearts are still in Ukraine. ""Not just my son in law but my friends, my colleagues, my whole life is back there. ""I had a conversation with one of my friends the other day while she was standing on a balcony at her home and I was talking to her, I saw the airport runway (in Odesa) being demolished from the bombing. ""She stopped the conversation and hid in a shelter."" She said she and her family will remain in Romania for the time being but want to return to Odesa when it is safe to do so. Since the end of March, Ms Ivakova, who is normally a language teacher in Ukraine, has been giving Romanian language lessons to her fellow refugees in the centre. Explaining why she decided to do so, she said: ""I believe that we do have to help each other. ""I still need help, I still receive help. ""We feel safe, we feel comfortable and I feel like we're cared for and protected in Romania. ""We feel like this place is our family.

3294,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,26/3/2022,1148 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,'Stranded in purgatory',"The UK government has been accused of leaving Ukrainian refugees ""stranded in purgatory"" as large numbers are still waiting for the Home Office's permission to join their loved ones in Britain weeks after applying. The family visa scheme set up in response to the Ukraine war has been described as a shambles, as lawyers warn that refugees who have relatives ready to support them in the UK are being given inaccurate information, asked for unnecessary documents and told to send their passports across the continent. Nearly half of the 35,500 Ukrainians who have applied to the scheme, which was launched on 4 March, are still waiting for a decision - amounting to more than 15,400 individuals. The Independent has spoken to refugees who have been forced to pay for accommodation for weeks as they wait for their visas to be processed. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper the situation was appalling and called on the Home Office to simplify the process, adding: ""The government has had months to prepare for this, and yet delays across the system are still causing chaos and confusion. ""They should also set up emergency centres along the main travel routes to provide assistance for Ukrainians wanting to reach the UK. The Home Office's response has completely failed to meet the scale and urgency of this crisis, and it is Ukrainian families who are paying the price."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: ""As if the anxiety and uncertainty of fleeing their homes isn't awful enough, Ukrainians are being left stranded in purgatory by a visa scheme in shambles. It is simply unforgivable. ""Ministers need to drop the red tape and let refugees fleeing Putin's bombs come here without having to apply for a visa - some compassion would not go amiss, either."" Nataliia Tsvyakh, who fled from Ukraine on 24 February with her two sons, Mark, three and Denys, five - leaving her husband and parents, who did not want to leave, behind - said she was struggling to keep her children calm after waiting for weeks to join her uncle and his family in the UK. Ms Tsyakh had to wait until 17 March to attend a visa appointment to submit photographs and fingerprints. Her eldest son's passport is expired, but she was told she could attach his application with her passport, and that she would receive a decision within two days. But Ms Tsyakh has since been informed by the Home Office that she needs to submit a separate application for her son, which is delaying the case further. Her uncle, Oleksandr Khanyhin, travelled to Romania on 5 March to help her to make the application. They had been staying in a hotel in Bucharest for about Euro 70 (£58) a night, and have now moved to a cheaper hostel - the four of them staying in one room - which costs them Euro 30 per night. ""It's hard, it's like a constant pressure. Are they going to give you the visas, are they not, what are we going to do if they don't? That's at the back of our minds every day,"" Ms Tsyakh told The Independent. ""When we first left I told the kids I was taking them on an adventure. But they've seen planes flying and people crying. They're asking me why is this happening. The eldest is asking me why we're still in this hostel. I'm just trying to keep them calm and not frustrated."" In another case, Roxy Savchenko, left her home in Cardiff on 2 March to meet her sister Daryna Savchenko and her 10-month-old baby Vladyslav in Warsaw after they fled from Ukraine. She had expected to be able to return with them to the UK within a couple of days, but more than a fortnight later they remain on the continent, in Paris, dealing with a ""ridiculous"" visa process. Despite initially being told that the baby could be included on Daryna's application, on Wednesday they received an email from the Home Office stating that Vladyslav needed a separate application. They have now submitted an application for him and are still awaiting a decision. Ms Savchenko said: ""We have had enough. It's all very very difficult. None of us have to be in this situation. We could have been back in the UK three weeks ago. This is ridiculous."" Jennifer Blair, an immigration lawyer who is voluntarily advising Ukrainians trying to reach the UK via the Ukraine Advice Project, said the application process was ""chaotic"" and ""unsatisfactory"". She pointed out that a ""good chunk"" of those applying were still in Ukraine because they do not want to leave until they have somewhere safe to live, adding: ""People are at risk of death as they wait. ""This week a lot of the enquiries are about delays and there's not much we can say to people. From the beginning we have said the government should find a way to let people in and decide on their applications in-country, but there's been no sense of a crisis response."" Ms Blair described ""really horrible"" situations where some members of a family had been granted their visas and others had not. ""This is causing a lot of confusion, and there's no way to really sort it out. What happens if they leave and then their mother is killed?"" she said. The advice project had also come across a number of cases where applicants have been told they must send their passports to another country to have their visas processed, Ms Blair said, citing two cases where people applying in Poland were asked to post their passports to Germany. Kerry Garcia, another immigration lawyer supporting Ukrainians on a pro bono basis, said: ""The system is still a mess, which is making it very hard to help people. ""The emails the Home Office send out make little sense. It's impossible to contact anyone, document lists are generated asking for unnecessary documents, the online system was reset on Tuesday last week so documents we had uploaded disappeared. ""There is no clarity on the process and ultimately it is incredibly frustrating for everyone concerned. I have been practising immigration for nearly 20 years and while the system is not perfect I have never known anything as bad as this."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are moving as quickly as possible to ensure that those fleeing horrific persecution in Ukraine can find safety in the UK. ""We have streamlined the visa application process so valid passport holders no longer have to attend in-person appointments before arriving and made changes to our forms to help people through the process as quickly as possible.""

The monks living at the remote 15th-century Romanian Orthodox monastery, a pilgrimage site that sits in a valley covered in dense forest, have opened its doors to people like Svetlana who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries in their millions since Russia began its invasion on 24 February. Svetlana left her home city with her daughter Anna, six-year-old grandson Maksim and two other female relatives. Anna's husband and her two siblings stayed behind, helping with humanitarian aid. ""We would go home in a second, our souls are so heavy,"" Svetlana says. ""We are sorry we had to separate from our family. Right now we feel fear and confusion, we don't know what to do next."" As she weeps, Father Gherasim Soca quietly embraces and comforts her. Later that day, villagers brave a snow storm to attend a service at which monks pray for the people of Ukraine, inside the large stone church with shimmering icons. ""The majority of people want to reach their final destination, usually somewhere in the west, as soon as possible, and if they can, they choose to spend the night near the border towns,"" says Father Gherasim. ""Putna is a little more remote, but for those who are not in a rush, they are not crowded here, each family have their own room. I see them go to church and praying, getting comfort. It helps a lot."" More than 412,000 Ukrainians have fled to Romania, where thousands of volunteers, churches, non-governmental organisations and government agencies are providing food, shelter, clothes and transportation. In northeast Romania, the Suceava and Radauti Orthodox archdiocese has offered hundreds of beds in monasteries as well as parish houses. They also have a permanent presence at the Siret border and adjacent train station including priests and monks who speak Ukrainian or Russian, offering food and help. ""A large part of Ukrainians are going to relatives who work abroad,"" says Father Alexandru Flavian Sava, the archdiocese's spokesperson. ""To them, it is more comforting to move on than stop so close to the border and the violence beyond."" Father Gherasim says roughly 100 people, mostly women and children, have so far taken shelter at Putna. Among them is a couple who come with their baby from Ivano-Frankivsk. The father used his dual Romanian passport to leave, as Ukrainian men of conscription age are not allowed to. ""We have a little girl. We left because we are afraid for us and her,"" says the father, who wishes to remain anonymous.

2937,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,4/3/2022,678 words,Andrew Woodcock,Russian energy sector next in line for UK sanctions over Ukraine,"Britain is to step up action against Russia 's oil and gas industries as part of its efforts to isolate Vladimir Putin 's regime globally. Sanctions imposed by London in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine have so far focused largely on the banking and defence sectors, along with a handful of oligarchs close to the Russian president. But The Independent understands that the focus will move next week to measures directed at the energy industries which earn Russia much of its international revenues. It is hoped that these steps will have a quicker impact than the faltering campaign to freeze the UK assets of wealthy Russians, which has been slowed by legal requirements to establish a watertight case for each individual before acting. Putin cronies such as Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov are now unable to sell, rent, visit or even repair their mansions worth millions in the UK. And ministers are even talking of seizing them to use as housing for Ukrainian refugees. But with dozens of oligarchs being considered for sanction along with 350 members of the Moscow parliament, officials admit it could take months for blacklists to take effect. On Friday the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, used meetings with allied counterparts in Brussels to urge the west to wean itself off Russian energy supplies as a key means ofimposing a price on Putin for his aggression. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, did not rule out the suspension of EU gas imports, telling reporters who asked if that was an option: ""We will consider everything. Everything remains on the table."" While sanctions have disrupted much of Russia's trade with the outside world, gas and oil supplies have kept flowing, and the spike in global prices has done much to offset the impact on Moscow of losses elsewhere. The UK imports only about 3 per cent of its gas from Russia, compared to about 40 per cent for the EU, which also gets 25 per cent of its oil from its eastern neighbour. Boris Johnson has said that Europe needs to ""work together to wean ourselves off - to end the dependency on - Russian gas"", and has suggested that the UK could assist allies with renewable technologies to help make the switch from fossil fuels. And ministers have told officials working on the UK sanctions package in Whitehall that energy is an area where they want tougher action. Measures already announced in the financial sector are believed to have had a knock-on impact on Russian energy firms, for instance by stopping Gazprom from continuing to raise billions for investment from the London markets, as it has in recent years. Any direct sanctions on energy firms are likely to be taken in coordination with US and EU allies, as unilateral action might have the impact only of raising prices on the global market. Practical measures to wean the EU off its reliance on Russian energy could include a significant increase in deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from sources such as Qatar at ports across the continent, with the aim of meeting demand next winter if supplies from Russia are cut off. It is thought that EU states like Germany and Italy, which are heavily reliant on Russian gas, have enough stocks to see them through the remainder of the colder months, and there are hopes that new distribution networks could help ensure supplies of LNG are available to them by the autumn. A partial ban on Russia's use of the Swift financial transaction system has permitted continued payments for fuel. And while Russian ships are banned from docking at British ports, vessels from other countries carrying Russian gas are still allowed to unload. Dockers at the LNG terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent refused to unload tankers carrying Russian gas. Also likely to be next in line for UK measures is the services sector, with the Treasury already taking action in the insurance market and similar steps likely to follow. And legislation is expected to give longer-term effect to the exclusion of Russian aviation from UK airports, after it was initially introduced last week through temporary orders.",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy

The issues have been reported with the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows Britons to sponsor and host those fleeing the warzone in eastern Europe.  Disagreements between refugees and host families -including over costs and different lifestyles -have resulted in Ukrainians being turfed out, according toThe Guardian.  Others reportedly include conflicts caused by communication problems, a lack of proper house rules and personality clashes.  ""Our community is seeing these cases frequently and our perception is that they're increasing,"" Iryna Terlecky from the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain told The Guardian.  One case reported by the newspaper included a host that was strictly vegetarian and did not want meat in the house, which caused tension resulting in the host wanting the refugee family to leave as soon as possible. Councils have previously warned relationship breakdowns with hosts were leaving Ukrainians in the UK without a place to stay.  The Local Government Association found at least three dozen Ukrainian households had registered as homeless in the UK within the first two weeks of the Homes for Ukraine scheme opening. Reports of Ukrainians being kicked out of homes have sparked calls for a rematching system for those who have arrived on the Homes for Ukraine scheme but need to find a new host family.  A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: ""We do not recognise these claims -more than 46,100 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well.""

In government since March, Lord Harrington stressed his resignation is no reflection on either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak and he instead feels it is the right time to leave a “temporary” position. Boris Johnson was among those to pay tribute to his efforts, with the outgoing prime minister saying that the government would miss his “wealth of experience”. Lord Harrington, who thanked Mr Johnson for appointing him, said his decision means the next prime minister can “save” on a ministerial position.  Thank you, Richard, for your work on welcoming 120,000 Ukrainian refugees to the UK, following Putin's war in Ukraine. Your wealth of experience in government will be sorely missed. https://t.co/UZ3ECzvCMs — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) September 4, 2022 The former Conservative MP said he had spoken to both No 10 and Tory leadership candidates Ms Truss and Mr Sunak before publicly confirming his decision.“We now have the permanent machinery in place to deal with human misery coming to this country from wherever they come from without the need for a designated minister to be in charge,” he said.I’m not walking out on the role or either candidate and will continue to support where helpful. But what I was specifically asked to do is essentially complete Lord Harrington “With monthly reports for the Secretary of State, whoever he or she may be, there should now be a permanent delivery mechanism. “Never again will we have people arrive in the UK and go into hotels without a plan, as happened with those coming from Afghanistan and from the Ukraine, where at the beginning we didn’t have any idea where to put them all.” He said he will take on a voluntary role helping refugees after he leaves government. More than 100,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK since the invasion began. “I was brought in to do a very specific job, which was to set up working machinery across Government to deal with helping the Ukrainians in need,” Lord Harrington said. “I believe we now have a process and procedure in place that means there won’t necessarily be the need for a minister like myself. “I’m not walking out on the role or either candidate and will continue to support where helpful. But what I was specifically asked to do is essentially complete so it seems right that I make clear to both leadership contenders that they may be able to save on a ministerial post when they take over. “Or at least have the option to shape the role for the next phase with a new person now I’ve established a successful system.” Mr Johnson tweeted on Sunday evening: “Thank you, Richard, for your work on welcoming 120,000 Ukrainian refugees to the UK, following Putin’s war in Ukraine. “Your wealth of experience in government will be sorely missed.” Other Tory MPs paid tribute to Lord Harrington on Sunday, with former health secretary Sajid Javid tweeting: “I saw first hand how you did a brilliant job, helping thousands of desperate people. Thank you.” And Caroline Nokes tweeted: “You worked so hard on this Richard and I have always welcomed your willingness to engage and discuss all the challenges for refugees.” Mr Johnson, who leaves office on Tuesday, has been praised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He wrote a piece in the Mail On Sunday and also spoke to the Sunday Times about his gratitude to the outgoing prime minister. He also expressed his hope for future “close relations” with Mr Johnson’s successor, who could be in line for an invitation to visit Kyiv.  Mr Zelenksy told the Sunday Times that it would be a “priority” to extend an invitation to the next prime minister, while he also admitted he was “concerned” when he heard Mr Johnson was resigning. “When we learned that there would be a change of government, all of us were concerned,” he told the paper. “Johnson was supporting us and a lot depends on the leader. The leader is the one who communicates. The leader is the one that mediates between a country and its people, and a leader has an impact upon society.” Speaking about Mr Johnson’s successor, he said of that relationship: “I can only pray that it will be at the same level as I had with prime minister Johnson.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-09,NA,NA
1955,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,14/3/2022,821 words,ADAM FORREST,Sponsor route for Ukrainian refugees criticised for being 'too slow and cumbersome',"Refugee charities said the government's new sponsorship route for Ukrainian refugees falls short of the response required, as fears grow that it will be too ""slow and cumbersome"" to meet the scale of the crisis. Cabinet minister Michael Gove said he hoped ""tens of thousands"" would be able to use the route set to be opened up this week, as he announced that local authority areas would get £10,000 per Ukrainian refugee sponsored in their area. The minister for levelling up said he hoped individuals and community groups would be able to ""match"" with refugees using social media, adding that charities would help in the process. But opposition parties said the scheme - which will also provide £350 per month to Britons who provide homes to Ukrainian refugees - placed too much of the burden on the public and community groups. Labour cautioned that ""too many questions remain unanswered"" about the new scheme - and ridiculed its reliance on social media. Shadow levelling up minister Lisa Nandy told LBC: ""We're asking people to ask to take to social media at a time they're fleeing a war zone. This is a serious crisis - it's not an online dating situation."" Labour leader Sir KeirStarmerclaimed the government's handling of refugees fleeing Ukraine was ""far tooslow, fartoomean"" and had been ""an embarrassment for the United Kingdom"". Questioning the lack of detail in the sponsorship plan, Sir Keir told Sky News: ""What would comfort me more frankly is if I heard from Michael Gove that there were plans in place for the support that's actually going to be needed on arrival."" The Refugee Council said ministers were still putting too many ""bureaucratic hurdles"" in the way of those in danger. Chief executive Enver Solomon said the new scheme ""falls short"" of what is needed and would ""inevitably be restricted to those who are known to people in the UK"". Louise Calvey of Refugee Action said the government were ""tinkering at the margins"" and had not set out a ""well resourced"" programme that deals with the scale of the refugee crisis now enveloping Europe. Mr Gove told Sky News the public could register interest in housing a refugee on a newly launched website, and said he expects the first refugees making use of the route to come to the UK ""in a week's time"". Asked how sponsors and refugees were supposed the find each other, the minister told Sky News'Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the government believed they could try to form links on Instagram or Twitter. ""We know charities, and we are working with them, who are working to identify people on the ground, and helping to identify people here to create the matching process,"" he added. Sponsors will be expected to guarantee a minimum stay of six months - but will be encouraged to keep up the offer for as long as they can. Both those offering accommodation and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks. Sponsored refugees will be granted 36 months leave to remain in the UK, and will be entitled to work, benefits and public services. Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said councils ""will be central in helping families settle into their communities"". He called on Mr Gove's department to work closely with local leaders so the scheme ""can move at pace and scale"". First minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said yesterday that Scotland ""stands ready"" to take 3,000 Ukrainian refugees immediately as a ""super sponsor"". But Ms Sturgeon said she was worried the UK sponsorship scheme would be too ""slow and cumbersome"", and may not be sustainable for the length of time that people may need to stay in the UK. When Asked on BBC'sSunday Morningprogramme if Mr Gove would take someone in, he said: ""I'm exploring what I can do, I know that there are others who have. Without going into my personal circumstances, there are a couple of things I need to sort out - but yes."" Mr Gove said yesterday that ""more than 3,000 visas"" have now been issued to those fleeing the war with family in the UK, as the government came in for more criticism over its failure to follow the EU approach and waive visa requirements. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was time for Boris Johnson to sack home secretary PritiPatelover her department's handling of the Ukrainian refugee crisis. ""Her inaction does not befit the British people, with all our compassion and generosity,"" he told his party's spring conference. ""It couldn't be clearer that PritiPatelis not up to the job. The buck stops with the prime minister. So Boris Johnson must sack her, now."" Ireland's premier Micheal Martin said his country's humanitarian response trumps security checks on arriving Ukrainians. ""Our primary impulse is to assist those fleeing war,"" he told the BBC. The Taoiseach has said the state has so far accepted 5,500 people fleeing the Russian invasion, a response to what he termed ""the worst displacement of people since World War Two"".",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy

Aodha,UK’s Rwanda scheme ‘wrong’ and may put pressure on Ireland – Martin,"Irish premier Micheal Martin has said the UK Government’s Rwanda scheme may have resulted in an increase in international protection applicants in the Republic. The Taoiseach made the comments after it emerged on Wednesday night that Ireland had a “severe shortage” of state accommodation for Ukrainian refugees. Speaking from Government Buildings on Thursday, Mr Martin said that of those at the reception centre for Ukrainians at Citywest in Dublin , 70% are now international protection applicants. “We will be analysing this, but something has happened in the last two to three months in terms of the surge within international protection applicants, something has clearly happened,” the Taoiseach said. “Anecdotally or intuitively, one can see, and maybe sense that that policy announcement, which I thought was a wrong policy announcement by the UK, a shocking sort of initiative in my view, to be doing some agreement with Rwanda, clearly may have motivated people utilising the Common Travel Area to come into the Republic – yes, I think it is one of a number of factors.” The Taoiseach made the comments as he and the Minister for Housing , Darragh O’Brien, announced a progress update on the Housing for All plan. Mr O’Brien said “real progress” had been made, “despite significant headwinds”. “Commencements are up, permissions are up, completions are up, and thankfully people are now drawing down more mortgages than they have in over a decade. First-time buyers are at their highest level since 2007.”Speaking after announcement of a 50 million euro Croi Conaithe (Towns) Fund, which aims to bring vacant and underused buildings in towns and villages back into use, Mr O’Brien said of the Croi Conaithe (Cities) Scheme: “It’s a targeted support that goes to homeowners by reducing the purchasing price of an apartment. It will directly ensure that over 5000 new apartments will be built for owner-occupiers. “I’m very glad to say, as the Taoiseach alluded to, that there has been substantial interest from the sector in this scheme, and it has the potential to bring fresh life into our cities over the coming years.” It comes as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has called on the Irish government to “urgently” provide emergency accommodation for refugees. Enda O’Neill, Head of Office with UNHCR Ireland, said the Government needed to make “significant” investment. “The Government is to be commended for its efforts to date in providing accommodation to the tens of thousands who have arrived in Ireland this year fleeing war and persecution,” he said. “However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the current approach of contracting accommodation from the private sector has reached its limits. “Significant investment is now required by the Government to ensure that it has the capacity to meet the immediate need for shelter of new arrivals and to provide safeguards for the protection of children and other categories of vulnerable people.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-07,1,Policy

According to the United Nations, more than 3 million Ukrainians - including half the country's children - have left since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade one month ago. Mr Biden is expected to make the announcement on Thursday from Brussels, Belgium, where he has traveled to attend an extraordinary Nato summit and meet with the European Council to discuss the West's response to the ongoing crisis. A decision to accept such a large number of refugees would be one of the largest influxes of refugees into the US in recent years, and would come after criticism that Mr Biden and the United States have not done enough to absorb the massive flow of persons who've been displaced by Russian forces over the last four weeks.  On 12 March, Polish president Andrzej Duda called on the US to ""speed up"" the processing of Ukrainian refugees who have relatives already living in the US during a joint appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris.  According to US census data, more than 350,000 Ukrainian immigrants currently reside in the United States. At the time, Mr Duda said the crisis would ""end up in a refugee disaster"" if the US did not act swiftly. But despite promises from Mr Biden to welcome refugees with open arms, his administration has not taken the sorts of public steps that would signal openness to a large flow of displaced persons.  Instead, Biden Administration officials have stressed that the US response to the crisis thus far has been to support efforts by Poland and other neighbouring countries to accept refugees who cross from Ukraine via land borders.  The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

Nadia El-Nakla, an SNP councillor in Dundee , told the Guardian newspaper her sister-in-law has been able to take refuge in Turkey with the couple’s four children, who are aged between six months and nine years. But she said her brother’s name was removed from the list provided by the Turkish administration – meaning the emergency doctor must remain in the war-torn region alongside his 93-year-old grandmother, who requires round-the-clock care. Ms El-Nakla, who is married to Humza Yousaf , is now urging the UK Government to allow those with family in Britain to live in the UK while the conflict with Israel continues. I feel like a second-class citizen in my own country, because I don’t have the right to bring my own brother to stay in my own home Nadia El-Nakla She told the Guardian: “The Ukrainian resettlement programme saved so many lives. Gazans should also have that opportunity, especially those with family in Britain. “I feel like a second-class citizen in my own country, because I don’t have the right to bring my own brother to stay in my own home. “I can see people across the street hosting Ukrainian families, and rightly so, But I can’t host my own brother, to me that feels beyond upsetting.” But Ms El-Nakla, who attended a summit of leaders’ spouses in Istanbul prior to her family’s escape, said she is “so grateful” her sister-in-law and her children are safe, adding: “My brother keeps thanking me for saving his kids.” The politician has been outspoken about her family’s situation in Gaza, regularly joining Mr Yousaf in calling for a ceasefire. Her parents – Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla – were in Gaza visiting relatives at the time of the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel and the subsequent initial retaliation. They were trapped with limited supplies for almost a month before being granted permission to leave through Egypt along with other British nationals. They returned to Dundee, but remain “traumatised” by their experience, Ms El-Nakla said, and they have now travelled to Turkey to support their daughter-in-law. Meanwhile, Ms El-Nakla said her brother continues to work in dangerous circumstances. “There’s nothing I can say to comfort him,” she told the newspaper. “I said to him remember the line from the Koran that says with difficulty comes ease, and that ease should come soon. He replied: ‘I say that line about 100 times a day.’ “They’re just so tired of it. There’s no respite.”",Broadsheet,0,2024-01,1,Migration

Mr Jenrick is among the first MPs to have managed to get a Ukrainian family to the UK, with Tory North Norfolk MP Duncan Baker announcing earlier this month that he had welcomed a mother and her son. But Mr Jenrick said the process by which Maria , 40, and her two children, Bohdan, 15, and Khrystyna, 11, had got to the UK was ""traumatic"". Their father has stayed in Ukraine to fight in the war.  ""We want to support them for as long as long as they need to be here.""@RobertJenrick MP speaks to @christopherhope about the Ukrainian family staying with his family. Listen to the latest #ChoppersPolitics here https://t.co/qb1xtLCmtM pic.twitter.com/jSSkB0Eegs - The Telegraph (@Telegraph) April 15, 2022 Environment minister Victoria Prentis took in a 25-year-old Ukrainian refugee last month under a separate visitor visa scheme, while other MPs and ministers have said they have applied to host families. Mr Jenrick told the Telegraph's Chopper's Politics podcast: ""It has been a very difficult experience for them. Even the experience of coming here was traumatic. ""They spent seven hours queuing at the Polish border before they were able to finally leave Ukraine, catch the flight to the UK, and the experiences which they've had and their relatives have had in different parts of the country over the last two or three months are really harrowing."" On the process, he said: ""Truth be told it has been a bumpy start to the scheme. It's taken too long to get visas, for us it took about three weeks to get all three visas approved. ""And so there are people who are frustrated, it has tested the patience of sponsors and, more importantly, of the families and individuals themselves. ""But having been involved in some schemes that are not dissimilar to this in the past, like the Hong Kong scheme, Syrian scheme, Afghan scheme as a minister, as communities secretary, I know that. But I do think that we will get over those bumps, we are getting over them now."" Mr Jenrick said the scheme as it stands is ""overly bureaucratic"". He added: ""There were simple things that we could and should have done from the outset, like having the form in Ukrainian, for example. ""And I'm not sure whether you need to be doing checks on minors who are extremely unlikely to be threats to this country."" He said some security checks are needed, but added: ""The checks need to be done quickly and in this case I'm afraid it has taken too long."" Mr Jenrick said he has not yet received the £350 he is entitled to for hosting the family, but if it is offered he will either not accept it or pass it directly to the refugees. ""So far... it's been very rewarding to see them feeling safe at last after a very traumatic experience and beginning to stabilise them and rebuild their lives,"" he said. Former health secretary Matt Hancock said last week he is planning to take in seven Ukrainian refugees at his Suffolk home. He said the visa process had been a ""challenge"". Around 16,400 people had arrived in the UK under Ukraine visa schemes by Monday, according to Government figures. About 13,200 had arrived under the Ukraine family scheme and 3,200 under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, provisional data shows.

Researchers from the ONE Campaign said the Russian invasion has destroyed the government's rationale for cutting aid spending from the level of 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent of gross national income in 2020. The non-profit group has called on chancellor Rishi Sunak to bring forward the planned restoration of the 0.7 per cent figure, warning that failure to do so will mean life-saving programmes will be withdrawn from some of the world's poorest nations. The Ukrainian war means that the UK will no longer be able to meet its strategic priorities and international obligations within the reduced budget, it added.  Some £220m of UK aid money has been diverted so far to meet immediate humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the disruption to Ukrainian wheat exports, which make up 10 per cent of global supply, has sent food prices soaring around the world, including in developing countries. ONE UK director Romilly Greenhill said it was ""absolutely the case"" that refugees fleeing Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine need to be supported as much as people facing famine in east Africa do. But she said ""by keeping our aid budget unnecessarily reduced, the UK is not in a position to do both; it's forcing itself into a situation where it has to choose between people in crisis,"" adding that ""we're seeing a convergence of crises that mean you can't just pick and choose which problem to deal with in a vacuum"". The aid cut - equivalent to £4.5bn a year - was described as a ""temporary"" measure. Mr Sunak has said he hopes to restore spending to its previous level in 2024-25, but Ms Greenhill said this timetable needs to be accelerated. A report by ONE found that a series of humanitarian disasters, including the Ukraine refugee crisis and the controversial decision to include Covid vaccines in the aid budget, had made the argument for the cut increasingly ""out of date"". The group's report comes days before Mr Sunak's mini-budget statement on Wednesday and ahead of the expected publication of the Foreign Office's international development strategy. ""We're in a different place to when the aid budget was first cut,"" said Ms Greenhill. ""Since the chancellor announced the cut in 2020, circumstances have changed, and the justification that was used then no longer holds. ""The government cannot deliver on its own agenda at the current budget, and with more and more spend being added, UK aid is being stretched to breaking point. It's pushing existing anti-poverty work out."" ONE's analysis, carried out before the invasion of Ukraine, found that the decision to cut UK aid meant 4 million fewer girls will have access to a decent education and that 1 million women and children under five will be at risk of malnutrition. It also found that aid to low-income countries like Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen had been slashed, while some middle-income countries like China and Brazil saw a rise in funds received. UK overseas development aid to Ethiopia fell by 55 per cent from £240.5m in 2020-21 to £107.5m in 2021-22, while China's funding rose from £2.2m to £13.7m in the same period, the report found. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has a long history of helping other countries in need and we are one of the largest aid spenders globally. ""We are leading the world in protecting people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and have already provided £220 million in aid, including for life-saving medical supplies, shelter and hygiene kits."" ""International development remains a core FCDO priority and we will return to 0.7 per cent as soon as the fiscal situation allows.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,0,Policy

Tim Boniface and his partner Jayne Coppinger are one of five households in Wysall, a village near Nottingham , sponsoring Ukrainian families under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. After weeks of waiting they are now experiencing further delays because family members' visas are coming through at different times, despite them applying on the same day. I am talking to my family daily, they are broken, they ask 'what is the problem? Jayne Coppinger The couple helped a mother and her two children apply over a month ago on March 22, but while Kataryna, 37, had her visa approved this week her four-year-old daughter and son, 14, are still waiting. The boy is now saying he may return to his father in Ukraine because he has ""no confidence in UK government to help them in their times of need"". Mr Boniface said he and his partner are ""at their wits' end"". He told the PA news agency: ""Jayne has constantly been working on keeping Kataryna's spirits high and thought when her visa was granted that we had finally come to an end of the turmoil, to find out that the children's visas have not been processed."" Ms Coppinger said the family has been living in temporary accommodation in Poland after fleeing Ukraine in early March, but they had to move out and seek new shelter in mid-April, which has caused them ""a huge amount of distress"". Kataryna is having to inject herself with pain relief for her back, she said, describing the mother as ""near breaking point with the pain, lack of sleep, uncertainty but still having to find the strength to single parent her children"". In one of several emails sent to the Home Office , her local MP and council, Ms Coppinger said: ""I am talking to my family daily, they are broken, they ask 'what is the problem?'. ""I have no answers, but I am determined that if they do return to the Ukraine their blood will not be on my hands, as I have tried every avenue, am suffering myself with anxiety as to how to help the family.

The 53-year-old from London has organised a vigil outside the Home Office on Saturday afternoon - five weeks and one day since the Homes for Ukraine scheme started accepting visa applications - calling for an end to ""cynical and deadly"" delays. The group of would-be sponsors said they are hearing stories of ""lost visas"", frustrations at a lack of information and MPs lobbying ""fruitlessly"" on behalf of their constituents. They said they are particularly concerned about a growing number of cases where some family members have received visas while others are still waiting, despite applying at the same time.

Matt Westfall, 52, raised more than £11,000 to get six black cabs, one car, and one van across to Poland to deliver humanitarian aid to refugee camps set up near the Ukrainian border, and transport refugees trying to reach cities across Europe. Mr Westfall, who has been a taxi driver in London for 11 years, arrived home on Wednesday and said ""there are no words"" to describe the four-day trip. ""I've not got a big enough vocabulary to tell you how I felt,"" the 52-year-old from Buckhurst Hill, Essex told the PA news agency. ""Pain, heartbreak, relief... It changed me forever. ""I can't comprehend what they've been through, all I can do is try and smile and do what I can for them... There's no words."" Mr Westfall decided to launch a GoFundMe for the cause when he saw a video online of a Ukrainian father saying goodbye to his family as he left them to enlist in the military. With the help of more than £6,700 donated by strangers on the fundraising site and contributions from the London Taxi Drivers' Association and Eclipse Rent-A-Taxi, Mr Westfall set off on Sunday with a group of taxi drivers he had recruited for the task. The group drove 13 hours to Warsaw , Poland where they delivered aid such as sanitary products, baby food, nappies, and toilet roll, and picked up two families per vehicle to drive back across the continent. ""I had a mum and daughter in my cab, they were going to Munich... Three families were going to Hamburg where they have family and friends,"" Mr Westfall explained. ""There were two ladies, I didn't know where they were going... We didn't want to be too intrusive in their lives."" ""And one (driver) is in Dunkirk now, they're waiting on visas... they've got sponsors, family in Notting Hill, so (he is) waiting until they've got a visa and he will drive them to Notting Hill either today or tomorrow."" We asked the lady in our taxi, 'Do you think you'll go back?' and she said, 'To what? My flat is gone. Matt Westfall With money donated to the GoFundMe, Mr Westfall was able to pay and put a few of the refugees they transported up in a hotel, allowing them to wash and eat. He described the emotional conversation he had with a Ukrainian mother he took to Munich. ""We asked the lady in our taxi, 'Do you think you'll go back?' and she said, 'To what? My flat is gone, I've got nothing to go back to - I don't know what to do.' ""She said, 'I would love to go back to my country, I really want to go back but I have nothing to go back to.' ""She has family in Munich and that's where she is now, so I think they're going to be starting a new life in Germany."" Mr Westfall also spoke about the moment that will ""live with (him) forever"" when transporting the woman and her young daughter. ""This little dot, she didn't want to talk... She looked very grey and pasty and tired,"" he said. ""Her mum said, 'I'm quite worried really, she's not eaten, not drunk anything.' ""So my mate got down on his knee and said: 'I know what all kids like... McDonalds'."" ""Her little eyes just lit up like switching on a light and it was just amazing... Her little face lit up and all of sudden we had a different little girl on our hands. ""It was amazing moment that summed up the journey, it was worth it just for that one little moment."" The group stopped at McDonalds on the way to Berlin, after which the young girl fell asleep on her mother as Mr Westfall continued to drive the pair to the German capital. ""It was just lovely... She slept all the way to Berlin, 12 hours, she must have felt safe."" ""We put them in a hotel and my mate just had a message from the mum and the daughter, they're with their family now in Munich, they sent us a picture.""

1907,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,28/7/2022,610 words,May Bulman,"Number of Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Britain tops 100,000","The number of Ukrainian refugees who have been granted sanctuary in the UK’s since the start of Vladimir Putin ’s invasion has topped 100,000 for the first time, figures show. Government data released on Thursday shows that 104,000 people have arrived in Britain under Britain’s two Ukrainian refugee programmes – 31,300 under the family scheme and 72,700 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The figures also show that, as of Tuesday, around 198,200 applications have been made for visas , and 166,200 visas have been issued. This leaves 32,000 people still waiting for decisions on their applications, and 62,200 who have been granted but are yet to arrive in the UK. The numbers are considerably higher than the volume of people who have come to the UK under other refugee schemes. The Syrian resettlement scheme, which ended in 2021, welcomed 20,000 refugees, and the two schemes for Afghans – the Afghan Relocation Assistance Policy (ARAP) and the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) – have welcomed around 19,000 so far, including those evacuated during Operation Pitting. Robina Qureshi, executive officer at Positive Action in Housing, a charity that has been matching refugees and asylum seekers with hosts in the UK for decades, said she welcomed the high numbers. But she added: “Ukrainians aren’t the only refugees. There’s this narrative that they’re the only legitimate ones, but there are many from other countries – Yemen Syria, Iraq. And they have the threat of the Rwanda plan facing them. “People arriving on the Channel are in the main refugees, either fleeing war or persecution, and they are left in limbo and fear. It’s concerning that we are unable to help them. “We hope that now that this model has been established, the government will look at Homes for Yemen, Homes for Syria, because there is no safe route for these people.” While the numbers granted sanctuary under the Ukrainian refugee schemes are relatively high, there are also concerns about the support people receive once they arrive. Data from a recent survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that only 37 per cent of Ukrainian refugees reported that they have enough money to support themselves and their dependents for the next three months. Separate data, published by the government in June, showed that 660 households who have come to Britain via the Ukraine routes have been forced to register as homeless. The Independent revealed in May that thousands of Ukrainians seeking refuge in the UK had been forced to live in overcrowded accommodation, with whole families sharing single rooms. Local authorities are given £10,500 in central government funding for each refugee under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, but receive no money for those arriving under the family route. Calls are mounting for councils to be given funding to support those arriving under the family scheme, and for the government to allow refugees on this scheme to be able to switch to the Homes for Ukraine route, which it pledged to do earlier this month. Labour MP Clive Betts, who chairs the Levelling Up Committee, wrote to the refugees minister last week demanding an update on when the government would fulfil its pledge to enable people to switch from the family scheme to the Homes for Ukraine scheme Mr Betts said: “As a committee, we have heard of difficulties arising with the rematching process within the Homes for Ukraine scheme when accommodation is found to be unsuitable and when there appears to be perverse application of the rules, with families unable to switch. “Refugee families need a proper home, not a hotel bedroom or temporary bed and breakfast.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-07,0,Policy

Many of those who are supporting Ukrainian refugees through Government schemes are struggling to afford to continue hosting people amid the cost-of-living crisis, the British Red Cross said. The charity called for hosts to be given more financial support and noted the numbers of Ukrainians facing the risk of homelessness as sponsorship arrangements come to an end.  People across the UK have demonstrated the power of kindness by opening their homes to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, but there have been various shortcomings in the UK’s response which need to be urgently addressed, finds @RedCrossPolicy #UkraineOneYearOn pic.twitter.com/ZOHYJWS62P — British Red Cross Policy (@RedCrossPolicy) February 24, 2023 The latest official figures show that 4,295 Ukrainian households have needed assistance from councils in the face of homelessness.A Government spokesperson said the fact the UK had welcomed more than 162,000 Ukrainians to safety since the outbreak of the war a year ago demonstrates “the extraordinary generosity of the British public”.They said the visa schemes specially set up for Ukrainian arrivals were “designed to address the various needs of those hoping to seek refuge here”.They added: “In all cases local authorities have a legal duty to ensure no families are left without a roof over their heads.”Gaps in support and barriers to securing accommodation are also making life hard for Ukrainian families, who are already dealing with the emotional impact of the conflictBritish Red CrossThe Homes for Ukraine Scheme sees people sponsored by a UK household for six months, while the Ukraine Family Scheme is for those with family already settled in the UK.Up to February 20, a total of 163,500 people had arrived to the UK under both schemes.There were 47,800 arrivals via the Ukraine Family Scheme and 115,800 via Homes for Ukraine.The Government noted that under the Homes for Ukraine scheme it is giving councils per-person funding, as well as £150 million to support guests into their own homes and £500 million to find housing.It also announced an increase in December in so-called “thank you” payments to sponsors of £500 a month for guests who have been in the country for more than a year.But the Red Cross said that increase could come “too late, and won’t always be enough”.We support hospitals affected by conflict not only with medical supplies, but also with forensic aspects.We donated a refrigerated container to a hospital in #Kherson region. Helping to ensure that bodies are treated with dignity is an important part of our role. pic.twitter.com/pfcKU2vj6M — ICRC Ukraine (@ICRC_ua) February 22, 2023 The charity called on the Government to clarify the details and allocation of the £150 million one-off funding for local authorities so they can address growing housing needs, and to ensure both hosts and displaced Ukrainians under the family scheme are given the same support as those on the Homes for Ukraine Scheme. The Red Cross also urged the Government to “immediately increase monthly payments for all hosts in line with the rising cost of living” and to look at schemes supporting Ukrainians with deposits to move into the private rented sector. Mike Adamson , British Red Cross chief executive, said: “One year on since the conflict in Ukraine escalated, many displaced people in the UK are still living with their hosts, finding jobs and settling into life here. “But many others are struggling. We must ensure the warm welcome shown by thousands of people is recognised and built on, so we don’t see more families facing homelessness on top of trauma. “We should not have a situation where the type of visa you arrived on determines whether or not your host family receives support. This is putting huge pressure on families in the UK who are doing their best to help, especially with rising bills and food costs. “Gaps in support and barriers to securing accommodation are also making life hard for Ukrainian families, who are already dealing with the emotional impact of the conflict.” Acknowledging the successes of the Government’s efforts towards Ukrainians, in helping them to quickly and safely escape and seek protection in the UK, the charity’s report also states that lessons could be learned for future operations. The charity said it is encouraging policymakers to consider how safe routes could be expanded to other refugees seeking safety. Mr Adamson said: “While there are problems that need addressing, the UK’s response to the conflict in Ukraine demonstrates what’s possible when we provide safe routes for people in need of protection. “Notably, no Ukrainians were recorded as crossing the English Channel according to the most recent data. The UK Government should now take stock to improve the way it responds to refugees fleeing conflict, violence and persecution in other countries too.”",Broadsheet,0,2023-02,1,Policy
3234,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,29/6/2022,1145 words,Matt Mathers,Inside Politics: Noisy court,"Wimbledon is well underway, with Serena Williams and Harmony Tan serving up a cracking match in SW19 last night. Boris Johnson is contending with a noisy court at home, as defence secretary Ben Wallace ramps up calls for extra spending as the PM attends the Nato summit in Madrid. Elsewhere, Nicola Sturgeon has set out a proposed date for a second referendum on Scottish independence.  Inside the bubble   Our political commentator Andrew Grice on what to look out for today:  There’s no cabinet meeting this week, and so no opportunity for the ministerial mice to play while Boris Johnson continues his eight-day, three-summit tour at Nato’s meeting in Madrid. But prime minister’s questions carries on in his absence, as a battle of the deputies: Dominic Raab versus Angela Rayner. The deputy PM will come armed with Rayner’s supportive remarks about strikes. Questions to Scottish Office ministers will cover Nicola Sturgeon’s plans for an independence referendum in October next year. Ministers appearing at select committees include George Eustice (on environmental protection); Richard Harrington (Ukrainian refugees) and Anne-Marie Trevelyan (the trade deal with Australia). Sajid Javid will announce a digital health and care plan to tackle Covid backlogs. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, will address the Local Government Association’s conference in Harrogate on the financial problems facing councils.  Daily Briefing   With or without you  Nicola Sturgeon is proposing 19 October 2023 as the date for another referendum on Scottish independence. The SNP leader, who said the question would be the same as the one on the last ballot – “Should Scotland be an independent country?”, has written to Boris Johnson asking for permission to hold the vote. This is because UK constitutional matters are reserved for the government in London. So far, the prime minister has refused to grant something called a section 30 order, which would give Sturgeon the power to hold the vote, saying that now is not the time for another divisive election campaign – some 8 years after Scots voted to stay in the union. That position is unlikely to change following the SNP leader’s address to SNPs in Holyrood yesterday. In a move that has somewhat blindsided Johnson, Sturgeon conceded that the legality of holding a second referendum without consent from London – a “wildcat poll”, like the one seen in Spain’s Catalonia region in 2017 – was contested and demanded an urgent ruling from the supreme court in London. “What I am not willing to do, what I will never do, is allow Scottish democracy to be a prisoner of Boris Johnson or any prime minister,” Sturgeon said. Whatever your views on Scottish independence, the move by Sturgeon is clever politics for several reasons. Firstly, it eases pressure on the FM from the grassroots of her party, who are demanding another poll despite most recent polls showing that there is no majority for independence. Secondly, Sturgeon has got ahead by referring the matter herself to the court, where the issue probably would have ended up anyway. If judges rule that the vote is legal, she gets what she wants and the poll goes ahead. If they don’t, then Sturgeon will use the decision as a recruiting sergeant for the independence cause and she has vowed to fight the next general election campaign on that single issue. If she wins that election with a majority she will then say that she has a democratic mandate for independence. One way or the other, it looks like there will be a vote on Scotland’s future. The court has confirmed that it has received the referral from the Scottish government’s lord advocate, although it did not put a date on when it would respond.  Defence row  Johnson, with his in-tray already overflowing, responded to Sturgeon’s call by saying that she should focus on getting the economy back on track as he argued that the UK is “stronger together”. The PM is well into his sojourn abroad as questions about his future continue at home. He landed in Madrid last night for the Nato summit and will meet with other leaders there today to discuss Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. But his trip on the world stage threatens to be overshadowed by yet another cabinet row –this time on defence spending. As the PM issued a grand call to his counterparts at the summit to step up Nato spending, Ben Wallace, his own defence secretary, criticised the UK’s “smoke and mirrors” military budget. Wallace said UK forces had for too long survived on “a diet of smoke and mirrors, hollowed-out formations and fantasy savings” – after calling for the PM to commit to a 20 per cent spending increase. “If governments historically responded every time the NHS has a winter crisis so must they when the threat to the very security which underpins our way of life increases,” Wallace told the Royal United Services Institute think tank. Labour also accused the PM of “breaking” his own 2019 manifesto promise on defence spending, after a senior government source said the pledge to hike annual military spending by 0.5 per cent above inflation may no longer be met.  On the record  “My determination is to secure a process that allows the people of Scotland, whether yes, no or yet to be decided, to express their views in a legal, constitutional referendum so the majority view can be established fairly and democratically.”  Sturgeon sets out date for second referendum campaign.   From the Twitterati  “The fact the Met is now formally in special measures makes it seem all the more remarkable that Boris Johnson and Priti Patel were so keen to keep Cressida Dick in post.”  George Parker, FT politics editor, on the news that the Metropolitan Police service has been placed in special measures.

Moscow made the emergency order last month to move 95,739 people of the Russian Federation, Ukraine , Donetsk, and Lugansk away from the war zones to be resettled as far as 5,500 miles away from their homes, the Kremlin decree seen by The i stated. It comes amid several reports that Russian forces have allegedly forcibly disappeared, held captive or interrogated people in Ukrainian towns since Mr Putin's invasion of the country on 24 February.  The decree stated that ""taking into account the current situation"" in Ukraine, the Russian federation ""approves the distribution"" of citizens to the ""constituent entities of the Russian Federation"" and asked authorities to ""ensure the reception"" of 95,739 people. It included provisions to send 11,398 people to Siberia, 7,218 to the Far East and 7,023 to the North Caucasus, including other regions such as the heavily-militarised republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan. Citing separate documents, the report added that people in the port city of Mariupol were being asked to sign papers that claimed Ukrainian troops shelled their city. The signatories were reportedly told they cannot return to Ukraine because they will face ""persecution"". The number of Ukrainians that have been internally displaced has reachedover 7.1 million since the invasion of the country, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Sima Bahous, director of UN Women, said the ""mass displacement with the large presence of conscripts and mercenaries, and the brutality displayed against Ukrainian civilians, has raised all red flags"". Demanding an end to the war, she said: ""We are increasingly hearing of rape and sexual violence. These allegations must be independently investigated to ensure justice and accountability."" Meanwhile, an eight-mile convoy of Russian troops seen in satellite imagery heading towards Ukraine's Donbas region is the latest evidence to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's claim that Russia is preparing for renewed attacks. Mr Zelensky said Russia's war on Ukraine could be entering a ""new stage of terror"" citing threats from the use of chemical weapons in the besieged city of Mariupol. The Ukrainian parliament also said that it received reports of Russian forces firing ""nitric acid"" in the Donetsk region. It follows inputs from British intelligence on Monday that warned of the potential use of phosphorous by Russian forces in Mariupol. The US Defence Department has said they are monitoring the unconfirmed reports of the use of chemical munitions. ""These reports, if true, are deeply concerning and reflective of concerns that we have had about Russia's potential to use a variety of riot control agents, including tear gas mixed with chemical agents, in Ukraine,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said.

The policy has been widely criticised by human rights charities and even faced backlash from Tory backbenchers, former prime minister Theresa May and the Archbishop of Canterbury.  The government said it is braced for a flurry of legal claims as it prepares to send migrants to the east African nation within a fortnight. In the interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson said the migrants have already been served ""notices of intent,"" marking the start of the process. ""There's going to be a lot of legal opposition from the types of firms that for a long time have been taking taxpayers' money to mount these sorts of cases, and to thwart the will of the people, the will of parliament,"" Mr Johnson said.  ""We're ready for that. We will dig in for the fight - we will make it work. We've got a huge flowchart of things we have to do to deal with it with the leftie lawyers."" The controversial policy has faced heavy scrutiny since it was announced with the latest reports claimingLGBT+ refugees sent to Rwanda could face persecution and Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia's invasion could also be sent to east Africa.  The Home Office's equality impact assessment for the policy, published this week, states that there are ""concerns"" over the treatment of some LGBTQ+ people, and that investigations point to ""ill treatment"" of this group being ""more than a one-off"". The document also reveals that some asylum seekers in Rwanda are forced to wait years for a decision and two-thirds are ultimately rejected. Meanwhile, immigration minister Tom Pursglove said that decisions to ship asylum seekers to the east African country would be considered on a ""case by case basis"" - and did not deny that people who have fled Ukraine could be among them. During an evidence hearing with the Home Affairs Select Committee, he also declined to rule out that Afghan nationals who worked alongside the British Army could be deported under the policy. Asked whether refugees who have escaped the Russian invasion could be among the cohort relocated, Mr Pursglove said: ""There is absolutely no reason why any Ukrainian should be getting in a small boat, paying a smuggler to get to the UK. ""People should be using those safe and legal routes that are available.

Myron Myronyuk stayed up all night at home in Pennsylvania as his twin brother tried to flee Kyiv , the Ukrainian capital, only to turn back because the road out was choked with traffic. His in-laws, also in Ukraine, told him they couldn't get basics like bread and milk. There was little Myronyuk could do but pray that his loved ones would survive the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A sense of helplessness overcame Ukrainians in America as the war unfolded half a world away, with little chance their loved ones in Ukraine would find refuge in the U.S. any time soon. For now, they are trying to donate money and supplies, desperately seeking advice from immigration attorneys about how to get family here and pleading for world leaders to intervene more forcefully. ""I say, 'We're praying for you, we wish you to be safe, go to a safe place,'"" said Myronyuk, pastor of St. Vladimir Ukrainian Catholic Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""We have to continue to pray and ask God for help,"" he said, but ""there's not much else we can do here."" Demonstrators gathered in Manhattan's Times Square and near the Russian Federation's mission to the United Nations on Thursday, waving blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags and denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin. About 100 people took to an overpass in Chicago , putting their hands to their hearts as the Ukrainian national anthem blared from a big speaker. ""The worst part is we cannot help them any more. We would send money, but everything is closed,"" said Chicago resident Hrystyna Klym, who has been in the U.S. for 15 years and has family in Ukraine. Klym volunteers with an organization that has regularly sent clothes, magazines, money and other items to help Ukraine's needy, particularly wounded soldiers, but she said there's no way to donate directly now. At Ukrainian Village Food & Deli in the Cleveland suburb of Parma Heights, Mila Radeva, 39, said her father - who lives near the Ukrainian port city of Odessa - had taken shelter in his basement as explosions rocked the area. ""A lot of people are going to die,"" said a worried Radeva, who emigrated to the U.S. 20 years ago. Asked if her father and other relatives might flee to another country, she said: ""There's no place for them to run."" Ekaterina Mouratova, a Miami immigration attorney, said Thursday was ""a crazy day,"" with phone calls and emails from Ukrainians and Russians seeking refuge in the United States. Ukrainians hope to flee Russian troops, while Russians worry they may get drafted and have bank accounts frozen in a wartime economy. She offered little encouragement, predicting Poland would be a far more realistic possibility for escape. ""There is no effective legal mechanism to bring people here,"" she said. Ukrainians could potentially flee their country, fly to Mexico from Europe as tourists, and enter the U.S. by land to claim asylum, as a growing number of Russians have done over the last year, Mouratova said. Fleeing war, however, is not considered legal grounds for asylum. Ukrainians could also be eligible for refugee resettlement - under which up to 125,000 can be accepted in the U.S. this year after being approved abroad - but processing has been slow as U.S. authorities focus on Afghans seeking to flee Taliban rule. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the U.S. was prepared to accept Ukrainian refugees, ""but we certainly expect that most if not the majority will want to go to Europe and neighboring countries."" Immigration advocates urged the Biden administration to grant Temporary Protected Status to Ukraine, a form of reprieve for its citizens already in the United States. The U.S. has granted TPS to 12 countries afflicted by war or natural disaster. Chicago immigration attorney Natalia Blauvelt, who also fielded calls from desperate Ukrainian clients, potential clients and friends, said they are ""absolutely devastated, extremely sad.... They are panicking because of what is happening in Ukraine, and many of them don't know what to do and help their relatives."" More than 1 million people in the U.S. report Ukrainian ancestry, according to the Census, with sizable populations in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Oksana Bilobran, an attorney in Seattle's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs, came to the U.S. from Ukraine 17 years ago. She and others have been urging elected officials to do more to support Ukraine, including securing a no-fly zone over the country and providing humanitarian protection for Ukrainians currently in the U.S. so they don't have to return. They are also working on ways to support Ukraine financially, since apps like Venmo and PayPal aren't readily available there. ""We need to up our fundraising to provide necessities, because the Ukrainian military is no match for the Russian army, so we need to provide as much help as we can here,"" she said. In Philadelphia, the United Ukrainian American Relief Committee - formed in World War II to help resettle Ukrainian refugees - pivoted to a wartime footing once again, readying a container packed with clothing, diapers, wheelchairs, medical supplies and personal hygiene items.

The Scottish First Minister said the option of housing refugees from the war in vacant military properties owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) ""must"" be considered. Speaking in the Scottish Parliament she said: ""The humanitarian crisis here and the scale of it means it is important that all housing options are fully explored. ""I believe MoD housing should be, must be, considered as part of this process."" She was asked about the issue by SNP MSP, Gordon MacDonald, who has already written to the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace , urging him to bring some 11,000 MoD homes that are not currently occupied, back into use. The Edinburgh Pentland MSP said: ""In my constituency, around the Dreghorn and Redford barracks, there are many MoD family homes that have been left empty for many years."" And he asked the First Minister to support his call for the ""UK Government to consider the use of hundreds of empty MoD homes in Edinburgh and across Scotland to house people being displaced as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine"". Ms Sturgeon said while the UK Government has sole responsibility for MoD properties, she would welcome ""making empty homes available to support displaced people from Ukraine"". We manage up to 16,000 service family moves every year, we need to retain vacant homes across the UK, but we are looking at what we can do around this MoD spokesman Speaking at First Minister's Questions, she added: ""The Scottish Government is already bringing together key partners to ensure effective co-ordination of plans to address the accommodation needs of people who are settling in Scotland, so we are committed to working with all partners to ensure all arrangements in place are safe, sustainable and offer true sanctuary for those fleeing the war."" In his letter to the Defence Secretary, Mr MacDonald said that"" it would be a failure of the Ministry of Defence not to utilise these properties to provide a safe, warm home for displaced Ukrainian people"". He urged the UK Government to ""take this forward as a priority, working with the Scottish Government and the local authorities"". An MoD spokesman said: ""The UK Government's Homes for Ukraine scheme has seen an unprecedented surge of public support, with sponsorship offers from across all four nations of the UK.

3131,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,10/1/2023,963 words,Holly Bancroft,Revealed: Exploitation fears as Homes for Ukraine scheme plagued by fake sponsor offers,"Councils have been flooded with bogus Ukraine refugee sponsorship offers and basic vetting checks have been missed putting refugees at risk of exploitation, a charity has warned. Half of all applications received by one London council were false while others were left scrambling to check the details of people who didn’t exist after government officials failed to verify prospective sponsors, a review has found. In one case, a council’s Homes for Ukraine (HfU) response team was sent to a kebab shop after fake addresses were given on the government’s expression of interest form. Another council had “Mickey Mouse” and “Vladimir Putin” sent as potential sponsors, while some refugees handed over tens of thousands of pounds to scammers. The report by migrants’ charity Work Rights Centre will be published on Tuesday but an extract shared exclusively with The Independent reveals that the Home Office had in some cases issued visas for Ukrainians before councils had time to conduct proper safety checks. The data and communication issues made exploitation a very real prospect for Ukrainians who arrived under the scheme, the charity said. Lisa Nandy MP, shadow levelling up, housing and communities secretary, said that government ministers were warned before its launch that a “DIY” Homes for Ukraine scheme would not be good enough.  “They ignored calls for the government to play a role matching sponsors and refugees and in enforcing safeguards to protect vulnerable people,” she said.  “This report lays bare the shameful consequences of the government’s failure to properly play its part,” Ms Nandy added.  The latest Home Office data on 15 December, showed 253,700 applications have been received, and 206,700 visas were granted under the Ukraine schemes. Of these, 175,000 were made and 145600 were issued under HfU. The report, titled On the frontline: London councils’ responses to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, drew from in-depth interviews with response teams from 12 council areas in London, which between them oversaw 36 per cent of HfU arrivals in the capital. Local authority officers shared disturbing examples of Ukrainian families who, eager to be matched with a sponsor as soon as possible, had fallen victim to scammers. One interviewee said: “A family paid £55,000 to someone in the UK who promised them a visa and a house. “The same thing happened to their cousin. Another person paid £2,000 for a visa, and was asked for £1,000 on arrival. We had to step in and stop it.” Without robust controls, any user with malicious intent could submit a fake expression of interest to the Department for Levelling Up, the report found.  One local government official told researchers: “At some point, there were so many applications, I thought it was Russian bots. “The so-called sponsor entries were noisy, email addresses were not real and the addresses used were often businesses ... It got to a point where we were asked to go out and visit these addresses which included a smoke shop, or a kebab shop.” They continued: “In the end, over half of the entries turned out to be completely false.” The percentage of viable hosts was much lower than the initial pool of interest, with one council estimating that “fewer than 10 per cent of sponsors who express interest actually respond”. There were also cases where real sponsors, who had volunteered to host one family, had their information used on multiple visa applications.  The report also found Home Office had often granted visas before sponsors had been properly checked, causing significant safeguarding concerns. In some cases, after sponsorship checks had failed, councils found the application had already been approved and the refugee had already arrived in the country. In at least one instance, a council had to stop a sponsorship arrangement when it came to light that the host had a criminal record.  “We have had to move a woman because of a sponsor’s DBS record,” they said. “In other cases, visas are issued for children before they are issued for parents, and the system looks like the children have left – then we call Ukraine to speak to the parents because we have interpreters, and find out that isn’t the case.” Adis Sehic, a co-author of the report, said it was clear that there was a “longer-term tension at play here between councils dealing with increased duties and responsibilities while facing diminishing resources at the same time”.  “The potential exploitation of Ukrainians highlighted by our research indicates that there has been a lack of strategic coordination at the level of central government departments, namely DLUHC and the Home Office, meaning that visa processing has been out of sync with local authority checks.” Georgia Gould, chair of London Councils, said: “Councils have faced – and continue to face – immense challenges, including in verifying information, ensuring arrivals are safeguarded, and securing appropriate accommodation for Ukrainians when their hosting arrangements come to an end.” A spokesperson for mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the report “rightly highlights that the design of this scheme left Ukrainians at risk”. “Local government and charities were forced to step in to ensure it was workable, and did an incredible job to meet the needs of thousands of Ukrainians in need of sanctuary,” they added. A government spokesperson said: “The Home Office only issues visas once robust checks have been completed. Councils are then required to conduct in-person welfare checks once a Ukrainian has arrived, and are alerted as soon as an application is made to complete DBS checks on all individuals in a sponsors’ household.” A government spokesperson added that it is “our priority has been to ensure those in danger can reach safety as quickly as possible”.

Lord Harrington, who was made a peer and appointed minister for refugees by the Prime Minister following criticism of the UK's Ukrainian refugee response, said the visa application process for those fleeing the war in eastern Europe was taking too long. But the Conservative peer told MPs that staff were working evening and weekends in a bid to speed up the process. A little under 60,000 applications have been received for both the Ukraine Family Scheme, where refugees can apply to be reunited with relatives already living in the UK, and the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, which allows individuals and other groups to offer accommodation to those wanting to travel to Britain. We have not got everything right Lord Harrington The Home Office confirmed on Wednesday that, as of March 29, the total number of visas issued was 25,500 - including 2,700 under the sponsorship scheme and 22,800 under the family scheme. Speaking to the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, Lord Harrington said: ""If I'm positive, I can say we've got 30,000 completed forms thereabouts. ""But we have not got everything right. It is not as seamless as it should be."" He added: ""We (the Home Office) are not trying to slow things up. The last time we looked, there were more than 300 staff and if we include both schemes, about 500 staff. ""We've started evening working, we've started weekend working. ""This is like an emergency operation. ""It is not that, 'Oh they will just have to wait' - it is people there who are desperate to come over, they've got through the system and we've got to get them here as quickly as possible."" Asked how many people had arrived as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme, the former Watford MP said it was ""too early to publish that data"" but vowed to write to the committee by early next week with the figures. He said he hoped civil servants would be able to process 15,000 applications per week via both schemes within the next three weeks. Lord Harrington - who was previously involved in the Syrian resettlement scheme - said there was a need for security checks to ensure Ukrainians applying ""are who they say they are"", but that questions such as ""are you a war criminal?"" had been removed from the standard form that had been used. ""There has been some talk, quite correctly in my view, that the visa application process, the actual filling it out, is too slow,"" Lord Harrington added. ""I agree with that. I sat down on Saturday morning and spent just under an hour filling one out myself, and I was sitting comfortably with a cup of tea rather than being a refugee, not in the Ukraine but in Poland or wherever. ""We are going through every step of trying to shorten that form."" Emma Haddad, director general for asylum and protection at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), said the length of the form for the sponsorship scheme had been cut by a third since applications for refugees first opened after the conflict with Russia started. Earlier in the session, MPs heard how some Ukrainian refugees have been ""presenting as homeless"", despite being part of the UK Government resettlement schemes. Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association (LGA), said it was an issue councils were ""all worried about"". He told the committee that 144 Ukrainian arrivals had declared themselves homeless to 57 councils. ""Forty-four of which were from the family scheme, 36 of which were from the sponsorship scheme and 64 were from unknown or other,"" Mr Jamieson added. ""We believe there is an element of people presenting as homeless because they are coming to Ireland and then, with the free movement, able to come to the UK, so that (is) maybe an element of the unknown."" DLUHC officials said they would be working with councils to understand the ""scale"" of the problem and that local authorities would be able to fund accommodation out of their individual refugee grants. More than four million people have fled Ukraine since the fighting started on February 24, according to the UN refugee agency.",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy
2325,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,19/3/2022,875 words,MAY BULMAN SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,Homes for Ukraine scheme flounders on day of launch,"Fears have been raised that there is no clear route for Ukrainian refugees to apply to come to Britain under its new sponsorship scheme. On the day that the scheme launched, charities said that the number of refugees who will be granted sanctuary in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme will be only a ""trickle"", despite the fact that more than 150,000 people in Britain have registered to host them, because of the confusion around how they can be ""matched"" with hosts. It is unclear what action the government is taking to communicate information about the scheme to refugees stranded in Europe. The Independent revealed earlier this week that Ukrainians in Poland hoping to seek refuge in the UK had ""no idea"" how to go about it. The government said that when it launches ""phase two"" of the scheme - it is not yet known when this will be - it will work more closely with charities to identify Ukrainians in need of protection in the UK. Ministers launched the Ukraine sponsorship scheme yesterday, with the webpage stating that Ukrainian nationals and their family members may apply to come to the UK if they have a ""named sponsor"". The scheme, announced on Monday by the secretary of state for levelling up,Michael Gove, will allow Ukrainians with no family links to come to the UK and be hosted by members of the public, who will be paid £350 per month for sharing their homes. The government is yet to release data on the number of refugees who have applied to the scheme, but lawyers and charities warn that the figure is likely to be moderately low due to the lack of information on how refugees can connect with suitable sponsors. Jenni Regan, chief executive at iMix, which represents refugee and asylum charities in the UK, said that while the sector ""welcomed"" the speed at which the scheme had been implemented, there were ""concerns about just how many people from Ukraine this is actually going to help at this stage"". ""Currently, hosts need to have the name and details of the person they wish to sponsor before they can even apply, and there is no clear way of linking up with people seeking sanctuary from Ukraine,"" she said. ""The government have made it clear that they are not in a position to support the matching process, instead relying on charities [as well as] faith and community groups to provide outreach and matching opportunities."" Announcing the scheme, Mr Gove saidhe hoped individuals and community groups would be able to ""match"" with refugees using social media, adding that charities would help with the process. But Ms Regan raised concerns about this, saying that it would only benefit those who are ""digitally savvy"", and adding: ""This method is also concerning in terms of safeguarding on both sides."" Robina Qureshi, executive officer at Positive Action in Housing, a charity that has been matching refugees and asylum seekers with hosts in the UK for decades, said it had so far been contacted by 16,000 people offering to host Ukrainians, and just 160 Ukrainian refugees. ""What the government has is a spreadsheet with names on it of people expressing an interest. That register is going to go nowhere. Only a trickle of people will ever see a Ukrainian refugee,"" she said. ""Heartbreakingly, the people whose lives depend on that visa and that hosting programme are struggling and waiting. For all the goodwill that there is in the UK, the people whose lives depend on this process are not in the country."" Immigration lawyer Simon Cox, who is supporting a number of Ukrainians with applications to come to the UK, said it was ""clear"" that the programme ""hadn't been thought through"". ""There's certainly a role for the voluntary sector in the matching process, but it does need to be supervised by the government to ensure that those matches take place and are safe,"" he said. ""[The scheme] may have seemed like a great idea in turning down the political heat, but it's actually a huge operation. The government wants to go out and say they're doing something so the public move on and think about something else."" The government has said it will be working closely with charities, faith groups, universities and others to ensure people who want to help are matched to people from Ukraine. It advises on its website that if someone wishing to host does not currently know a Ukrainian refugee, they ""may wish to get in touch with charities, faith groups or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals"". Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon announced yesterday that the country had opened its ""super-sponsor"" scheme, meaning Ukrainian refugees can apply via the UK sponsorship scheme by selecting ""Scottish government"" on the application.

Micheal Martin, speaking in Helsinki , admitted the Republic of Ireland will face challenges housing the refugees set to arrive into the country. Around 20,000 Ukrainian refugees have reached Ireland already after fleeing Russia's invasion of their home country. It comes as Tanaiste Leo Varadkar played down suggestions Ireland may expel the Russian ambassador after two Irish diplomats were asked to leave the Irish embassy in Moscow. The move came two weeks after four senior Russian officials were asked to leave Ireland because their activities had not been ""in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour"". Mr Martin, who is visiting Finland and Estonia, said he had a ""very good"" meeting with Finland's President Sauli Niinisto. ""We had a very broad discussion in terms of the international situation, particularly the war in Ukraine and the degree to which the multilateral order has been turned upside down, the sheer barbaric nature of attacks on Ukrainian civilians and the implications for the security architecture of Europe well into the future and the capacity of open economies to continue to do what we do best,"" Mr Martin said. ""All of that is under threat by the Russian attack so we had a very interesting discussion around those issues and how all has changed in terms of this Russia attack and these implications for the future."" Asked how close Ireland is to running out of accommodation for refugees, Mr Martin said: ""What is remarkable is that over 20,000 refugees have come into Ireland from Ukraine. We have never experienced such a rapid inflow of refugees fleeing war before. ""On the accommodation front, it is stretched but then there are lots of new initiatives coming on stream. It will be difficult in the coming weeks, of that there is no doubt. ""We are bringing more staff in, particularly on the pledging side, to get through that list faster and to release homes faster for refugees coming into the country."" He indicated the Government is looking at options ""through local authorities, through vacant properties and the reconfiguration of properties"". And he said housing minister Darragh O'Brien is working to ""fast-track decisions to get facilities on stream more quickly"". He said: ""We will fulfil our obligations as best we can in relation to that and we are in close solidarity with Ukraine. ""There is no doubt that there is a strategic approach behind the Russian bombardment of cities and towns and the intimidation and desire to create migration as a leverage. ""We have got to resist that and we are all part of a community within Europe and we have stand up against that type of naked aggression. It will be challenging for us. ""This war will have impacts on us all and our challenge is to put humanity first and do everything we can to protect the lives. ""We have strengths and resources as a country and they will be stretched."" Speaking in the Dublin suburb of Inchicore, Mr Varadkar said a response from Moscow to the decision to expel Russian diplomats was anticipated. While he rejected calls for an immediate ejection from Ireland of Yury Filatov, he said expelling the Russian representative had not been ruled out. ""I suppose the reason why we don't want to expel the Russian ambassador at this stage is that if we get to that point where we're expelling ambassadors, we could see an end to diplomatic relations between the two countries. That's very hard to put back on again. We do have citizens of Russia that we want to look out for. ""And also, ultimately, there will be peace talks. There will be a ceasefire. There will be some sort of foreign peace agreement. And I don't think it would make sense for us to cut off diplomatic relations in that context."" He said he would rather ""get to the point where we have a ceasefire and where we can start to talk about de-escalation of this conflict and coming to a solution"".",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,1,Policy

Stevenson and her husband have offered one of their adult children's bedrooms to a Ukrainian mother and her six-year-old daughter, who moved in last week. The Nationality and Borders Bill being debated in Commons is out of step with the generosity that more than 150,000 members of the public have shown in wishing to offer refuge to Ukrainian families forced to flee the conflict, she said. There's hundreds of thousands of people offering refuge in our own homes to Ukrainian refugees, and this Bill seeks to really criminalise the whole process of seeking asylum Juliet Stevenson She told the PA news agency: ""I think it is a Bill that entirely lacks compassion or justice and fairness, and I think it's not at all in step with what the British people are feeling at the moment. ""There's been this amazing outpouring of agonised concern about what people are going through in Ukraine, and people in this country have opened up their hearts and their homes, there's hundreds of thousands of people offering refuge in our own homes to Ukrainian refugees, and this Bill seeks to really criminalise the whole process of seeking asylum."" Stevenson, 65, is backing changes to the Bill called for by Together With Refugees, a coalition of almost 500 national and local charities across the UK. It wants the UK to commit to resettle at least 10,000 refugees from around the world every year, and to scrap a clause which would punish refugees who have not arrived in the country through official routes.

3233,urc_theindependent_raw4.docx,The Independent,24/2/2023,1201 words,Nadine White,"Forgotten and abandoned: the Black, international students caught up in Ukraine conflict","Thousands of African students who fled Ukraine have been “frozen out” of receiving aid for those driven out by Russian attacks , The Independent has been told.  Before the conflict, around 76,000 international students, mostly from Nigeria and Morocco , Ghana , Zimbabwe and India , were based there.  But after grappling with racism at Ukraine’s borders while trying to flee, a large number of students are displaced in countries, including Turkey, Italy, Kenya, Romania and Belgium, unsure of their next move. Many are unable to complete their studies, battling with the mental and emotional distress of having escaped Putin’s onslaught , some are facing poverty, while others have even taken their own lives, The Independent has learned. But while Ukrainian citizens are able to receive aid from the international community, their African counterparts have been left to fend for themselves or rely on grassroots organisations for support. Speaking to The Independent from her family home in Nigeria, student Eshi, 24, said: “There were other people living in Ukraine with Ukrainians and, regardless of the colour of our passports, the colour of our skin or hair; we’re all human beings. “We actually had our lives in that country; not everyone was students, some had businesses and family members.” Following the outbreak of war, international students were advised to “go home”, however, help wasn’t forthcoming from many governments. A great number believed returning to their birth countries without a degree wasn’t a viable option and instead sought refuge in neighbouring European countries in a bid to secure future study. A key reason why many migrated to Ukraine in the first place, was the affordable tuition fees, access to special loans, and the opportunity to make better lives for themselves. International students from Ukraine are not allowed to transfer to UK universities, so the UK is a no-go zone for many of the thousands of African students seeking to finish their studies there. The only exception is the University of Manchester, which is accepting students from Ukraine who aren’t nationals of the country. While facing the prospect of repeating two years of studies due to the war’s disruption, many students have been asked by their universities to pay inflated tuition costs, an additional fee to graduate and shell out large amounts of cash for manuscripts, which they cannot afford. Anyone who falls behind with fees faces being expelled. And some Ukraine universities are forcing international students to return and sit exams before they can be awarded their degrees, The Independent has learned. Defending its decision, the Ukrainian government cited the need for “academic integrity and quality control”. However, with many students facing financial hardship and difficulty with securing visas, returning to the besieged country is not a viable prospect. As the world acknowledges the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, many students feel their plight has largely been forgotten. An earlier investigation by The Independent revealed that non-white refugees fleeing Ukraine were being detained in EU immigration facilities without reason. No one has been held accountable for this. Following social media posts about racism at the borders, The Independent interviewed students who had experienced this amid a sea of speculation from critics that the online commentary about discrimination was “lies” and a “Russian disinformation campaign”. Eventually, the United Nations released a statement acknowledging that the accounts were true and pledging to take action as celebrities, including Beyonce, showed solidarity with the international students. This week, over 70 MPs and peers, including the former home secretary Priti Patel, signed an open letter calling on the government to act now to help thousands of white Ukrainian refugees who are facing homelessness in the UK. Commentators have pointed to a disparity in public and political concern about the welfare of Black students who fled Ukraine. Korrine Sky, 27, a second-year medical student who studied in Dnipro before fleeing the war, is now based in Leicester. The Zimbabwe-British dual citizen was devastated to learn that she could not transfer to continue studying in the UK as the General Medical Council (GMC) had stopped accepting medical qualifications from her school. She has not received any support from the UK government or agencies, as citizen, since arriving back a year ago. Reconciling with the trauma of escaping war, having a gun pointed at her head and being lunged at while facing discrimination at borders, the prospect of delaying her dream of becoming a doctor has been a lot to bear, she says. “At the time I felt that I experienced an identity crisis because a major part of my identity was that of a medical student,” she said. “I pursued my hopes of becoming a doctor but I (have since) felt that I had to let that dream go in order to fully heal (...). “I’m trying to remind myself that what happened, how the war affected me, was not my fault and I’m not less of a person,” the mother-of-two added between tears. Some international students who struggled with this plight have since taken their own lives, Ms Sky said. “It’s as if the racism that was experienced in Ukraine (at the borders) is now being reinforced in several other countries,” Ms Sky said.  “We’re being told again and again: ‘Ukrainians only’. empathy is not being extended to our community because it’s not our country, as we’ve been told numerous times. “That has left many of us struggling with our mental health, but also living in different European countries without having any support. “I empathise with a lot of my peers who have resulted in taking their own lives; I have felt that depression where you’re wondering what to do next.”  A 22-year-old student from Ukraine, who fled to Portugal after the war, told The Independent that distance learning classes were not good enough and teaching support has been lacking. The student, who has dealt with flashbacks and nightmares since leaving Ukraine, said: “To the world, it might seem like this one year -but to me, it doesn’t seem like so much time has passed. “I’m out of the war zone but it still feels fresh in my memory. I’m glad that people have moved on, but the problems that Ukraine (universities) keeps bringing up, it’s not easy for some of us to move on.” The group Africans in Ukraine Education Fund (AIUEF), established by Ms Sky, is raising money for students to continue their studies and has called on global agencies and organisations to “provide fair treatment” to all students. An online petition calling on universities in the EU, Britain, and the US to put in place support packages and scholarships for African students forced to leave Ukraine has garnered almost 35,000 signatures. “We are asking that African students be offered access to university places on the same terms as their Ukrainian counterparts. Everyone should have a right to education and this should not be a right that is given to some and not others.”  The Independent has approached the United Nations, Ukraine’s government and the UK government for comment.",Broadsheet,0,2023-02,1,Aid

2299,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,14/3/2022,837 words,LIZZIE DEARDEN HOME AFFAIRS EDITOR,Majority of the public back those seeking refuge in UK,"Three in four Britons back giving refuge to those fleeing war or persecution, new polling shows, as criticism of the government's response to the Ukraine crisis continues. An Ipsos survey found that even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a majority of Britons thought people should be able to seek refuge in the UK, and the majority had sympathy for asylum seekers crossing the Channel. Yesterday, charities and opposition parties voiced fears that the government's new sponsorship route - which will give Britons who provide homes to Ukrainianrefugees £350 per month - would be ""slow and cumbersome"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove said he hoped ""tens of thousands"" would be able to come via the route, and announced that local authority areas will be entitled to more than £10,000 per Ukrainian refugee in their area. But the Refugee Council said ministers were still putting too many ""bureaucratic hurdles"" in the way of those fleeing Russian forces and said the complex scheme ""will inevitably be restricted to those who are known to people in the UK"". In response to criticism over support for Ukrainians, the government has created a bespoke ""family scheme"" that offers three-year visas but does not amount to a grant of asylum. Experts said the government had ""misread the public mood"", as the war sparks wider questions over the UK's asylum system. A wide-ranging survey by Ipsos and the British Future think tank, which was carried out weeks before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, showed that attitudes towards immigration and asylum have warmed significantly since the 2016 EU referendum. Only 16 per cent of Brits disagreed that people ""should be able to take refuge in other countries, including in Britain, to escape from war or persecution"". Less than a third of people agreed with the statement that ""it is important to have an asylum system that deters people from seeking asylum in the UK"" while 46 per cent would rather have a fair asylum system ""even if that means allowing more asylum seekers to stay and live in the UK than we do now"". When asked about small boat crossings in the English Channel, 56 per cent of those surveyed said they had sympathy for people making the journeys, while 39 per cent said they had little or no sympathy. Mr Gove said he expects the first Ukrainian refugees making use of the government's new sponsorship route to come to the UK ""in a week's time"". The levelling up minister said he hoped individuals and community groups would use social media to connect with refugees, adding that charities would help in the ""matching"" process. Labour cautioned that ""too many questions remain unanswered"" about the new scheme. ""We're asking people to take to social media at a time they're fleeing a war zone. This is a serious crisis - it's not an online dating situation,"" shadow levelling up minister Lisa Nandy told LBC. Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, said: ""The government clearly misread the public mood about Ukrainian refugees and is now playing catch-up to make the generous offer of sanctuary that people feel is right ... underlying attitudes to immigration are becoming more positive over time."" The survey showed that the number of British people wanting general immigration reduced was at its lowest level for seven years, while a greater proportion of people said it has had a positive effect on Britain. The research involved interviewing 3,206 British adults online between 28 January and 10 February 2022, with findings weighted to reflect the population profile. Gideon Skinner, the research director at Ipsos, said: ""We know that Britons are supportive of making it easier for Ukrainian refugees to come to the UK, but this research shows this is part of a long-term belief in the principle of giving refuge to people fleeing war and persecution."" The next stage of the research, which will be published in six months' time, will show what impact the Ukraine war has had on attitudes. Polling also showed that less than a third of British people want to deter asylum seekers, as controversial new laws are to be debated in parliament. A bill being considered by the House of Lords today seeks to criminalise all refugees arriving in Britain ""without permission"" and see them deported abroad, or possibly held in offshore processing centres. The Nationality and Borders Bill has been hailed by the government as the ""cornerstone"" of its immigration plans, and names one of its key priorities as ""deterring illegal entry into the UK"". The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015.

The charity Hope and Aid Direct was set up in the 1990s in response to the Balkans conflict but nothing has prepared them for the outpouring of help, both needed and offered, it has received since the war broke out in the Ukraine. Trustee Roger Wilson has travelled to Eastern Europe to help with the aid operation as more than a million refugees have fled Ukraine and travelled into neighbouring countries. Our phones, inboxes, WhatsApp groups and all other forms of communications have gone totally mad Charity trustee Roger Wilson Mr Wilson said the charity was focusing its aid efforts on Romania , Slovakia , and Moldova. ""Our phones, inboxes, WhatsApp groups and all other forms of communications have gone totally mad,"" he said. ""But the transportation of aid is complex, you can't just load a van and go."" He said that to send aid to help Ukrainian refugees the charity had to be sponsored by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the country receiving the aid. They, in turn, need to have the correct warehousing and facilities to receive the aid and move it on to those that need it most. Mr Wilson, from Sussex, said he travelled to the region to monitor the situation and understand where their support could best be utilised. ""In Poland, there is a sense of organised chaos,"" he said. ""People are arriving, food, medical supplies and the right type of aid is available - and there are systems in place for the onward journeys to major cities in the country. ""Unfortunately, the story is not the same for other border countries, such as Romania, Slovakia and Moldova."" In Slovakia, while the borders are very similar, people are arriving mostly on foot, he said. It is busier than the Polish border with many smaller volunteer organisations on the ground and less coordination. ""It felt different and less hospitable,"" Mr Wilson said. ""Amongst the many with a genuine desire to provide support, there are some offering 'help' in exchange for, I am not sure for what, but you certainly get the feeling that the bowl of soup is far from free."" Mr Wilson said the Essex-based charity had good contacts with several NGOs across Slovakia, Romania and Moldova. ""I travelled to the region to meet up with some long term contacts we have in the region,"" he said. ""I am confident that we now have reliable NGOs that we can work with in Romania immediately and Moldova and Slovakia for future trips. We are ready to go.""

1840,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,11/7/2022,628 words,LIZZIE DEARDEN,UK support for Ukrainian refugees already waning,"Public support for Ukrainian refugees is already waning in Britain, polling suggests, as the war continues to rage. Polling by YouGov shows that in March, three-quarters of people supported resettling Ukrainians in the UK and 42 per cent thought the figure should be in the tens of thousands ""at least"". But the figures have now dropped to 71 per cent of people supporting resettlement, with 29 per cent wanting to see tens of thousands of refugees welcomed. There is no resettlement scheme for Ukrainian refugees, with the government instead offering three-year visas - that do not amount to a grant of asylum - to people who have relatives in the UK or are sponsored by volunteers. So far, there have been 175,100 applications to the scheme, 148,300 of which have been granted, and 91,000 Ukraine visa holders have arrived in the UK. Ministers set up a bespoke Afghan resettlement process following the Taliban takeover last year, but YouGov's polling shows that only half the public support it. The scheme, which started in January, has been applied to some of the 15,000 people who were already in the UK after being evacuated from Afghanistan. Although the figures have fallen, the research indicates that British people are more supportive of Ukrainian refugees than those from other nations. YouGov said its research suggested that the ""British public feel less generous and more morally conflicted about refugees from Afghanistan, Syria and Somalia, compared to Ukraine, with Conservative voters particularly likely to take a harder stance on refugees from these countries"". When asked the same question for each nationality, 71 per cent of people said they would support resettling Ukrainian refugees, half said they would support resettling Afghan refugees, 48 per cent said they would support resettling Syrians and 40 per cent would support the same for Somalian refugees. The figures are particularly stark for Conservative voters. While almost three-quarters welcomed Ukrainian refugees, only 37 per cent said the same for Afghans, under a third for Syrians and a fifth for Somalis. Tory supporters were also more likely to see Afghan, Syrian and Somali refugees as ""a threat"" than Labour supporters or the public at large, although just 5 per cent thought the same for Ukrainians. Conservatives were also less likely to believe the UK has a ""moral obligation"" to offer asylum. The Reset Communities and Refugees charity said it was still receiving a ""high level of interest"" from people offering to accommodate Ukrainians in their homes. But chief executive Kate Brown added: ""We know levels of interest change according to the news agenda and cost of living pressures, and that compassion fatigue can also set in. ""Even so, we are continuing to see high levels of interest from people in hosting Ukrainian people in their own homes, having trained more than 3,000 sponsors under our Homes for Ukraine matching service. At the same time, we have had record numbers of applications from volunteer community sponsorship groups coming together to welcome refugees from a range of countries."" Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: ""The only thing that should matter in our refugee protection policy is a person's need for protection. There is no wrong type of refugee. ""We believe that the public has huge compassion for those seeking safety. However, it is the government that has sought to stoke up divisions by pitting one group of refugees against another, setting up bespoke resettlement schemes for some while creating an ugly deportation plan to Rwanda for others.

The International Tourism and Events student at Glasgow Caledonian University said: ""In war, it's always the innocent civilians that suffer. I feel as if I have to do something to help."" The student, who lives in the west end of Glasgow, has delivered more than 30 second-hand ambulances to war zones in Burma, Syria , Iraq, and Yemen.  His journey to Ukraine includes a ferry crossing from Newcastle to the Netherlands , where he will then drive through Germany and then to the border in Poland. Once in mainland Europe during the 1,500-mile trip, he plans to fill the vehicle with much-needed aid. ""One ambulance can only help a few hundred people but there are tens of thousands in need,"" the third-year student said. ""It is heart-breaking to see what is happening over there. The ambulance can be used to transport disabled people, older people, or can be filled up with medical supplies."" Once in Ukraine it is hoped the ambulance will be used within the war-torn country to distribute supplies and transport civilians out of immediate danger. ""I have travelled a lot and I've seen the impact war has on civilians first-hand,"" he said. ""At times of crisis, these areas need supplies and they need patient transport.""

2514,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,30/3/2022,802 words,Via AP news wire,Ukrainians stranded in Hawaii get help from canoe paddlers," A Ukrainian family who came to Hawaii for a long-awaited vacation ended up watching from the islands in shock as bombs started dropping on their country. Now, more than a month later, they remain stranded on Oahu without access to their house, money, family or friends. They've found support through the local canoe paddling community, which set them up with a place to stay and raised money online to help get them settled. They do not know if they will ever be able return to their home. Vasyl and Marina Prishchak and their three daughters, ages 5, 10 and 16, arrived in Hawaii in the middle of February and had an idyllic, three-week beach vacation planned before Russia invaded Ukraine.  ""This vacation changed our life,"" said Vasyl Prishchak, who along with his wife owns a cosmetics company with stores in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. ""We don't know how we return to Ukraine and what we will do, we will begin from zero, from scratch."" They are unsure if their house near a military base in Kyiv is still standing and say they are financially imperiled because their family business has been forced to close.  The family had been to Hawaii several times before to visit with longtime friends Borys and Beata Markin. Vasyl and Borys have been friends for about 30 years and are both avid ocean paddlers.  The community has helped the family with everything from schooling and immigration questions to financial help and a place to stay. Until last week they were staying at a loaned home in Kailua, a beach town on the windward side of Oahu, but family friend Beata Markin said they've now secured a small cottage in Kaneohe where the owner is allowing them to stay free of charge for as long as they need.  ""They have nowhere to go,"" said Markin, who was born in Hungary and has lived with her Ukrainian husband in Hawaii for eight years. ""I think it's our responsibility to make sure they are OK here.""  An online fundraiser organized by canoe club members has so far raised more than $32,000 for the family. ""Sadly, we can't help all the Ukrainians, but we can help this family,"" wrote Charlotte Johnson, an Oahu resident who helped set up the fundraiser. ""The banking system in Ukraine is a shambles, and they cannot access any of their accounts. None of us can even imagine going on a vacation only to find the life left no longer exists."" Globally, tens of thousands of Ukrainians were overseas when Russia invaded. In addition, the United Nations says more than 3.8 million people have fled Ukraine since the war began, the biggest movement of people in Europe since World War II. While U.S. officials could not immediately say exactly how many Ukrainians were in the U.S. on tourism or business visas when the war began, the Department of Homeland Security expects an estimated 75,000 Ukrainians to be eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status, which will allow them to stay in the country for 18 months.  Though the Prishchak family hopes to eventually return home, they are applying to stay under the program, which was created in 1990 to allow people to remain in the U.S. because of civil strife or natural disasters in their home countries. Permission is extended until Homeland Security deems conditions are stable enough for people to return. The U.S. is also expanding efforts to help Ukrainian refugees elsewhere. While in Brussels to meet with European allies last week, President Joe Biden said the U.S. would admit up to 100,000 more Ukrainian refugees and provide $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to countries affected by Russia's invasion. Prishchak's oldest daughter, 16-year-old Mariia, said her excitement about vacationing in Hawaii was quickly replaced by fear for loved ones.  In the first week, they took a lot of photos, she said, but ""one day we disappeared from all social media because it is no time to post these photos when people suffer."" Mariia said she had always dreamed about going to school in the U.S., but not under such terrible circumstances. She checks in with friends and family every morning and night to make sure they are safe.  ""Every day, I hope that next day everything will be finished,"" she said. ""And it's awful. I'm confused and I can't do anything else except for thinking about the situation."" Her father said it's difficult being in the safety of a tropical paradise while other men his age are back home fighting and not allowed to leave the country.  ""It's a really terrible feeling that eats away at you from inside when you understand that all your close relatives are now in a very complicated situation,"" the elder Prishchak said in Russian. ""And there's no way you can help them stop this absolute insanity. It's a feeling that simply eats you up inside, you could say. A horrible sensation, an inner guilt that I'm here and not there.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Aid

But what is it like sharing your home with someone who has fled war? Rachel and Nigel Poulton have been welcoming refugees into their North Yorkshire home for five and a half years, and are hoping to house a Ukrainian family soon.  Rachel's advice to anyone considering taking a refugee into their home is simple: ""A warm welcome goes a long way.""  She continues: ""We just try and give them a warm, calm welcome. We don't ask questions and I always tell them that I'm glad that they are here."" The Poultons are already housing a number of unaccompanied child refugees at the moment, but have a spare room that they are hoping to offer to a Ukrainian family.  Ms Poulton said: ""We have a large family room that we built onto the side of our house, originally to look after ageing parents. It's got an en suite, and space for children and a cot, and we're hoping to use it soon."" They have signed up to welcome a Ukrainian family through the charity Sanctuary Foundation, and through the government scheme.  ""I feel like I'm learning the whole time,"" said Ms Poulton, ""and I'm sure we do make mistakes. But people shouldn't feel like they need all the answers. If there is compassion that comes from the heart, people can sense that. If you are genuine it shows."" Rachel Poulton and her husband, who works as CEO of a children's charity, have taken in unaccompanied child refugees from Eritrea, Syria, Afghanistan and a number of other countries over the past few years.  They work with the local council and social workers to make sure that their new lodgers get settled into the community before they move on. ""I always tell them that I want them to feel safe,"" Ms Poulton said. ""If it was one of our kids in their situation - in a foreign country, with no money, who couldn't speak the language, and who had gone through desperately hard circumstances - I would want someone to open their doors and be kind to them."" She often writes a welcome card for her guests when they arrive. ""Those little things can mean more than we realise,"" Ms Poulton said.  ""There was one time when a young man was moving on, having been with us for a couple of years. He was quite a tough, cool guy, and I was helping him pack, and he put the little card in.  ""I was so surprised he still had it. He said that it had been really important to him when he first came, so he had kept it."" The best bit about sheltering refugees is being there when good things happen in their lives, she said.  ""Last night we went out to celebrate the birthday of one of the refugees who used to live here, and it was such a joyful evening,"" Rachel added. ""It's also a joy to see people learn to drive, achieve at school, and learn new skills like the piano and swimming."" Her two young children, who are still at home, have also learnt to get along well with their new housemates.  But as well as the positives, the people Rachel and Nigel take in have experienced a lot of trauma before they stay with them. ""They have dealt with so much on their journeys to the UK, in the countries that they come from, and also in the ongoing news they see through their mobiles.  ""This will be true of Ukrainians too. They will experience ongoing trauma when they look at the footage and keep up with the bad news."" She is worried that many Ukrainians fleeing the war will see Britain as too difficult to get to, too slow at processing documentation, and too far away.  She also has concerns about how they will be transported from Ukraine or the Polish border to the homes in Britain that are keen to accept them.  Levelling up secretary Michael Gove told MPs that Ukrainians with no family links would be allowed to come to the UK under the new scheme, and that there would be ""no limit"" to the number who can benefit.  They will have to have a ""sponsor"" in the UK who is willing to provide them with a home for a minimum of 6 months.  ""If you don't know anyone who you wish to sponsor, you may wish to get in touch with charities, faith groups, or local community organisations who are starting to make connections between individuals,"" the government guidance said.  Some 1.4 million children have now fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, meaning nearly one child a second has become a refugee, the UN said on Tuesday.

The scheme is a ""smokescreen"" and distraction from what really needs to happen, which is remove the visa requirement for Ukrainians like other European countries have done, said Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing. More than 122,000 Britons have registered their interest in taking in Ukrainians, and those who have found someone to sponsor will be able to apply from Friday. The scheme aims to match refugees with individuals, charities and other organisations who can provide accommodation for at least six months, enabling Ukrainians without family ties in the UK to enter the country. But Ms Qureshi said the Government had put NGOs in an ""invidious"" position and foistered the scheme on them without prior consultation. She only expects a ""trickle"" of refugees to arrive through the scheme because they will have to find people to become sponsors while abroad before they can apply, and then make their own way to the UK. She said it could take ""months and months of processing"" to safely match people to appropriate homes. She told the PA news agency: ""The people that need to come here, their life depends on being able to get into this country using the current route, and that's what's worrying us more than more than anything. ""Are some of the people going to be alive by the time the process has been gone through? ""They should be letting people in now, but the Government is doing to refugees what they've done to the Syrians and to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, and what they're doing is to reduce to an absolute minimum the number of refugees making their way to the UK in the midst of the worst refugee crisis since World War Two."" Positive Action in Housing runs Room for Refugees, the UK's longest running refugee hosting programme which has been in place since 2002. Ms Qureshi said the charity is receiving around 40 calls and up to 150 emails an hour from Brits wanting to offer accommodation to Ukrainian refugees. Almost 70 Ukrainian refugee families have registered with the charity, including 60 children and several heavily pregnant women currently in Ukraine, France, Poland, Belgium and Germany. The team will be working through the night to match them with vetted people who have registered as potential sponsors, and to support them while they apply for visas from Friday. Ms Qureshi also questioned how many people who have expressed an interest via the Government's website will have to withdraw because they later realise they do not have ""the physical or mental room"". She said: ""We do not have half a hosting program in place. ""All they've got is expressions of interest - they have not identified individuals to match them up.... this is an illusion of people helping because they're distracting from the fact that they haven't lifted visa restrictions."" It comes as the Government was urged to set up an emergency airlift for Ukrainian refugees on the Polish border. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK Government should provide free flights to the UK, as well as coaches to take people from border crossing points to the airport. Writing to Home Secretary Priti Patel and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, he also called for welcome centres to be opened for refugees arriving in Britain. The public has been praised for its ""hugely generous response"" after the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal reached £200 million - two weeks after launching. This equates to around £3 for every person in the UK, the DEC said. We are concerned the scheme could be too slow and complex to help some of the most vulnerable Andy Hewett, of the Refugee Council The Refugee Council said it has several concerns about the scheme, specifically around red tape, safeguarding and resourcing. Andy Hewett, head of advocacy, said it is concerned the scheme could be ""too slow and complex"" to help the most vulnerable, and said it favours those who already have a contact in the UK, who may not necessarily be the most at risk. James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said councils will need to be given as much data as possible on who a visa has been issued to, such as their age, medical and educational needs, family make-up, and more clarity on the safeguarding and accommodation checks they will need. He acknowledged councils will not be able to do everything they would like to do ""up front"" but said ""taking people from a very, very, very dangerous situation to a relatively safe space is something that we need to do as quickly as possible"". He told PA: ""I think this will be a two-stage process: there will be an initial check, let's get people away from the bombs as fast as possible, because clearly a bomb landing on your head is a very dangerous situation. ""And then once we've got them here, we've got a roof over their head and we've moved on from the immediate danger, then I think there will be a second or third process or a phase where we will go back, we will check what the situation's like with these people in this accommodation.""

""I thought you were just going to be able to turn up at the border on Tuesday -I even booked a Euro Tunnel crossing. ""But they are saying you need some form of approval from the Home Office."" Mr Billington was initially told to drive to Brussels where the family would ""get their visas in under 24 hours."" He pleaded with border control officers to let them through, but they threatened to have them forcefully removed by French police and said they would not be able to enter in the future. Mr Billington, from Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire said: ""The situation is, we're stuck in a hotel about 50 miles from Paris and it's costing me and my wife around 200 a day. ""It seems like Priti Patel made this announcement without checking with people on the ground who are saying no you can't do that. ""So we still need to go to the visa centre in Paris to hand over their passports and have their finger prints taken. ""We're probably going to be here for another week."" A government spokesperson said: ""Last week we announced a new sponsorship route which will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored to come to the UK. ""This is alongside our Ukraine Family Scheme, which has already seen thousands of people apply, as well as changes to visas so that people can stay in the UK safely. ""The routes we have put in place follow extensive engagement with Ukrainian partners. This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops, we will continue to keep our support under constant review.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,0,Conditions

The charity, which has been providing cash assistance, sim cards and signposting to Ukrainian refugees arriving in the UK following Russia’s invasion of the country, said payments should be given to members of the Ukraine Family Scheme in the same way that the Homes for Ukraine supporters receive cash. The Homes for Ukraine scheme, which sees Britons welcoming refugees into their homes, currently gives guests a £200 welcome payment and hosts £350 a month as a “thank you” payment for supporting the refugees. Councils also receive £10,500 under the scheme. However, under the Ukraine Family Scheme, where British-Ukrainian residents support their family who have left the nation since the invasion in February, these payments are not provided. Currently, the Government says hosts in the Homes for Ukraine scheme can receive the monthly payment of £350 for “up to 12 months, paid in arrears, for as long as you are hosting your guests and provided that the accommodation provided is of a suitable standard”. Richard Blewitt, executive director of the British Red Cross, said: “We’re encouraging the UK Government to step up its financial support given the scale of the economic crisis here in the UK and the cost-of-living crisis, particularly for the hosts. “With the Ukraine Family Scheme, which actually doesn’t involve any money from the Government, maybe the Government is going to have to chip in a bit to help those families also who are hosting many Ukrainians.” The charity has also raised concerns about the arrival of winter for Ukrainians who stayed in the country following the outbreak of the war and remain displaced six months on. Ukrainian refugees are eligible to apply for Universal Credit from day one and the PA news agency understands early payments can be made to prevent a five-week delay. Refugees in these schemes will also get an additional £200 payment while their claim is processed. A Government spokesman said: “Taken together, our generous Homes for Ukraine and Ukraine Family schemes are one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history, with over 175,000 visas issued and more expected to come through these uncapped routes. “We expect Ukrainians entering the UK through the Ukraine Family Scheme to be primarily supported by family members, but they are also entitled to three years’ leave to remain and full access to work, study and benefits – including Universal Credit. “Local authorities have a duty to provide support to people on the family scheme, including homelessness where required.” The Disasters Emergency Committee, which raises funds for 13 charities helping Ukrainians overseas including the Red Cross, meanwhile said on Tuesday its online campaign has now reached £380 million since it was first launched. The money raised goes towards giving medical support, food, water and cash to people inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries who have been left traumatised by the conflict. It also funds keeping vulnerable people, including women, children, older people and people with disabilities, safe. Saleh Saeed, chief executive of the Disasters Emergency Committee, said: “This incredible, generous support has meant that our member charities have been able to help hundreds of thousands of people affected by this complete conflict with vital aid. “It’s enabled us to mobilise a huge response through the work of our 13 member charities and their local partners inside Ukraine, including through partnerships with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and by empowering local people and local organisations.” Mr Saeed added that he believed British people would still continue to donate towards the fund to help Ukrainians get through the winter despite any financial concerns they may have as a result of the cost of living crisis. “I think what we’ve seen time and time again, during major humanitarian crises overseas, is that the British public has been very, very supportive,” he said. “We’ve seen in previous financial crises, whether that was in 2008 or elsewhere, that when it comes to humanitarian action, the UK public are very supportive and do recognise that despite our hardships here … people still want to reach into their pockets and give as generously as they can.” He added that those who are unable to afford to donate money find alternative ways to support the cause, such as organising fundraising events and activities. “It’s incredible, thank you to everyone that has contributed,” he added.",Broadsheet,0,2022-08,1,Policy

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also indicate that people who have come to Britain after fleeing Putin’s invasion have struggled to access healthcare.  The survey of 3,412 individuals on both the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme found that 37 per cent reported they have enough money to support themselves and their dependents for the next three months – indicating that nearly two-thirds do not. Around four in five (83 per cent) working-age respondents reported they were currently working, or that they were very likely or likely to look for work in the UK in the next month. The findings also show that a third of respondents were receiving regular healthcare treatment before leaving Ukraine, but only 22 per cent of them said this treatment had continued since arriving in the UK. Around one in five respondents (21 per cent) reported receiving regular prescriptions for medication or drugs while in Ukraine, but only 37 per cent said they have been able to access regular prescriptions and drugs since arriving in the UK. It comes after it emerged last month that 660 households who have come to Britain via these routes have been forced to register as homeless. The data, published by the Department for Levelling up, Communities and Housing, revealed that of the homeless households, 480 were families with at least one child, while 180 were single households. Government figures show 109,700 refugees have so far come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, while 45,900 have arrived under the family scheme. The ONS survey also revealed that around four in ten respondents (38 per cent) said they intend to stay in the UK for three years or more, while 29 per cent said they intended to stay for up to three years and 30 per cent did not know. It shows that the overwhelming majority who have arrived are women with children, and nearly half can speak or read English. A government spokesperson said: “From day one, Ukrainians have had the right to work and to access benefits and public services, including education and healthcare, on the same-footing as UK nationals. This will continue to be the case for those who wish to remain in the UK.â€‹” More than 5.8 million refugees from Ukraine have fled to European countries since the war started at the end of February, according to data from the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).",Broadsheet,0,2022-07,0,Migration

Some nine days after collecting the keys to the Montreal Arms in Brighton , Charlie Southall decided to offer it for use as a free co-living space for Ukrainian women and children who have fled the Russian invasion. The 43-year-old has lived in Brighton for the last 15 years but grew up in poverty and spent a summer living in a women's refuge in Stafford when he was 10-years-old after his parents' divorce. At the time, Mr Southall received help from the youth charity The Prince's Trust , founded by the Prince of Wales , which he said hugely influenced his decision to donate the building, as he knew the positive experience that charitable intervention could have. ""Although it sounds horrific, and of course there was an underlying crisis, I have got really positive memories from that experience because it felt like a fresh start,"" he told the PA news agency. ""I've got firsthand experience of how that co-living, peer support system can really help people that are in that situation ... now I'm able to do something to help others, and you know what, it's been one of the nicest things I've done in recent times. ""I was watching the news and like all of us, I've been quite moved by the humanitarian crisis ... it really had an effect on me. ""(Donating the pub) has woken me up and I'm enjoying it, it's giving me a pleasure that I've not experienced before and it's a fortunate position to be in."" The video production company owner has started a GoFundMe page to raise £85,000 to pay for the renovations needed to turn the former pub into a usable living space. The renovation plans include creating a kitchen, a living space and a play area for children, utilising the open-plan layout on the ground floor of the building. There are already six rooms on the upper floor which will be used as bedrooms. Mr Southall said he would offer the pub for a minimum of three years, to match the Government Homes for Ukraine refugee scheme which promises a three-year visa for refugees fleeing the war. His campaign also aims to raise donations from local businesses and he would like local residents to contribute and participate in the building works. He has been in talks with various charities to help with the property once it is up and running as a community space, including how to help with language barriers and mental health rehabilitation. Mr Southall said he had been moved by the support of the local community in Brighton, and that people had offered kitchen appliances and vans to help move supplies. One woman, who owns a local pottery cafe, offered tiles with which Ukrainian children could paint and decorate their rooms.

Kevin Foster , the minister for immigration and future borders, has declined an invitation from the Home Affairs Committee to answer questions on what Britain is doing to provide support and refuge to people leaving Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. The committee said that ""given the urgency of the situation"" it had asked the minister to reconsider.  A Home Office spokesperson later told The Independent Mr Foster ""has not refused to attend but asked for a later date given this urgent work"" responding to the Ukraine situation. The department has come under criticism in recent days over its ""bespoke humanitarian route"" for Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, after it emerged that the scheme excludes swathes of refugees with loved ones in the UK. Home secretary Priti Patel announced on Tuesday that it was expanding the route to include parents, grandparents, adult children and siblings of British nationals and people settled in the UK, and that a new sponsorship scheme was being established to help people fleeing the Russia invasion. But many relatives, including partners or cousins of British nationals, as well as close relatives of people in the UK on work or study visas, who are not deemed to be ""settled"", remain excluded from the scheme. Shadow immigration minister Yvette Cooper said earlier this week that there remained ""significant questions"" about ""gaps in the system and delays"", and that she remained concerned about whether this would deliver the ""much needed support and sanctuary in practice"". It also emerged on Wednesday that the helpline set up by the Home Office for Ukrainian refugees wishing to join loved ones in Britain under the new visa scheme was being manned by advisers who know nothing about the scheme. It comes after Mr Foster was criticised for suggesting that Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion could apply for the seasonal worker scheme in order to get into the UK. Replying to a tweet by Labour's shadow armed forces minister Luke Pollard raising concerns that Ukrainians fleeing the conflict still have to apply for a visa to enter the UK last week, the immigration minister, in a now-deleted tweet, cited the seasonal worker scheme. The suggestion prompted calls for him to apologies - which he has not done. More than 1 million Ukrainians have already crossed the border, and the EU has said that 7 million people are likely to be displaced as a result of the conflict. Labour has today called on the government to end ""ongoing confusion"" over its policy on refugees fleeing President Putin's war by making a ""simple emergency visa"" available to all Ukrainians that need sanctuary and protection in the UK. Despite the commitments made by the prime minister to join other countries in providing protection for those who have fled the Russian bombardment in Ukraine, the opposition party warned that the ""rhetoric does not match the reality"". Ms Cooper said: ""People need a simple and safe route to sanctuary right now. Most want to stay close to home, especially those who have had to leave relatives behind, but the UK must play its part to help people seeking support and safety in our country too. ""Despite government announcements, desperate families are finding that the rhetoric doesn't match the reality. They cannot wait for the Home Secretary's slow and piecemeal approach which just doesn't match the urgency of this crisis. Ukrainians need help right now to reach safety.""

Almost two months have passed since the war in Ukraine began, killing thousands and creating millions of refugees. Disturbing images of suspected war crimes have been shared around the world, and inevitably the conflict has an impact on children growing up in an age of renewed nuclear fear. Volodymyr Muzyczka, a board member of the UK-based Association of Ukrainians, was looking forward to visiting Ukraine at Easter with his family, having missed out on seeing relatives back home for the three years due to the pandemic. But instead of playing with his cousins in his father's homeland, his seven-year-old son is ""continually worried"" about the war. ""When everything kicked off we tried to keep [information] from him as much as possible, we wouldn't listen to the news, we turned the radio down,"" says Mr Muzyczka. After hearing people talk about the war at school, his son came home very upset, worried the Russian army would come to kill him, ""because I'm Ukrainian and I've been to Ukraine"". ""It takes you down a blind alley,"" the 60-year-old says, as he speaks about how difficult it is to have such conversations with a child. His son also asked him what a nuclear bomb was one night as he was falling asleep, having heard friends at school talk about it. Fears of a full-blown nuclear war were triggered after Vladimir Putin put his nuclear deterrent forces on high alert in the first few weeks of war. ""There are some kids whose TV is on at home and the kids have taken it in via osmosis, and then sometimes kids are nasty and may bring it up in a way that is hurtful. He's had a few incidents like that."" Olena Davie, 44, a British Ukrainian mother of two teenage girls, says her daughters have also experienced upsetting encounters with their classmates about the conflict. When the war broke out in February, Ms Davie says her girls were ""heartbroken, of course"". ""They were crying a lot and supporting me,"" she says. ""Their cousin had to cross the border with just her dog and a little suitcase - she's just 15."" Considering the difficult news they were confronted with, they have been saddened by the lack of awareness from local children. ""They came home from school and were quite upset cause other kids were just laughing and making jokes about it,"" Ms Davie says as she reveals her youngest daughter, aged 13, felt the need to defend Ukraine to her class. ""Some of her classmates were laughing at bombs falling in Ukraine, she was quite emotional. ""She stood up in the class and said, 'How dare you? You don't know what's happening, you don't know the fears'. I was very proud of my daughter for standing up for what she believes in. She's one of those kids who doesn't normally speak up, she is very quiet."" The 44-year-old comforted her daughters by telling them their classmates were not mature enough to understand the situation. Teachers navigate the conflict Adam Gill, assistant principal of Penistone Grammar School in Barnsley, says his students seem more prepared to understand the Ukraine war because ""they're used to two or three years of bleak news and massive societal changes"". However, he is still faced with many questions such as: ""Is it going to continue or are we going to be expected to fight? Is conscription going to happen again?"" As a history teacher, he says he has seen his students making connections between the rise of Hitler and Putin's invasion. ""The students made the link of how it started with one area and then expanded without us having to point it out."" Sean Connolly, 32, is a primary school teacher at Eastbury Community School in east London. He describes comforting a six-year-old girl in his Year Two class after her mother told him she was very upset seeing the news. ""Her main fear seemed to come from, 'Will it happen to us, why is it happening, why aren't we fighting as well with them?'"" he says. ""She accepted that it's not going to come here and it won't affect her day-to-day life,"" he adds, ""but not the deeper reasons of why it's happening. When we were younger, when we [Britain] were involved actively in the military, the news that came from it seemed like we had to do it for our own safety. ""But the narrative is so different now, people who are being invaded are seen as victims, but we're not getting involved in the military. It's tough for them to get their head around."" Gurpreet Gill is the head of geography at the same school. She says a Polish student in her GCSE class expressed concern for what may happen if her country is dragged into the conflict, worrying that her family will have to go back there. As well as reassuring her student, the geography teacher says it is important to ""focus on raising awareness and listening to key facts rather than fake news"", adding that she reminds her pupils to be wary of polarising narratives that have come out of the war. She told her students: ""Don't go round and say to any of the Russian students that this is your fault. Their lives are also being ripped apart."" She also notes there are more observations on the difference in treatment between Ukrainian refugees and other war-torn countries among older students. ""They immediately picked up on the fact that Europe has been a lot more warming and welcoming to Ukrainian refugees compared to Syria,"" Ms Gill says, with one student branding the different response as Islamophobic. Others have asked if Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war would end up in the Channel, like in images they had seen before of young Syrian children found swept ashore. Ms Gill says the school ""does not shy away from these topics"" and has tried to have ""open and frank conversations"" with students, ensuring they are ""as unbiased as possible"". ""Students see a lot of these things and they don't quite understand so it's for us to navigate that for them,"" she adds. Adam Gill, from Penistone Grammar School, works for Minds Ahead, a social enterprise that supports the mental health needs of schools. He gave the following advice to parents and teachers when speaking about the conflict to children: ""It is important that we educate ourselves so we are in the position to have those answers and relieve those anxieties. ""Social media can be an echo chamber, so engage with the wider news. Bring them back to the here and now. If they have a panic attack, re-regulate them through their breathing, focus on what they can see, hear and touch.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,1,Migration
2129,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,7/3/2022,830 words,Judith Escribano,Voices: Why giving cash is better than alternatives to help Ukrainian refugees,"The Ukrainian conflict and accompanying humanitarian crisis have prompted a massive outpouring of support all around the world. Some are offering up their homes to host refugees, while others are organising collections of goods to send to people in Ukraine or neighbouring countries.  These are very generous solutions, but I'd like to explain why donating cash to charities is better; and why some charities will then pass on those cash donations as cash, rather than buying goods. We understand why people like to donate goods in an emergency, but we can't send food, clothes, blankets or medical equipment from the UK even if they're in perfect condition. Customs regulations and transport costs make the process of exporting items very complicated, time-consuming and expensive. The expense is usually more than the goods are worth. We also don't have the capacity to sort the goods here or to distribute them once there. It's usually much easier to buy items in the countries where they are needed. It's also usually cheaper and helps local markets and economies, helping countries to get back on their feet.  Think of the carbon footprint of driving goods 1,500 miles, when they could just as easily be bought in a shop in Poland, Moldova or Romania.  So, this explains why donating cash is better than donating goods. But what will we do with your donations once we have them? Well, sometimes, we won't even buy goods in-country or in neighbouring countries. Sometimes we will just give cash to people in need of help. Imagine fleeing your home under heavy bombardment. If you're lucky, there will be a break in shelling, and you'll have a car. You will pack it up with as much as you can and you will cross the border into a safe, neighbouring country. If you're not so lucky, you'll have travelled by foot, carrying with you as much as you can in a small case. Either way, you won't have much with you. You'll be leaving so much behind. When you reach the safety of a neighbouring country, you'll be exhausted and in despair. You'll be desperate to maintain contact with your friends and family back home or in other neighbouring countries. But you'll no longer be earning money. You may not be able to access your savings from the bank. You may not have any savings. You'll need food and drink and warmth; you may need credit for your phone so you can keep in touch with your loved ones. So, it is highly likely that you will need and want cash.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices newsletter by clicking here Charities can hand over cash to people in need of help so they can make choices on how best to spend the money. It's a dignified way of giving people support. It lets people know we trust them. It gives people freedom and power when they have none. And it helps local economies. In most situations, there is strong evidence that money - not goods - is the most efficient and effective way to distribute emergency aid. Giving cash transfers is not wasteful, does not create dependency and is empowering and effective. There are some concerns that cash could be diverted, but there are ways to prevent waste, in particular by paying directly to beneficiaries and being very clear about who is getting what. Quality control is vital too. Some people have donated infant formula and, while that is well-intentioned, that can be dangerous. People on the move often do not have a clean reliable place to mix the formula or clean the feeding equipment. They might not be able to mix it with clean water. They might also not be able to dilute the artificial milk in the right way if the label is not in their language. When infant formula is donated during emergencies, we tend to see a direct correlation between these donations and babies falling sick - or even dying.  So please, give cash not goods. And please also welcome it when charities say they are setting up cash transfer programmes.   Donations can be made at www.dec.org.uk or by calling 0370 60 60 900.

2377,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,1/4/2022,710 words,May Bulman,Homes for Ukraine: Official 'matching service' launched to link hosts with refugees,"An official ""matching service"" has been launched with government support to link refugees with UK hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Around 200,000 people in the UK who registered their interest in hosting Ukrainian refugees through a government website after it launched two weeks ago will now be asked to sign up on a separate platform in order to be considered for a ""match"". The service will be managed by Reset Communities and Refugees, a charity leading UK community refugee sponsorship since 2018, which will receive government funding. The charity has been given an initial grant of £300,000 to help design the matching process. It will bring together sponsors and refugees and assess their eligibility and suitability for the scheme, as well as providing training and advice to the sponsors and community groups. Refugees minister Lord Harrington, who was appointed by Boris Johnson earlier this month to facilitate safe and speedy passage of vulnerable Ukrainian evacuees, said: ""I am delighted and grateful that Reset are working with us to bring more people safely to the UK.""  The Independent is also raising money for the people of Ukraine - if you would like to donate then please click here for our GoFundMe page.  The Homes for Ukraine scheme, which opened on 18 March, enables Ukrainians with no family links to come to the UK and live in homes offered by members of the public or charities and organisations. Individuals offering their homes are offered a monthly payment of £350 and local councils receive £10,500 per refugee in the first year. The scheme has attracted some criticism after minister for Levelling Up Michael Gove said he hoped individuals and community groups would be able to match with refugees using social media. Ukrainian refugees subsequently started to ""advertise"" themselves on social media in a bid to find hosts in the UK, with a swathe of unregulated Facebook pages being set up for this purpose, prompting concerns that the programme could expose vulnerable people to abuse. Prime minster Boris Johnson admitted this week that the scheme could place people at risk of abuse, and indicated that the National Crime Agency (NCA) may need to be involved to prevent this from happening. Reset said the new service would facilitate a ""rigorous"" matching system, with trained caseworkers and volunteers, led by safeguarding experts, assessing the sponsors' intent, suitability, and availability while checking that the accommodation they are offering is appropriate. The charity set up the matching website on 15 March, but will now begin the formal matching process. The website has so far seen more than 7,000 refugees register, along with more than 8,000 UK households offering places for more than 20,000 refugees. Sponsors will also need to complete an online mandatory training programme before the matching process begins. The matching team will also carry out assessments of refugees to understand their personal circumstances and if they have particular ties to a place. Once the match has been made, the sponsors and refugees will need to submit a visa application to the Home Office, and local authorities will be responsible for the formal vetting process. Kate Brown, chief executive of Reset, described the launch of the matching service as ""an extraordinary moment for the refugee welcome movement in the UK"".

2036,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,14/6/2022,766 words,Sunny Hundal,Voices: Why are we treating Syrians so differently to Ukrainian refugees?,"Last month, 25-year-old Andriy Kovalenko just about managed to escape the city of Mariupol as Russians were advancing, and made his way to Poland. But the refugee camps were overflowing, so he made his way further west, towards Germany and eventually France. There, he made some friends and decided that, because he knew some broken English, he would make his way into Britain. He had heard good things about the country in the media and was hopeful he would be welcomed. But as he was making his way across the English Channel, in a boat full of other refugees, they were stopped. Now the government wants to deport him to Rwanda for processing. As one of the first deportation flights to Rwanda gets under way, he may be on it.  Surely, most right thinking people would be outraged by the prospect of us deporting a desperate and deserving asylum seeker such as Andriy to Rwanda? After all, his land is being bombarded and destroyed, and he just travelled across a continent for safety, only to find out he was being shipped off to a country run by a cruel dictator.  Now, imagine if we did the same to a Syrian refugee. Their country is in the exact same situation : being bombed by Vladimir Putin to help the dictator Bashar al-Assad maintain control. Entire towns have been blown into smithereens exactly like Mariupol. Millions of Syrians simply have nowhere to live. The neighbouring countries are already overflowing with refugees, so some have gone further away to find shelter. And yet, while Boris Johnson was adamant that no Ukrainian refugee would end up going to Rwanda, his home secretary is currently trying to deport Syrians to Rwanda. I made up the story of Andriy Kovalenko – there’s no such case as far as I know – to illustrate a point: while Syrians and Ukrainians are largely in the same situation, there is a huge difference in how our government is treating them. For one, British people are being actively encouraged to take Ukrainian refugees into their homes to house them in Britain –we’re even being paid to do so.  Some might argue that we have more obligation towards fellow Europeans than to those escaping conflict in the Middle East or further away like South Asia. I wouldn’t necessarily call that racist – I think it’s ok to say we have added obligation towards our neighbours. But the same argument was made against Jews escaping Nazi Germany (which is why we only allowed in the children ) and the same argument was made against Asians escaping persecution from Idi Amin in Uganda. And yet, German Jews and Ugandan Asians – along with people from Hong Kong and Vietnam and many other refugees from across the world – have made Britain their home and contributed immensely towards British life and prosperity. We should treat people according to their need, not their proximity. We should treat Syrians and Ukrainians equally – only that would be fair. If the scheme to deport refugees to Rwanda makes you uncomfortable, it should do. The cruelty is the point. Priti Patel and Johnson don’t care how much it costs, they think it sends a strong message and will act as a deterrent. But the same was said about Theresa May’s “hostile environment” policies and they didn’t deter anyone either. The British government’s starkly different approach towards Ukrainian and Syrian refugees should make us think twice. Do we want to be known for our generosity and fairness, or a country that doesn’t think twice about locking up refugees in a detention camp in a dictatorship?  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment, sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here I don’t believe the public supports this government’s cruelty. But they have been sold a lie that this is the only “tough decision” possible to stop trafficking and the channel deaths. That has already proven to be false.  If this government was intent on stopping trafficking, it would go after the traffickers, not the desperate refugees. If there are too many refugees being housed in hotels, it’s because the home office has been shown to be incapable of processing people quickly and letting them earn their own living. Instead they are left in limbo, forced to rely on the state when they would prefer to be self-sufficient. The Andriy Kovalenko I mentioned earlier may have been fictitious, but the story of his journey is shared by thousands of refugees. And it’s undoubtedly a story of refugees being treated differently because of their origin. That’s a story that should shame this government and its supporters.",Broadsheet,0,2022-06,1,Migration

Hours earlier the Home Secretary ruled out a visa waiver for those fleeing the conflict with Russia over security concerns. Speaking with ITV's Peston on Monday night, she reiterated statements made earlier in the day about the priority of safeguarding ""our public and our people"" from ""Putin's Russia"". She added that ""further changes"" would be announced in the ""next few days"" to help the people of Ukraine, but the current situation was ""very fluid and dynamic"". Ms Patel went on: ""This is absolutely a phased approach around humanitarian support for the people of Ukraine. So this isn't just about what we do on visas and our policy, this is much wider than that. ""So over the last weeks we've been focused on getting British nationals out of Ukraine, we've changed all sorts of things in terms of visas and prioritisation of cases. That's the first aspect to this. ""Our policies are evolving - this is changing, this is a very fluid and dynamic situation. And in fact there will be further changes and announcements that we'll be making in the next few days as well."" The Home Secretary, who has come under intense political pressure from MPs across the Commons to do more to allow Ukrainian refugees to reach the UK, insisted she was taking action to open safe routes. Ms Patel also faced criticism from refugee charities for falling short of the package of measures put forward by all 27 EU member countries. According to UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi 520,000 refugees from Ukraine have so far fled to neighbouring countries and the number keeps rising. The UN is planning for up to four million refugees in the coming weeks if the conflict doesn't end, he said. ""We know that we are not even scratching the surface to meet the needs of Ukrainians,"" he told an emergency Security Council meeting. Earlier on Monday Ms Patel told MPs in the Commons she was following the ""strongest security advice"" as she rejected the call to scrap the need for visas. ""Over the weekend I have seen members of this House calling for full visa waivers for all Ukrainians,"" Ms Patel said. ""Security and biometric checks are a fundamental part of our visa approval process worldwide and will continue, as they did for the evacuation of people from Afghanistan. ""That is vital to keep British citizens safe and to ensure that we are helping those in genuine need, particularly as Russian troops are now infiltrating Ukraine and merging into Ukrainian forces. ""Intelligence reports also state the presence of extremist groups and organisations who threaten the region but also our domestic homeland. ""We know all too well what Putin's Russia is willing to do, even on our soil, as we saw through the Salisbury attack."" The Home Secretary said the first phase of the ""bespoke humanitarian route"" being created for Ukrainians to enter the UK would allow around 100,000 people to come to ""seek sanctuary"".

It confirmed that the contract to use the MS Ambition, which is currently docked near Glasgow , would come to an end on March 31 this year. Neil Gray, the minister with special responsibility for refugees from Ukraine, said use of the vessel – currently home to about 1,170 Ukrainians, including 420 children – was always intended to be a temporary measure. He added that the Scottish Government would now look to make “full use” of both existing and new volunteer hosts to provide somewhere to stay for the refugees. The announcement that its use is being ended comes after ministers last month extended the contract for another ship being used to house refugees, the MS Victoria which is docked outside Edinburgh , for a further five months. Mr Gray said: “The MS Ambition was a temporary measure to ensure Scotland could respond to the humanitarian crisis facing people in Ukraine and provide an immediate place of safety for displaced people. “Our focus now is to secure sustainable longer term accommodation for the Ukrainians currently on MS Ambition and in other welcome accommodation to ensure they have the support they need to build a home in Scotland for as long as they need it. “This includes making full use of existing and new volunteer hosts.

In a speech to yesterday service at a Ukrainian cathedral in London, the prime minister said that the UK ""cannot shut our eyes"" to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which he said resulted in ""the darkest times in modern memory"" for Ukrainians. At the Ukrainian Cathedral of the Holy Family, in Mayfair, Mr Johnson said the UK has a system that grants people permission to enter for the longer-term when they are in fear of persecution, to reunite with family or ""other purposes"". But this means that, under current rules, Ukrainian refugees fleeing the invasion who do not have immediate family connections to the UK will be denied entry. The European Union has agreed to host Ukrainian refugees for three years without asking them to apply for asylum, and regardless of whether they have a family connection in any of the 27 member states. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, foreign secretary Liz Truss said the UK was ""urgently looking"" at what the government can do to ""facilitate"" the arrival of people fleeing war. About 370,000 people have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin commanded the invasion, the United Nations estimates. Mr Johnson confirmed that, in response to the worry of Ukrainians in the UK about their families in Ukraine, any person settled in the UK will be able to bring their Ukrainian immediate family members to join them. His comments came afterThe Independentlaunched itsRefugees Welcomecampaign, calling on the government to set up a resettlement scheme to grant sanctuary in the UK to Ukrainians fleeing thebloody conflict. The prime minister's announcement was welcomed by the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper. But she said it ""should have happened days ago as too many desperate family members have been struggling and delays have been deeply damaging"". She added: ""We hope this announcement includes wider family as well as just the closest relatives - and it is vital that we see those details as soon as possible. ""Now, the government should also work with European countries on a wider sanctuary arrangement so the UK can also do its bit alongside others to help Ukraine."" Scotland's first minister called on the UK government to scrap visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens fleeing the conflict with immediate effect. In a tweet yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon said the Home Office must give entry now on humanitarian grounds ""to any Ukrainian seeking refuge in the UK"", and to ""sort paperwork later"". She described the UK immigration system as ""inhumane"" and ""indefensible"". In his cathedral speech, Mr Johnson also announced that the government will make £40m more available in humanitarian aid for Ukraine. Downing Street said the funding will help aid agencies respond to the deteriorating humanitarian situation, creating access to basic necessities and medical supplies such as medicines, syringes, dressings and wound care packs. Mr Johnson said: ""In the last days the world has witnessed awe-inspiring displays of bravery and heroism from the Ukrainian people in response to those who seek to obliterate their freedom by force. ""The UK will not turn our backs in Ukraine's hour of need. We are providing all the economic and military support we can to help those Ukrainians risking everything to protect their country."" The PM went on to describe Ukraine as the UK's ""neighbour"" and said that this was partly because Ukrainians have made ""immeasurable contribution to British society"". Mr Johnson said: ""We are neighbours in the words of the gospel. We are neighbours to Ukraine because Ukrainians are literally our neighbours. ""Hundreds of thousands have come to live and work in this country over the decades, making an immeasurable contribution to British society and that is the reason why we are neighbours. That's one reason."" He then went on to refer to the story of the Good Samaritan in the Bible. Mr Johnson said: ""And then we are neighbours because we share Ukrainian ideals of freedom and democracy and independence. ""We must not and cannot allow those ideals to be trampled on and crushed on our European continent and we will not - and that is the second reason why we are your neighbours. ""There is a more fundamental point and this is the point that Jesus was actually getting at in that parable of the Good Samaritan, which is that, even if we did not feel those emotional ties as we do, even if we did not have that political bond, the geo-strategic bond between us, it would still be right to help Ukraine in any way that we can."" Also yesterday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said ministers were ""urgently"" examining the current visa rules for Ukrainians fleeing war. When Ms Truss was told that anyone who has no connection to the UK cannot get in, and asked if that will be changed, Ms Truss said: ""We are looking urgently at what we can do. ""We're working with European partners about how we support refugees who are leaving Ukraine. So, yes, is the answer."" Her Labour counterpart David Lammy described the current visa restrictions for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK as ""totally unacceptable"" and ""bureaucratic"". Labour leader Keir Starmer has also called on ministers to take a ""humanitarian approach"" to provide ""sanctuary for those who are fleeing from Russian aggression, fleeing from this invasion, fleeing for their lives"". While Tory grandee Sir Roger Gale has tweeted: ""We have to offer a safe haven for refugees from Soviet oppression as we have done in the past.

A class action lawsuit is being prepared over ""inordinate and unreasonable delays"" in processing hundreds of visa applications made in March. Figures shared with the PA News Agency last week, compiled by would-be hosts, show there were at least 800 Ukrainian refugees still waiting for visas after applying within the first two weeks of the scheme opening. The groups behind the action, Vigil 4 Visas and Taking Action Over the Homes for Ukraine Visa Delays, say the delays have put people in Ukraine and border countries at risk, and heaped ""considerable pressure and strain"" on UK hosts. Lawyers for the groups are planning to send a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Office this week. Katherine Klinger, who has helped organise vigils outside the Home Office over the past week, told PA: ""Perhaps the most striking thing I've noticed is the utter despair, shame and sense of responsibility so many hosts report. ""Hosts are in tears sometimes when they report to us what has happened in the past six weeks - dozens of emails, phone calls, letters, trips to the Home Office, MPs' involvement etc - it's very humbling."" The groups are due to launch an online Crowdfunder on Tuesday morning to raise up to £15,000 to help pay for the legal costs. The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes. Government spokesperson The legal letter will highlight ten cases of Ukrainians who are still waiting for their visas after applying during the days after the Homes for Ukraine scheme first opened on March 18. These include the case of a Ukrainian mother and her daughter, aged under 10, who applied for their visas around five weeks ago. The mother received her visa on April 18 but the little girl is still waiting. PA has reported on multiple similar cases where family members, usually with young children, are waiting for longer than their relatives for permission to travel. The legal action is being prepared by Amanda Jones, an immigration and public law barrister, and follows a previous successful individual challenge, the group said. They said the judicial review would be brought on the grounds that the Home Office has a policy of delaying the March applications, and deciding later applications instead; or that the system is so chaotic and unstable that it is unreasonable. A Government spokesperson said: ""In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. Over 86,000 visas have been issued so Ukrainians can live and work in the UK.

2073,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,14/3/2022,866 words,Benjamin Cooper,What to know about the scheme for Britons to house Ukrainian refugees,"People keen to offer refugees shelter in the UK can register their interest in sponsoring Ukrainians through the Government's new humanitarian scheme from Monday. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove has said the process of matching Britons with people fleeing the conflict will take place from Friday, while he expects the first refugees to use the new route will make their way to the UK by the end of the week. Mr Gove said more than 3,000 visas have so far been issued to Ukrainians seeking help in the UK, with the Cabinet minister estimating ""tens of thousands"" more will be provided.  - What is the scheme?  The Homes for Ukraine programme will allow individuals, charities, community groups and businesses to bring people escaping the war to safety - even if they have no ties to the UK. Anyone with a room or home available can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family, though those offering will be vetted and Ukrainian applicants will undergo security checks.  - How long can refugees stay with a family or individual?  Members of the public will be able to nominate a Ukrainian family to stay with them for at least six months. Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years' leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services.  - What security checks will be carried out?  The exact detail is not known, but Mr Gove has said steps will be taken to ensure people who might be ""intent on exploitation"" are prevented from ""abusing"" the new scheme. The Cabinet minister told Sky News: ""We absolutely do need to make sure, first of all, that the people in Ukraine are who they say they are, so there need to be some security checks there. ""There's been understandable concern about the scheme being exploited possibly by criminal elements. So, that's the first thing. ""Then the second thing is we do need to make sure that people here ... are in a position to provide that support, which is why there will need to be security checks as well to make sure that those - and I think it would only ever be a tiny minority, but still - those who might be intent on exploitation can be prevented from abusing the system."" A spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said the charity did not want to see ""unnecessary barriers"" built into the process, but ""it is vital child protection is built into every stage of the Government's and local authorities' response to this crisis"".  - Is there any compensation for hosting?  Britons offering accommodation to Ukrainian refugees will receive a ""thank you"" payment of £350 per month.

Mr Gove has said he would personally take in a Ukrainian refugee and Academy Award-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch said from the Baftas red carpet on Sunday that he hopes to take part in the scheme. But there has been criticism too, with the Refugee Council noting unlike the UK all EU countries have waived visa requirements for Ukrainians in the short term. Council chief executive Enver Solomon told The Guardian the UK scheme was ""effectively a managed migration route, which is not suitable to use to respond to a humanitarian crisis"". Mr Solomon also said the programme should only be one part of Britain's response to the crisis. ""But if it's going to work, it needs to be delivered with all the right resource and all the necessary entitlements for Ukrainians - so they're able to get all the healthcare they need, access housing benefit - because the reality is, the sponsor arrangement will be a short-term measure,"" he said. ""This conflict doesn't look like it's going to end quickly. There needs to be a clear pathway to longer-term accommodations."" There have been also concerns about the tight timeframe the Government has provided, with the NSPCC in its statement calling it an ""ambitious turnaround"". The charity said it was ""essential that the Government works closely with local authorities, the fostering community, charities and other key local partners to ensure this sponsorship scheme is ultimately safe; has appropriate levels of support for traumatised Ukrainian children who have fled bloodshed, and on-going assistance available for their sponsors"".",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy

Aodha,Refugees may have to stay at Dublin airport as Citywest reaches capacity,"Refugees arriving in Ireland may have to stay at Dublin Airport overnight as the Citywest welcome hub has reached capacity. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, the Department of Children, Equality and Integration said there had been a “significant” increase in the number of people seeking accommodation in recent weeks. This has resulted in the transit centre at Citywest reaching capacity and a decision being taken to put a pause on new arrivals until numbers reduce. Between then and now, the Department said that those arriving at the airport “may have to wait there if arriving overnight”, and that supports will be provided to them by an NGO. If room becomes available at Citywest, families and those with vulnerabilities will be prioritised where possible, the Department said. For asylum seekers or those claiming temporary protection, the Department said if accommodation is not immediately available, they will be communicated with and supports will be offered to them through NGOs where possible. Those who have alternative accommodation options are asked to avail of these, “including pledged accommodation”, the Department said. The Ukrainian Embassy was also briefed on the development by officials from the Department. The Government warned back in July that it was facing a “severe shortage” of accommodation for arriving Ukrainians, which resulted in a number of asylum seekers having to stay in a Dublin Airport terminal overnight. Ukrainian refugees were temporarily living in tents at the Gormanstown military camp in Co Meath as other accommodation was sourced. Since then, most of the thousands of units of student accommodation that were used to house some international protection applicants are now unavailable as the housing need continues to grow. Departments were asked to list possible buildings in their possession that could be repurposed to house Ukrainians and other refugees and asylum seekers. The government is also considering whether to charge refugees who have been granted full status and who are working full time rent, if they are still staying in Direct Provision centres. Ireland is now accommodating more than 58,000 people: around 42,000 Ukrainian nationals and 16,000 international protection applicants. This figures compares with 7,250 at the same time last year. The Department said that “access to suitable accommodation is severely constrained”. “Current projections indicate a shortfall of 15,000 beds by December as the number of Ukrainians and IP applicants arriving is expected to remain at elevated levels. “To date, the Department has contracted approximately 25% of hotel beds in Ireland, alongside hostels, guest houses, pledged accommodation, sports stadiums, scout facilities, tented accommodation and modular units. “It continues to work to explore all suitable offers as it has done since March 2022.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-10,0,Conditions

Almost five days after their initial announcement, Kunis and Kutcher have managed to raise over $18m (£13m) for people in need.  Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine on 24 February, describing it as a ""special military operation"" to disarm the eastern European country and remove leaders who he described as neo-Nazis. Nato and its allies see this as a pretext for an invasion to conquer the entire of Ukraine and install a pro-Russian administration. The war in Ukraine has forced over two million residents to flee the country, and hundreds have either died or have been injured. This is the fastest exodus of people Europe has seen since the Second World War, officials have said, warning that the war could displace nearly five million people. Russia has promised to allow five humanitarian corridors to be formed to let people flee major cities under attack by Putin's forces. The firing of weapons in Ukraine will stop from 7am GMT (10am Moscow time) on Wednesday, according to Russian news agency Tass. The corridors will lead out of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Mariupol.

Whether it’s a big leg up or a smaller helping hand we all need support sometimes. It’s part of being human -as social creatures we lift each other up when we need it. Most people would be happy to help a friend, neighbour, colleague or even a stranger if they needed it -but a lot of people are too afraid to ask. In fact, according to online research from YouGov into the cost of living, even if people are struggling financially, 77 percent would be very unlikely to ask for help. We think that needs to change. There is power in asking for help and there is joy in giving it. At GoFundMe we see thousands of people sign up to help others everyday. In February, as Russia invaded Ukraine, fundraisers sprang up offering support to those who needed it the most. During the first week of the war a donation was made every minute towards the people of Ukraine. Every single one of those donations came from someone who wanted to help. From the word go, the Association of Ukrainian’s in Great Britain started a fundraiser to get humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees. They managed to raise more than £2,600,000 so far -making it the biggest campaign ever seen on GoFundMe in the UK. That’s a record breaking amount of help. We’ve seen help from individuals who were so affected by coverage they were seeing on the news they were moved to help. Laura and Ken packed up their motorhome Molly with essential supplies and sweets and drove to the Ukrainian border to help refugees who had just fled. By asking people to sponsor their trip they raised more than £6,000 to donate to British Ukrainian Aid.  David Fricker and his friends have travelled to Ukraine to deliver thousands of teddy bears for displaced children -complete with translated messages of love from kids in the UK. His main goal is to make children feel safe when they cross the border. Closer to home, as the UK experiences a major cost of living crisis, the most vulnerable in our society are choosing between heating, eating or paying their bills. In April, after Ofgen lifted the energy cap, bills rose by a massive 54 percent and they are expected to go up again come autumn. Lancashire plumber James Anderson has been helping those in need since last year with his community initiative Depher, fixing boilers for free and paying off heating bills. And when the crisis hit this year, he teamed up again with GoFundMe to launch an emergency appeal to help those struggling with the rising costs. One woman helped by the initiative described how she was left ‘actually in tears’ when she found out she would be able to put her heating on. As times get tougher help, happiness and community is needed more than ever. That’s what society is all about -stepping up and helping those when help is needed. That’s why GoFundMe is supporting the Independent’s Happy List, which shines a light on the people who’ve changed the world for the better by offering a helping hand. Each of the people or groups chosen have done something which is worth celebrating. If you’re reading this and thinking that there’s something, someone or charity you want to support, why not ask ‘’how can I help?’’ and start a GoFundMe today. *YouGov cost of living research was carried out with 2,144 adults between 5th -6th April 2022.

A furious Sir Roger Gale told the Commons that ""in any normal administration"", her behaviour would have been a resignation matter. Boris Johnson's government has been blasted as ""inhumane"" by France over its treatment of Ukrainians arriving at the port, who are being turned away and told to apply for visas in Paris or Brussels. Ms Patel has come under fire for implementing a system which is much less generous than in other European countries, resulting in just 300 being granted the right to enter Britain by Monday, at a time when Poland is hosting more than 1 million and other EU states have opened their doors to hundreds of thousands more. In the House of Commons on Monday, Ms Patel twice claimed that she had set up a visa application centre (VAC) on the way to the French port to process applications from people fleeing the Russian invasion. However, when told later in the debate that Downing Street did not believe that a VAC was yet in operation, she backtracked, telling shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper that ""we are setting up another VAC en route to Calais"". Instead of admitting that she had given inaccurate information, Ms Patel wrongly told Ms Cooper that she had already ""made quite clear"" that the centre had not yet been set up and accused the Labour frontbencher of mishearing her earlier comments. What she had in fact told MPs was that ""we have set up a bespoke VAC en route to Calais but away from the port"".  The Independent is raising money for the people of Ukraine - if you would like to donate then please click here for our GoFundMe page.   So far our appeal has raised £115,000 for the people of Ukraine, but they need more, please give what you can to help support them.  The Home Office later confirmed in a statement that the UK was ""in the process"" of setting up a VAC in France to process applications from Ukrainians referred to it by Border Force. Ministers today said that it was likely to be sited in Lille, around 75 miles away from Calais. Veteran Tory backbencher Sir Roger, who asked Ms Patel about the situation in Calais during Monday's debate, said it was clear that the home secretary's reply was ""untrue"".  The Home Secretary said yesterday that a visa centre had already been set up in Calais. This was untrue and under any normal administration that would be a resigning matter. pic.twitter.com/ZPGpfwesCy - Sir Roger Gale MP (@SirRogerGale) March 8, 2022 ""The home secretary has misled the House of Commons,"" he said. ""In response to my question yesterday she said 'I have made it clear, in terms of the visa application centre that has now been set up en-route to Calais that we have staff in Calais'. ""That is untrue. There was no visa application centre 'en-route to Calais' and refugees from the war in Ukraine are being sent back to Paris or Brussels to obtain visas. ""What is needed is a visa waiver scheme that allows Ukrainian children and adults with a valid Ukrainian passport to be allowed into Britain without unnecessary bureaucracy and delay."" He told the House of Commons today: ""There is no visa centre at Lille. A week ago the home secretary announced a humanitarian sponsorship visa. There is as yet no humanitarian sponsor visa."" Sir Roger called on the government to allow anyone with a Ukrainian passport into the UK without a visa. There was no immediate response from the Home Office this morning to The Independent's query over whether Ms Patel will now correct the record or apologise for misleading the Commons. Unlike other European countries, the UK is demanding that Ukrainians seeking sanctuary apply for visas, which are granted only to those with family links in Britain.

2112,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,14/3/2022,801 words,Via AP news wire,'I wish this war would end': Ukrainian refugees reach 2.8M," As Russia 's war in Ukraine becomes a grim new reality for millions of Ukrainians, the tens of thousands who make the increasingly treacherous journey toward safety in the European Union each day are left with no sense of when, or if, they'll ever return home.  More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, according to the U.N. refugee agency, the vast majority seeking refuge in Poland which has taken in more than 1.7 refugees in the last 19 days. In the Polish border town of Przemysl, some of those who are fleeing, mostly women and children, are exhausted and express a simple wish that the war and violence would stop. ""All day crying from the pain of having to part with loved ones, with my husband, my parents,"" said Alexandra Beltuygova, 33, who fled from Dnipro, a city between the embattled metropolises of Kyiv and Mariupol.  ""I understand that we may not see them. I wish this war would end,"" she said. At a refugee center in Suceava in northern Romania, 28-year-old Lesia Ostrovska watched over her 1-year-old son as her daughter, who is 8, played nearby with other children displaced by the war. ""I left my husband, my father, my mother, my grandparents,"" said Ostrovska, who is from Chernivtsi in western Ukraine. ""It's hard with kids, in the bus, here in this situation ... We hope that the war is finished soon and we can go back home."" As the fighting, now in its third week, continues to exact a grievous human toll in Ukraine with Russian troops bombarding many of the country's most populous cities, the number of those crossing into countries on the eastern edge of the EU has begun to slowly wane in recent days.  In Hungary , where around 255,000 refugees have entered so far, only 9,000 people crossed the border with Ukraine on Sunday compared to more than twice that on March 1, according to police.  In Slovakia, where more than 200,000 people have fled, fewer than 9,000 crossed the border on Sunday, down from more than 12,000 four days earlier. And in Poland on Sunday, about 82,000 refugees were admitted, down from an earlier daily peak of around 129,000.  Still, those who managed to flee the violence continued to arrive in countries on Ukraine's western border. In Przemysl, some recounted being witnesses to military attacks on civilians, something Russia continues to deny.  ""I saw destroyed houses and fighting. I saw a lot of tanks when I was driving from Kyiv. I know that a house near us was completely destroyed this morning,"" said Inessa Armashova, 40, a resident of the Ukrainian capital. ""Many people fled. But many cannot leave, sick children or sick elderly people."" The continued push by Russian forces toward Kyiv comes a day after Russia escalated its offensive by launching airstrikes close to the Polish border, raising fears in the West that the fight was edging closer to the EU and members of the NATO military alliance.  Those strikes, which involved waves of deadly Russian missiles hitting a military training base less than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Ukraine's border with NATO member Poland on Sunday, killed at least 35 people and appeared to be the westernmost target struck during Russia's 19-day invasion of Ukraine. Residents of the Polish village of Wielkie Oczy, just two kilometers (over a mile) from the border, were jolted awake in the middle of the night by the sounds of the blasts.  ""My son went out to the balcony and the neighbors were already awoken and the dogs in the whole village started to bark,"" said Franciek Sawicki, 77, who heard the missile attack. ""We could see the glow above the forest. It was very noisy and I could hear a loud explosion. And at that moment I knew it was an attack near the border."" The proximity of the attack to Poland dashed the sense of safety in western Ukraine, which until now had mostly remained free of Russian attacks, and raised the possibility that the NATO alliance could be drawn into the fight. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called it a ""black day,"" and again urged NATO leaders to establish a no-fly zone over the country, a plea that the West has said could escalate the war to a nuclear confrontation. But Anjela, 55, a Ukrainian refugee from Poltava who wouldn't give her last name, said after arriving in Poland that only a NATO intervention could bring an end to the violence in Ukraine. ""I don't know when I will see my husband. I don't know when my children will return home,"" she said. ""I beg you, it depends only on you, close the sky, everything else we will do ourselves."" ___ Justin Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary.

The recent invasion in Ukraine is expected to drive up the price of gas if supplies from Russia are impeded or stopped altogether, with fears household bills could see a further increase. But Sir Ed has urged the Prime Minister to increase the sanctions on associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin , and use the cash to fund a package of measures to help Britons mitigate any rises. I think whether it's Putin's cronies or Russian energy firms, I think they should foot the bill of any gas price hike following Russia's invasion of Ukraine Sir Ed Davey Speaking to journalists during a visit to Scotland on Friday, Sir Ed said there were ""far more"" people with links to Mr Putin who could be on the receiving end of sanctions. ""One thing I think we should look at is we go after their assets, freezing them and beginning the process of seizing the assets of Putin's cronies who have money and property in the UK and using that as a sort of oligarch tax and using some of that money for insulating the UK from the gas price spike that we're seeing,"" he said. ""I think whether it's Putin's cronies or Russian energy firms, I think they should foot the bill of any gas price hike following Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" Money seized should go to doubling winter fuel payments and expanding the warm home discount to include up to 7.5 million people in the UK, Sir Ed said.

""I think the UK should be leading an internationally co-ordinated humanitarian response where the UK is welcoming and prepared to house far more refugees from Ukraine,"" the Lib Dem leader said.

Hundreds of Afghan families are being evicted in Berlin to create space for incoming refugees fleeing Ukraine , Foreign Policy reported. The German government justified it by saying that Afghans were being removed from ""arrival centres"" designed for short term stays. However, activists said that some refugees had been evicted from the accommodation they had lived in for years.  ""The evictions purposefully weren't publicised,"" said Tareq Alaows, a board member of the Berlin Refugee Council.  ""Some people had lived in their homes for years and were ripped out of their social structures, including children who were moved to locations far from their respective schools."" ""Few people's living conditions improved, but most were afraid to speak up, afraid it could impact their immigration status,"" Mr Alaows told Foreign Policy, explaining that around 10 residences had been emptied in Berlin. Berlin's senate department for integration, labour and social services, which oversees the housing of refugees, said that the decision was ""based on operationally necessary and difficult considerations"" and that there was no alternative because Ukrainians, including many women with children, needed a roof over their heads and a bed. ""We regret that this caused additional hardships to the Afghan families [and that] the affected people had to move out of their familiar surroundings and now possibly have to keep up with their social connections with great difficulty,"" said Stefan Strauss, the department's press secretary.  Mr Strauss said Berlin had a total of 83 different accommodations for refugees, already housing some 22,000 people, but that arriving Ukrainians needed to be consolidated to a few defined arrival centers to simplify processing. Evicted Afghans were given other ""permanent"" accommodation of equivalent quality, excluding shared bathrooms and kitchens, he added. Mr Alaows of the Berlin Refugee Council said that although the fault is not with the Ukrainian refugees, there was a difference between how they have been treated compared to Afghans fleeing home. ""The last months showed that different treatment of refugees is possible, and this needs to be systematically anchored in our society,"" Mr Alaows said. More than 160,000 Ukrainian refugees have been officially registered in Germany, but their real numbers are thought to be much higher as Ukrainians can enter Germany without visas and there are no thorough controls along the Polish-German border. Berlin has become the main gateway for tens of thousands of refugees, with around 7,500 arriving at the train station every day after the invasion began on 24 February. Because city officials were initially slow to react to the massive influx, thousands of volunteers have stepped up to help cater to refugees. In the last 10 years, around 630,000 Afghans applied for asylum in EU countries with some of the highest figures in Germany, while in 2015 the nation agreed to take in 500,000 Syrian refugees a year.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said the potential extension of the visa period for Ukrainians in the UK is being kept under “consistent review”, adding that this “includes whether to require a fee”. The first visas issued as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme – launched last year following the Russian invasion – will expire in March 2025. We keep the need for a possible extension of UK sanctuary, beyond March 2025, under consistent review. This includes whether to require a feeThe Home Office has said it is reviewing what might be needed beyond that date. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick Scottish National Party MP Patrick Grady had asked a question in Parliament about whether the Home Office would ensure there are “no fees chargeable for any extension to the Ukrainian visa schemes”. In a written response earlier this week, Mr Jenrick said: “In line with the situation in Ukraine, working closely with the Ukrainian Government, as well as our international counterparts, we keep the need for a possible extension of UK sanctuary, beyond March 2025, under consistent review. This includes whether to require a fee. “We are mindful that permission will start to expire, for the first arrivals under our Ukrainian schemes, from March 2025, and their need for certainty beyond that point to help them to plan ahead.” They are not here because they want to be, they are here because there is a war in their country and they can't go back yet Kitty Hamilton, Vigil for Visas Kitty Hamilton, co-founder of the advocacy group Vigil for Visas, has hosted a number of Ukrainian refugees, and said that so long as the reasons for Ukrainians needing to come to the UK do not change, “I don’t see why the rules for their stay should change”. She told the PA news agency: “They are not here because they want to be, they are here because there is a war in their country and they can’t go back yet. “As we said right from the beginning, the vast majority aren’t going to stay much beyond the end of this war. The problem is that we don’t know when that will be. It seems unfair to add to this insecurity with a lack of clarity on whether our guests can stay here in the UK.” A report by the National Audit Office last month said Ukrainians must be given certainty over their futures including around visa extensions. The report said: “The Government will soon need to take important decisions about the future of the scheme, including whether to extend visas beyond three years, and whether to extend funding for local authorities and sponsors, which currently finishes before visas expire.

Home Office officials are reportedly considering it as a way to prevent migrants who cannot be housed in limited detention sites from absconding.  The Illegal Migration Act places a duty on the government to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another “safe” third country.  However, as spaces in Home Office accommodation are in short supply, officials have been tasked with a “deep dive” into alternatives, according to The Times. While the preferred solution is to increase the number of detention places, electronic tagging has been mooted, as has cutting off financial allowances to someone who fails to report regularly to the Home Office. UK charity Refugee Council criticised the idea, claiming it would see vulnerable people “treated as mere objects”. Chief executive Enver Solomon said: “It’s treating people as mere objects rather than vulnerable men, women and children in search of safety who should always be treated with compassion and humanity, in the same way we welcomed Ukrainian refugees.  “This is not who we are as a country nor the Britain we aspire to be.” And a refugee who fled Afghanistan said electronically tagging asylum seekers was “completely wrong and unacceptable”. Gulwali Passarlay told The Independent the only point of the plans was to “make the public think we are doing something”, and accused ministers of being “cruel”. His friend has been forced by the Home Office to wear an ankle tag since arriving in the UK as a refugee, which Mr Passarlay says has taken a significant toll on his mental health. “How would normal people feel if they were electronically tagged just for being who they are?” he said. “We're surveilling the most vulnerable people in our society,” he added. The government’s plans emerged days after Home Office figures showed the backlog of asylum cases in the UK has hit a new record high, in a blow to Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats” and cut processing times.  A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June, up 44 per cent from 122,213 a year earlier and the highest figure since records began in 2010. The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year-on-year and another record high. In a bid to bring down the £6m a day cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels, ministers are trying to move migrants onto the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset.  But these efforts faced a fresh setback on Sunday as The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) sent a legal threat to the Home Office accusing ministers of “callous disregard” for the safety of those on board.  Asked about electronic tags for migrants on Monday morning, home secretary Suella Braverman said ministers are considering “a range of options”. “We have a couple of thousand detention places in our existing removal capacity,” she told Sky News.  “We will be working intensively to increase that but it’s clear we’re exploring a range of options, all options, to ensure that we have that level of control over people so that they can flow through our systems swiftly to enable us to thereafter remove them from the United Kingdom.” But Labour’s shadow employment minister Justin Madders described the plans as “just another gimmick”. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Madders said: “The only people you tag are criminals. And my understanding is that people who are coming to this country seeking asylum are not criminals. “They are usually people fleeing persecution. And if there’s a problem with people absconding, this is the first I’ve heard about it. “Clearly the solution to that is actually to get on and process the asylum applications a lot quicker than is happening. “I think this is just another gimmick that is not dealing with the root of the problem at all.” Mr Madders also said it is “pathetic” for the government to blame “lefty lawyers” and Labour for failings in its asylum policy. “They ought to own this problem,” he said. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said it is “the latest in a long line of gimmicks” thought up by the home secretary.  “It’s time they put in the hard work to clear their record asylum backlog so we can get people out of expensive hotels,” he said.  In June last year, the Home Office launched a 12-month pilot scheme to fit migrants with tags.  The tagging pilot allowed the electronic monitoring of asylum seekers who are declared inadmissible after travelling through safe countries and includes those selected for transfer to Rwanda.  The Independent revealed an asylum seeker electronically tagged by the government after being selected for removal to Rwanda was launching a legal challenge against the move. The man said that after being tortured and trafficked in Sudan and Libya he has been treated “like an animal” in the UK. A psychiatric report found that being forced to wear a tag had worsened his mental health, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder , and increased the risk of self-harm and suicide. The Home Office said it is “committed to the removal of foreign criminals and those with no right to be in the UK”. A spokesman said: “That is why we have introduced measures under the Illegal Migration Act which will ensure those arriving in the UK illegally may be detained and swiftly removed to their country of origin or a safe third country. “We are now considering a range of options to reduce the rate of absconding.”",Broadsheet,0,2023-08,1,Conditions
1908,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,11/3/2022,626 words,Kate Ng,Ukrainian refugees: How can I take part in the new sponsorship scheme?,"Britons will soon be asked to open their homes to Ukrainians fleeing their country, as part of a new ""sponsored"" humanitarian route to allow more refugees to travel to the UK. The route will give Ukrainians without family links to the UK the opportunity come to the country in order to escape the war against Russia.  It comes after the government faced criticism for its response to the refugee crisis. Michael Gove, the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary, is expected to set out details of the new route on Monday. Prime minister Boris Johnson told MPs that the route will allow ""everybody in this country [to] offer a home to people fleeing Ukraine "". Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is entering its third week and more than two million people have fled the country. As of Monday 7 March, just 50 Ukrainians had been granted visas to enter the UK and refugees have reported facing too much paperwork to procure the visas. At the time, this was just 1 per cent of the 5,535 people who had applied to the scheme since Saturday. Here is everything we know about how the scheme will work and how you can get involved:  What is it?  The new sponsorship scheme would reportedly give British individuals, charities, businesses and community groups the opportunity to offer rooms to those escaping the conflict. According to The Daily Telegraph , ministers will announce a hotline and website where vetted individuals and organisations can offer up a space to incoming refugees. Those who enter the UK through the new route will be allowed to stay for an initial period of 12 months. They will be entitled to work, claim benefits and access public services, it has been reported. A spokesperson for the government said: ""The routes we have put in place follow extensive engagement with Ukrainian partners. ""This is a rapidly moving and complex picture and as the situation develops we will continue to keep our support under constant review.""  How can I help?  The government has not yet launched its webpage or hotline, but once it does, you can register to offer accommodation and employment to Ukrainian refugees. A similar sponsorship programme was launched in 2016 on a community level that allowed community groups including charities, faith groups, churches and businesses to help refugees resettle in the UK. It was launched in response to the global refugee crisis, which saw 10.3 million people become newly displaced within the year. The UNHCR estimated that by the end of 2016, the global population of forcibly displaced people grew from 33.9 million in 1997 to a record high of 65.6 million in 2016. Any member of the public could register through an online service to offer housing, work or support for resettling. These include helping people access public services, arranging transport and running errands, and welcoming people into the local area.  What is the current route for Ukrainian refugees?  As of Friday 11 March, Ukrainian refugees need to have family in the UK in order to apply for a visa to travel here. From Tuesday 15 March, they will be able to apply for the visas online. Until then, those with family links are still having to travel to visa application centres in Ukraine to give biometric information, such as fingerprints. Boris Johnson told MPs earlier this week that ""almost 1,000 visas"" have been issued since the start of the war, and that ""we expect those numbers to rise to in the regions of hundreds of thousands"". You can also help by donating to the people of Ukraine. Funds will go towards humanitarian aid, psychological support, and medical supplies for paramedics and doctors on the frontlines.",Broadsheet,0,2022-03,1,Policy

The Golden Retriever had pitched up seemingly out of nowhere that morning, passing through no-man's land to lay his weary head on a piece of covered tarmac just past the Csengersima checkpoint on the Hungarian-Rumanian border.  A woman from the Hungarian Red Cross bent down to offer him food, water and a kind word, but he was too weak to respond, so they called a local animal shelter to pick him up. Six hours later, he was still there.  It was a pitiful sight but also one that flew in the face of the extraordinary care we had seen the Ukrainian refugees show for the pets they had brought with them to escape theRussian bombs.  We had witnessed this during the second week of the invasion at several crossings on the Polish-Ukrainian border and again, in the last week at the Hungarian border - and many told us of the pain they felt about larger pets, mostly dogs, they had been forced to leave behind.  We watched as refugees who had queued for hours on foot carrying young children and their worldly possessions still found the wherewithal to physically carry their pet, often lugging them in pet carriers along with weighty supplies of pet food.  Frequently the ones carrying the pets were young children. Nobody knows exactly how many of the 4 million refugees who fled the country have taken pets, but pet travel specialists PBS Pet Travel estimate that more than 1.25 million pets have crossed the border.  One of the untold stories of this war is surely that of how taking care of a beloved pet at a time of personal and collective trauma can be a helpful, even healing, thing to do.  At Kroscienko on the Polish-Ukrainian border, where refugees endured sub-zero temperatures, we saw Olena Boiko, 39, emerge from her 20-hour journey from Kyiv with her Chihuahua, Dolores, peeking out of her coat.  At the same crossing we saw Vatazhok, 87, on crutches and her friend, Zhanna Zabrodska, 85, in a wheelchair, muster the energy to carry their respective cats, Syoma and Masha.  ""Come feel Masha shivering with cold through my rucksack,"" said Zhanna, tears streaming down her face for her struggling feline companion. The gritty octogenarians had travelled two days from embattled Kharkiv in the north after hiding in a freezing basement for 11 days and in fleeing to save themselves had thought to save their cats too.  There was also sadness for pets left behind. When Sasha Bubnovska, 28, crossed into Poland with her daughters Sofia, 6, and Mia, 2, and pug, Bella, after a four-day journey fleeing Irpin and leaving her husband at the border, her relief to be safe was palpable, but her thoughts were for her black Labrador, Clode, too big to fit in their car.  She showed me photos of Clode looking mournful as they left him lying on his own in front of the sofa. Sasha said: ""It is hard to look at these photos.""  They left house keys with a neighbour and asked him to put out food and water for Clode, but Sasha did not know the neighbour well and with Kharkiv under bombardment, she couldn't be sure if Clode was still alive. ""I am not sure I will see him again,"" she said. ""We brought Bella but Clode was part of our family. I feel I betrayed him.""  At a nearby refugee reception centre in Lodyna just over the Polish border, a young girl arrived with her mother after a long journey from eastern Ukraine and the first thing she did after being given a camp-bed was to feed and cuddle the rats in her pet carrier.  They immediately became a focal point and a way of connecting to other refugee children in the shelter. Elsewhere we saw several hamsters and even mice.  At the cavernous Bok Stadium in Budapest, a national sports centre being used as a filtration point for thousands of refugees arriving at Budapest train station, one of the charities was Animal Aid.   The Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here .  They had set up a stand offering free pet food, professional advice and veterinary information.  A spokesman said: ""Ninety-nine per cent of the pets people have brought are dogs and cats, but we are seeing the odd rat.""  He held up a pet carrier with a very busy white rat that somebody had found abandoned and handed in just minutes before.  ""It's in good shape,"" he said. ""The cage is clean and well looked after. We don't know if it was left behind on purpose or accidentally.""  Other refugees were letting their canine pets stretch their legs and as they strutted across the blue floor of the sports centre alongside their owners, they looked as happy and well looked after as contestants for a Crufts international dog show at Alexandra Palace.  Initially the EU had imposed no limits on the number of pets refugees could take with them, and border officers allowed them to cross without papers, but according to anecdotal reports from aid volunteers, limits have now been imposed, not just at the Ukrainian border but in some onward countries, and this had led to a rise in pets being abandoned at the border.  Hester Berg, a volunteer who since the war began has driven four times from her home in Vienna to various points on the Ukrainian border to deliver a car full of pet food, said: ""Refugees have told us that they have changed the laws regarding pets. Initially you could have five animals per car but now they've cut down so some refugees are having to make a choice at the border between which pets to take and which to leave behind. In other cases, they get their pets through the Ukrainian border only to face a limit at the second EU country they enter. We have rescued 25 dogs at various border crossings. It's heart-breaking.""  The Independent has a proud history of campaigning for the rights of the most vulnerable, and we first ran our Refugees Welcome campaign during the war in Syria in 2015. Now, as we renew our campaign and launch this petition in the wake of the unfolding Ukrainian crisis, we are calling on the government to go further and faster to ensure help is delivered.

Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that setting up temporary police checks on border crossings would help Germany prevent the smuggling and trafficking of people. She added that the increased border checks would need to be combined with the already ongoing random police checks that are being carried out. Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic belong to the European Union's visa-free zone, commonly known as the Schengen Area. “Respective additional border police measures are currently being reviewed,” a German Interior Ministry spokesperson told the German news agency dpa. Faeser is also discussing with the Czech Republic the possibility of German police officers operating on Czech territory, similar to an agreement that Germany has struck with Switzerland.  “In close coordination with Swiss police forces, German police officers are allowed to inspect on Swiss territory and to prevent unauthorized entry (into Germany),"" the minister said. Faeser also demanded closer cooperation on migration between the EU and Turkey, and said that the current EU-Turkey deal required an “update.” The number of people who migrated to Germany in 2022 was higher than in any other year, according to the German federal statistics agency Destatis, with about 2.67 million people having entered the country in 2022. Included in the number are 1.1 million Ukrainian refugees who sought safety in Germany after Russian launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",Broadsheet,0,2023-09,0,Policy

The Financial Times first reported the chancellor will make the lifting of the cap one of the few measures to survive from Kwasi Kwarteng ’s disastrous mini-Budget, amid speculation about the “difficult decisions” that Mr Hunt and the prime minister are likely to take as they try to find up to £60bn from a combination of hikes and spending cuts. Earlier, Rishi Sunak urged banking executives “to embrace pay restraint” in order not to exacerbate inflation. The Budget is widely expected to raise finances through stealth taxes by freezing the rates at which workers begin paying higher rates of tax, with inflation and pay increases dragging more people into higher bands. But tough spending cuts are likely too, with Mr Hunt reportedly eyeing up plans to cut funding for the government’s homes for Ukrainian refugees scheme and planning to reduce funds received by councils for some of the services for refugees hosted by UK families.

The MS Victoria , which is docked in Leith, Edinburgh , will continue to provide “safe accommodation for displaced people” until June 2023 with the option to extend. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, however, accused the Scottish Government of “quietly” extending the contract, according to reports by LBC on Friday. On Friday evening, Mr Cole-Hamilton told the PA news agency: “This isn’t a new life, it’s a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution. “I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish Government as being humiliatingly underprepared. “They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork. “I don’t think when these Ukrainians are fleeing unimaginable atrocities at the hands of the Russians, I don’t think they dreamed about a very crowded passenger ship.” Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified. Minister with Special Responsibility for Refugees from Ukraine Neil Gray said: “We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary welcome accommodation, however, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community. “We’ve extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships. “Across Scotland work is under way to increase the availability of suitable and sustainable longer-term accommodation. The Scottish Government continues to work closely with local authority partners to increase longer-term housing opportunities for displaced people across Scotland. “We’ve provided up to £50 million of funding for local authorities and registered social landlords to bring void properties back into use and increase the available housing supply. “This includes the recent allocation of more than £6 million from the Ukraine Longer Term Resettlement Fund to Aberdeen City Council to bring around 500 void properties back into use.” The Scottish Government has urged members of the public to volunteer as hosts for refugees from Ukraine currently in short-term accommodation. Mr Gray added: “We would encourage anyone considering becoming a host to come forward and provide a warm welcome. In recognition of this commitment, hosts can receive thank you payments for up to 12 months. “I’m extremely grateful to people who are already hosting, as well as those who have already put their details forward and are still waiting to be matched. “I’m proud of the warm welcome the people of Scotland have given to those fleeing the war and the support we are providing to so many thousands of people.” More than 21,500 people with a Scottish sponsor have arrived in the country since the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, representing 20% of all UK arrivals.

Vasyl and Marina Prishchak and their three daughters Maria, 16, Sofia, 10, and Kseniia, 5, travelled from their home in Kyiv to Oahu for a long-awaited holiday visiting their friends Borys and Beata Markin in the middle of February. But, just days into their three-week trip, their dream holiday turned to heartbreak as Russia declared war on Ukraine and they found themselves watching from afar as their home country came under attack. More than one month on, with the planned vacation now over, they remain stuck in the US not knowing if their home close to a Ukrainian military base is even still standing or if they will ever be able to return home. Their cosmetics company has been forced to close and access to their finances has been cut off, according to the Associated Press. The canoe paddling community has rallied around the family in their time of need, with one local homeowner giving them a cottage to stay rent-free for as long as they need in Kaneohe. Thousands of dollars have been raised in donations to support the displaced family, with a GoFundMe organised by one local reaching more than $33,000 on Thursday. Meanwhile, others are helping them in other ways, such as supporting them with immigration questions as they apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). In early March, President Joe Biden announced he was granting TPS to Ukrainians fleeing from the war, enabling Ukrainians to stay and work legally in the US for 18 months. An estimated 75,000 people will be shielded from deportation back to the war zone because of this rule. The Prishchaks said they are thankful for the outpouring of support they have received from the local community in the US.  Mr Prishchak, who has known Mr Markin for three decades, told AP that ""this vacation changed our life"". ""We don't know how we return to Ukraine and what we will do, we will begin from zero, from scratch,"" he said. He said that he feels guilty being on a beautiful island away from his home while his fellow Ukrainian men are unable to leave the country and are now fighting on the frontline. ""It's a really terrible feeling that eats away at you from inside when you understand that all your close relatives are now in a very complicated situation,"" he said.  ""And there's no way you can help them stop this absolute insanity. It's a feeling that simply eats you up inside, you could say.  ""A horrible sensation, an inner guilt that I'm here and not there."" Ms Markin, who has lived with her Ukrainian husband in Hawaii for eight years, said she sees it as ""our responsibility to make sure they are okay here"" as they ""have nowhere to go"". Charlotte Johnson, an Oahu resident who set up the GoFundMe, called on her fellow Americans to ""bring hope to their lives by sharing our aloha"". ""Sadly, we can't help all the Ukrainians, but we can help this family of five,"" she wrote on the fundraising page. ""None of us can even imagine going on a vacation only to find the life left no longer exists."" She added: ""Even the smallest donation will make a difference. To a country half a world away, these five Ukrainians are our touchpoint.  ""Today we can help this Ukrainian family who took a vacation and will never return to the home they knew."" Last week, on the one-month anniversary of the day the war began, Mr Biden unveiled plans to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and other refugees fleeing the country into the US.

She can’t shake the memory of bombs crashing around her, the terror each time the air raid sounded and she had to sprint to the nearest shelter in Kharkiv, her home of three years as she studied medicine.  Six months on from the start of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, though the 19-year-old Nigerian has escaped to safety, she faces yet more anguish. All she wants is to be with her close family in the UK -but while Ukrainian nationals are welcomed to Britain, Samantha is being blocked from doing so. Instead, she is living hundreds of miles away in an unfamiliar city, alone. Several weeks ago, alone in her flat in Duisburg, Germany, Samantha heard fireworks going off outside during a festival. She thought the noises were explosions. “The night it happened, I was watching a movie and started hearing, ‘Boom, boom, boom.’ I had to lay flat on the floor. I called my mum, I was crying. I was telling her I don’t want to die.” The UK government announced two designated schemes for Ukrainian refugees when the war hit: one allowing refugees to join family members in Britain and the other permitting them to join UK citizens willing to host them. However, they required that the applicant either had a Ukrainian passport themselves or was travelling with or joining a Ukrainian national. These restrictions fail to take into account Ukraine’s international population. There were nearly half a million non-Ukrainians with temporary or permanent residence when the Russian invasion started, including more than 76,000 foreign students, mostly from Africa and southeast Asia. Many had chosen to study in Ukraine because they couldn’t access study programmes such as medicine, dentistry and engineering in their home countries, and the Ukrainian university fees are cheaper than in many other European countries. Data from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) shows 325,000 third-country nationals have fled from Ukraine to neighbouring countries since the start of the war. They have become, in effect, Ukraine’s forgotten refugees – though they have fled the same Russian attacks as Ukrainian nationals, they are facing barriers to starting their lives again in the UK and across Europe, an investigation by Lighthouse Reports has found.  The Independent’s Refugees Welcome campaign has called for the UK to lead the way in supporting those forced to flee the war in Ukraine.  ‘I feel very alone’  Samantha’s parents and siblings moved from Nigeria to Sheffield a year ago. They are now settled there: her parents have jobs and her younger siblings are in school. But the government’s exclusion of third-country national residents in Ukraine means she cannot join them, despite all the hardship she has faced. She describes spending two days sleeping on the floor of a metro station in Kyiv and waiting for hours on platforms in the snow due to difficulties boarding trains out of the country – something she attributes in part to racism.  “I thought applying for the scheme would work. The only logical thing I want to do is to be with my family,” says Samantha. “I want to have a normal life back. I want to go to school, I want to study. I want to have goals again. My mum is trying everything, trying to look for every option for how I can join them in the UK, but right now it seems like there’s nothing. I try not to let it get to me, but I feel very alone.” The Home Office refuses to say how many people are in the same position as Samantha – while the department publishes data on applications to the schemes from Ukrainians and their family members, those who do not fit this criteria are excluded. Nonetheless, even those who are related to Ukrainians -indicating that they should be eligible -have a far higher refusal rate than Ukrainian nationals, at 14 per cent compared with 0.4 per cent. A much higher proportion of third-country nationals with Ukrainian family members are also still waiting for a decision on their applications, at 45 per cent compared with 7 per cent.  Fleeing war for the second time  As well as tens of thousands of international students, there were more than 3,000 asylum seekers and refugees in Ukraine when war hit. Many others who moved to Ukraine after fleeing persecution in their own countries are believed to have been on work and business visas. Kamran Mehdipour, 43, had been living in Kyiv for six years on a business visa when he was forced out of his home for a second time – while this time it was Russian bombs that led him to flee, in 2016 he had been forced to escape Iran after threats from the authorities over the political campaigning of his brother, Peyman, now a refugee in the UK. Three days after the invasion started, Kamran rushed out of his rental apartment with nothing but a small rucksack and his three beloved dogs -Ice, Snow, and Darchin. He had to leave behind the grocery shop and deli he had set up in the Ukrainian capital.  “We left in a rush. With two friends, I got a lift to a place 25 kilometres from the Polish border, and we walked the rest,” he says. “I thought I would be able to go home again soon, but three months after I left, my old neighbour went to pick something up and sent me a picture of my apartment -it had been destroyed by a bomb.”  His brother Peyman, now a British citizen who owns a shop owner in Elgin, northern Scotland, contacted the Home Office helpline for advice on how his brother could join him in the UK. He says he was told he could apply under the Ukraine family scheme.  The brothers immediately booked a visa appointment at the visa centre in Berlin and met in Germany to register an application. They then waited for three months to be told they had been refused on the basis that Peyman is not Ukrainian. While Peyman is trying to appeal, Kamran is living in a makeshift refugee camp in Leer, a small town in northwestern Germany. He sleeps on a camp bed separated from other refugees by thin planks of plywood. Most people there are Ukrainians, who arrive and leave again to a new home within a matter of days, he says. Kamran has been there for more than three months. “It’s not good. I feel lost. I feel I don’t belong anywhere,” says the 42-year-old. “When I was in Ukraine I was treated like a Ukrainian. I was being taxed like a Ukrainian. But now I’m here with nothing. I share a bathroom: four toilets, six showers between 150 people.”  ‘Cruel and senseless exclusions’  Anais Crane, a caseworker at charity Here for Good, who is representing the brothers, says her team was contacted by several third-country nationals who had been residing in Ukraine lawfully and were now unable to join family in the UK. “In some cases, they have already fled persecution or internal conflicts in their country of origin, only to be forced to flee again – this time from Ukraine,” she said. “They cannot return to their country of origin.” A UK government spokesperson said they would not comment on individual cases, but added that the Ukraine schemes were designed for Ukrainian nationals and that non-Ukrainians displaced by the war could apply to come to the UK “through one of our safe and legal routes, including work and study visa schemes”. However, experts point out that these routes are difficult to access. Madeleine Sumption, of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, says: “In theory non-Ukrainians displaced by the war could apply for other visas, but this is no easy undertaking. Work and study visas in the UK are expensive. And people would either need to secure a skilled job offer from an employer who is a licensed sponsor and is willing to pay the substantial fees, or get admitted to a university or college where they can afford the international student tuition rates. There is no humanitarian visa to come to the UK.” Indeed, no such route is available to Ahmad, 35, who fled from Afghanistan to Ukraine in 2015. He had come under threat from the Taliban because his brother, Idres Bakhshi, had worked for the British army in Helmand Province and was relocated to the UK in 2014. Ahmad built a life for himself in Ukraine -– until the Russian invasion began. Unable to return to Afghanistan with the Taliban now in power, Ahmad applied to join his brother Idres, 34, who is now a British citizen living in Colchester, under the Ukraine Family Scheme. But after three months, he received a rejection letter stating that he was not eligible because neither of the brothers was related to a Ukrainian. The 35-year-old is in Hamburg, Germany, with no immigration status. He has requested temporary protection but is still waiting for a decision. He is staying with a friend of a friend but feels he has outstayed his welcome. Idres says his brother spends his days “walking around in the street, basically like a beggar”. “I work full-time,” says Idres. “I’ve been sending him money in Germany. Why should I be sending him money if he could be here, and I have a place for him to live?” he says. “I never ever thought the application would be refused. He lived in Ukraine, I’m a British citizen, I worked for the British army. I was sure it was going to be fine. When I received the refusal I couldn’t tell my brother for two days. It was so hard to tell him.” Zehrah Hasan, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, which has been supporting Idres and Mohammad, said the UK government’s “piecemeal, discriminatory” Ukrainian refugee policy had led to “heartache, destitution and fear for the many refugees left stranded”. “It cannot be right that young Nigerian students, or repeat-refugees, having already fled war in Afghanistan, have been blocked from joining family in the UK. We know that many refugees are in dire straits in mainland Europe, whereas they have the community support they need to rebuild their lives here in the UK,” she added. “It's time they end the cruel and senseless exclusions built into their refugee policies.”  This article was amended on 11 March 2024 to change the name of one individual (*) to protect their identity .

2121,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,31/12/2022,1172 words,Chris Scott,Ukrainian refugees living in UK describe 2022 as ‘perpetual hell’,"Ukrainians living in the UK have reflected on the “perpetual hell” of 2022 – which has been filled with sleepless nights checking the news – and spoken of their hopes of having their country back in 2023 and reuniting with their “patriotic” loved ones. Since Ukraine was invaded by Russia in February, the UN estimates that seven million Ukrainians have been internally displaced, while millions have fled the country to find safety elsewhere. Data from the Home Office revealed that, as of August 15 2022, more than 115,000 Ukraine Scheme visa-holders had arrived in the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme and Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme (Homes for Ukraine). The Ukraine Family Scheme allowed fleeing Ukrainians to join or accompany a UK-based family member, while the Homes for Ukraine scheme matched Ukrainians with someone in the UK willing to sponsor them and provide suitable accommodation for a minimum of six months. For Valentina Butenko, a 19-year-old student who was studying at the University of Central London at the start of the year, “2022 has been perpetual hell”. “This is probably going to sound very strange, but it’s also a year that I realised how lucky I am to be able to have things that I really love, and that I’m willing to fight for and protect,” she told the PA news agency. Ms Butenko, who has a British mother and a Ukrainian father, made the decision to return to her family home in Kyiv shortly before the war began and swapped studying for her degree for learning how to administer first aid and fire a gun. “You have this building sense of an immense responsibility to something that really matters to you and you’re afraid of losing. But you can’t quite grasp what that responsibility is,” she said. “I remember, the week before the invasion, I had a conversation with my father about what would happen and what we would do. “We both settled on the idea that if the war happened we had to stay and we had to support Ukraine. I felt we couldn’t leave.” Since the war began, Ms Butenko has worked with her father getting people to safety in the west of Ukraine or out of the country altogether, and spoke about one occasion when the pair got trapped in the middle of an aerial bombardment a few weeks into the invasion, as were moving people out of Kyiv. “The place we were staying, there was no bomb shelter and it didn’t have a basement,” Ms Butenko said. “There were air sirens. You could hear explosions happening. And I thought ‘Oh my god, if something actually falls, that’s it’. “I think it’s the helplessness for me, that’s the scariest feeling.” Despite this, she said that risking her life for her country has been worth it. “The way I dealt with the scariest moments was thinking ‘I’m doing this for Ukrainians’. “Every time I go back to Kyiv, there’s just incredible optimism. People just get on with their life and fight for it. “And I think that actually just gives such a richness to life, understanding there is nothing – no hell, no dictator and no army – that can break your willingness to live.” Ms Butenko – who flies back to the UK every few weeks to pick up supplies and medicine for people back home on the front line – added that being in the UK can sometimes be more frightening that being in Ukraine. “The one habit I kind of got into in Ukraine is that I didn’t sleep. Every few hours, I would wake up to check the news,” she said. “I needed to know, have they taken Kyiv? Do we still have a country? And I think my body’s gotten quite used to waking up every few hours. And I desperately check the news. “To be completely honest, it is much scarier for me reading about bombings sitting in London than actually being there when it’s happening.” February 24 – the day Russia invaded Ukraine – is etched into Ms Butenko’s mind. “I vividly remember waking up to something that sounded like an explosion, and I just instinctively knew ‘Oh my god, it’s begun’,” she recalled. “I looked at the news and they said that the first bombs had been dropped on Kyiv. And it was kind of a very intense sense of fear, a sense there is a possibility that I might not have a country tomorrow.” They're basically kids, but they need to be in Ukraine because it's our law. It's very tragic to see kids who need to start their life, need to make their own decisions, suffer from all the things that are going on Anna Tysovska Anna Tysovska, who worked for a beauty products company in Kyiv and fled Ukraine a few weeks after the war began, also spoke about her memories of the day Russia invaded. “Until I heard the first bombing, I couldn’t believe there was going to be a war,” the 32-year-old told PA. “I was in denial for a long time.” Ms Tysovska came to the UK in April with her mother, aunt and cousin. They were forced to leave their male relatives and friends behind after Ukraine banned men aged 18-60 from leaving the country due to the war effort. “My dad is 55 and, obviously, he will not leave,” she said. “He’s really very passionate and he’s patriotic to Ukraine, but I don’t want him to fight because I know how bad things are on the front line. “My cousin, she’s 17, and finished school last year. A lot of boys, ex-classmates, can’t leave Ukraine because they are 18. “They’re basically kids, but they need to be in Ukraine, because it’s our law. It’s very tragic to see kids who need to start their life, need to make their own decisions, suffer from all the things that are going on.” Ms Tysovska and her family moved in with a host family in Cornwall in April as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. After a few months, she enrolled in a Masters programme at the local university, which she hopes can help her country from afar. “I always wanted to get my Masters in psychology,” she said. “I will hopefully write my dissertation on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and I will try to help the people of Ukraine living in the UK who suffer from PTSD. “But actually, you know, I think every Ukrainian will suffer from PTSD so I would like to help in any way I can.” She added that she wants to go “home”, despite loving the UK. “I want to go back to Ukraine. I want to build my future there. I want to help to rebuild my country.” As for Ms Butenko, she has one big hope for 2023. “I want us to win this war,” she said. “And I really mean win. I don’t just mean I want this war to end – I want us to win this war, and claim back all our territory. Because a lot of us, a lot of Ukrainians, have sacrificed a lot for this.” Ms Tysovska said: “My hope for next year is first of all (Russian President Vladimir) Putin will die. Then we will celebrate our victory in the Khreshchatyk Street (the main street in Kyiv).” She also hopes to celebrate a milestone back in Ukraine. “I want to celebrate my birthday next year in Ukrainian Crimea,” she said. “I want everyone to have their country back. I want Russia to repay for everything they’ve done. It can’t be repaid obviously, but that’s what I want. “And I want Ukrainian kids to live in a peaceful country. They deserve it because their childhoods were stolen.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-12,1,Conditions

More than 300 new listings have been made under the UK's sanctions regimes, targeting those well-connected with Russia's leader. An update to the Gov.uk website on Tuesday said that 350 new listings had been made under the Russia sanctions regime. The Foreign Office later said Ms Truss was to announce more than 370 ""Russian and Belarussian sanctions"", bringing the total number of individuals, entities, and subsidiaries put under strict measures to over 1,000 since the invasion of Ukraine began. It is understood the new additions will bring the UK in line with restrictive measures already announced by the European Union and by other allies. The list of those sanctioned has been expanded to include a further 51 Russian oligarchs and their families, plus a raft of politicians and ""propagandists"". These include Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and former President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev. Vladimir Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova are also on the list, as is internet 'troll farm', the Internet Research Agency. Russian oligarchs now subject to UK sanctions include Mikhail Fridman, Pyotr Aven, and German Khan. The Foreign Office said the oligarchs sanctioned on Tuesday have a combined estimated worth of more than £100 billion. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin - from major oligarchs, to his Prime Minister, and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation. We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia's crimes in Ukraine. ""Working closely with our allies, we will keep increasing the pressure on Putin and cut off funding for the Russian war machine."" Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he welcomed Western sanctions but they ""are not enough"" to end the Russian aggression, calling for a full trade embargo. Boris Johnson, who was hosting a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force nations in London which was addressed by Mr Zelensky via video-link, said: ""I hear your point very loud and clear about the economic sanctions that we need to tighten, where we need to go harder on the banks, on Swift."" Further general economic sanctions were also announced on Tuesday, with the export of high-end luxury products to Russia being banned and import tariffs hiked on hundreds of goods, including vodka. But Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: ""This is shutting the door after the private jet has bolted. The Government has finally got their act together - but we should have been in this position weeks ago. This delay has given Putin's cronies a priceless window to fire-sale their assets. ""Now we need to go further. There are still too many associates of Putin getting away with it as we speak. ""The fix to sanctions legislation is good news - but it means we can merely copy what our allies do. Liz Truss should bring proposals to Parliament to strengthen the legislation even further, so we can truly lead the way in clamping down on Kremlin-linked oligarchs."" It comes as the Home Office said 4,600 visas had been issued so far under the Ukraine Family Scheme, while nearly 90,000 British households had put themselves forward to take in Ukrainian refugees. Some 88,712 households had registered for the Homes for Ukraine scheme by Tuesday morning, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said. Earlier, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said he was ""actually quite proud"" the website allowing Britons to volunteer had crashed within the first few minutes of going live on Monday. He said he was ""glad the website crashed, because it is a reflection of that generosity of the British people"".

With hosts facing increased pressure from the rising cost of living , many local authorities are worried that Ukrainian families will be left homeless when the initial six-month arrangements end. Refugees, hosts and councillors are also concerned about how Ukrainians will find independent accommodation in an increasingly competitive rental market.  In a snapshot survey of 64 councils, 61 per cent told The Independent that they were worried about an increasing number of Ukrainians presenting as homeless or being at risk of homelessness in the coming months. That was compared to 14 per cent who weren’t worried, and 25 per cent that didn’t respond.  Have you been involved in the Ukraine scheme? If so email holly.bancroft@independent.co.uk  The Homes for Ukraine scheme was launched on 14 March meaning the first refugees to arrive will reach the six-month mark during September.  Twenty-five per cent of sponsors said they only want to provide accommodation for six months or less, according to an ONS survey of 17,702 hosts. There are currently 86,100 Ukrainians in the UK under the scheme, 48,798 of which had arrived by the end of April.  “We’re going to see building pressures over the next few months and the government actually has no plan. There is zero plan or guidance coming out from the government,” Cllr Nesil Caliskan, leader of Enfield council, told The Independent. “If we waited for the government to act we would get to six months and we’d risk having loads of people homeless. So that’s why we’re planning our support now.” Cllr Caliskan said a “big concern” was the affordability and availability of private sector rentals, making it very hard for Ukrainian families to find accommodation. Cllr James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association which represents councils, urged the government to provide clarity on what happens next. “Councils, sponsors and Ukrainian guests all need to know what the options are at the end of the six-month initial placement period so they can start planning now.”  “There is a significant risk that -even if rematching is available -many Ukrainian families may need to present as homeless because of a lack of sponsors or other options,” he said. As of 29 July, 1335 households had presented as homeless to councils -635 of those were on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Analysis by Barnados, Labour and the Lib Dems predicts that between 15,000 and 21,000 Ukrainians could be homeless by winter, rising to more than 50,000 by the middle of next year. “Homes for Ukraine is a really strong scheme but the crisis point now is if we can’t get the refugees into independent housing,” Simone Schehtman, the lead pairer of Ukrainian refugees and hosts in Birmingham, said. “You go to the estate agent to try and get on the property ladder and the computer will just say no; you will fail the credit check and you won’t have a guarantor.” She urged ministers to allow local authorities to become guarantors of refugee’s rent and warned that if a plan was not put in place soon “six months of hard graft and good will by the British public and the government will become meaningless because we will have a haemorrhaging of homelessness”.  Alistair Carmichael MP, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said it would be “a tragedy” if any refugees were forced onto the streets, adding: “Ministers must act now.” Responding to the concerns, a government spokesperson said they disagreed that there was no plan for the future of the scheme. “The vast majority of sponsors want to provide support for longer than six months and we are working closely with councils to ensure all those who have fled Putin’s war have a safe place to live,” they said.  They emphasised that sponsors will continue to receive monthly £350 “thank you” payments for up to 12 months.  Inna Sukhoraba and her 16-year-old daughter Irynka are being sponsored by a host in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and have had trouble finding a place to rent for when their placement ends. Their host, Pilar, told The Independent: “Inna had found a place and was happy to pay six months rent in advance but then suddenly two days later the landlord decided to take somebody else. “It is very difficult for the Ukrainians who want to be independent and build their lives here. The government needs to give them support to move forward because they cannot be permanent guests. Where we live the rent is very expensive and one day flats come on the market, the next day they are gone. “As hosts, we feel that we have been sort of abandoned. They don’t have a plan for us or our guests and we are totally stuck.” Svitlana Stadnyk, who volunteers as a mediator between hosts and Ukrainians in partnerships with National Family Mediation, said she expected to see more cases in the coming months. “As the autumn comes, and as the six-month end approaches, there will be more and more people who need help resolving conflicts,” she said. “There are varying sources of tension and one is the rising cost of living. “Many hosts did not receive their thank you payments in time and they are seeing their utility prices go up going into the winter.” The government provides councils with a £10,500 support fund for each refugee on the Homes for Ukraine scheme, however, they have not yet committed to continuing the payments past 12 months -leaving local authorities unsure where the money will come from after the first year. Barnsley metropolitan borough council said it was worried about the six-month deadline, primarily due to lack of affordable, available accommodation, while Hampshire County Council said it was seeing “increasing pressure” on its services due to the number of arrangements coming to an end. East Suffolk Council said that it was concerned that the six-month mark would come at a time when families were facing challenges managing the increased cost of living, while Tandrige District council said it was worried its homeless prevention service would not be able to cope with the increased demand. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up said: “In the minority of cases where family or sponsor relationships break down, councils have a duty to ensure families are not left without a roof over their head. “All arrivals have access to benefits from day one and we are giving councils an extra £10,500 per person to cover any extra costs.”  ‘I simply could not survive the third night’  On the third night of the war, Inna decided she and her daughter Irynka need to leave. They had been staying with Inna’s parents in Berdychiv, Zhytomyr region and sat listening to the Russian planes flying over their home, petrified that bombs would fall on them.  “The first two nights Russian planes were flying over us and we didn’t know if they were going to drop bombs on us or not. I realised I simply could not survive the third night, so my daughter and I got on the train to Poland,” she said. While in Poland, she and her daughter found a placement under the Homes for Ukraine scheme but they always knew it would just be for six months. “I like British people and British culture and I am afraid to go back to Ukraine,” she told The Independent. Now, four months into the arrangement, she is trying to find a place where she can live independently. “I was a project manager for the Bank of Ukraine but now it is difficult for me here. For example, I found accommodation for my daughter and I and the first landlord agreed that we could rent the place but then something changed and she changed her mind.” “Where we live rent is very expensive to start with,” her host Pilar said. “The flats they are looking for, one day it comes on the market, the next it is gone.” “The Thank you payments that the government gives to the host, why can’t they give that to the Ukrainians who want to be independent?” she suggested. Inna is keen to find work in the UK but has struggled due to the language barrier. “I’m working on improving my English and I’m starting a business,” she said. “When I arrived in the UK, British people told me they liked my Ukrainian style and so I thought I could make Ukrainian dresses and sell them here.” She is financially supporting her sister and her parents back home in Ukraine and still has to pay for the utilities at her Kyiv flat. She is hoping that she will be able to support herself by selling clothes and went to her first market last week. “The main goal for my business is to support the Ukrainian economy, as well as preserve and spread our culture while I am abroad.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-09,1,Policy

As he makes his appeal, charities are calling for the Home Office’s “broken” family reunion system to be fixed. The air force lieutenant, who was granted asylum in the UK after a five-month-long campaign by The Independent, is waiting for his young family, including his wife, who are currently in Iran. He is worried that they will be forced to return to Afghanistan as their visas have run out in Iran. His story is one of thousands, it has emerged, with figures from summer 2023 showing that more than 11,000 people were then waiting to be reunited with family members in the UK. The Home Office has repeatedly refused to provide an updated figure for the visa backlog through freedom of information laws.  Charities Refugee Council and Safe Passage have called on the government to “fix and expand the UK’s broken family reunion system” in a new report, which draws on the many cases of separated refugee families that they are supporting.  The Afghan pilot said of his family: “They have been waiting for a visa for five months in Iran, but so far there is no news from the embassy and there is no guarantee it will be issued. My family are facing a lot of problems. They don’t have a proper place to live, and don’t have access to a doctor, because they are living illegally. Their Iranian visas have expired and they need to extend them, but it is impossible.  “My wife is suffering mentally and emotionally, and she is completely [without hope].” Under current rules, separated refugee children in the UK do not have the right to bring their parents into the country. Afghans evacuated from Kabul during Operation Pitting in August 2021 are also not allowed to bring their close family to the UK, and Ukrainian refugees in the UK are not able to sponsor family members to join them either.  Even those who have been granted the right to resettle in the UK can often find themselves waiting years to be relocated. And many thousands who apply for a family reunification visa are forced to wait months for a decision, despite the Home Office promising to process applications within 12 weeks.  One young unaccompanied Afghan child supported by Safe Passage, Ahmad, tried to join his older brother in the UK. His father had been killed by the Taliban and his mother was also dead but the Home Office did not accept that there were any “serious and compelling” circumstances that would necessitate a relocation to the UK.  His family reunion case was only successful after a UK judge ordered the Home Office to help.  Afghans who were evacuated to the UK during Operation Pitting are also struggling to be reunited with family members. Despite ministers promising in October 2023 that a new route would allow them to bring close family to safety, the pathway has not yet been set up.  Farhad, a teenager who was airlifted from Kabul without his parents, told The Independent: “They promised in 2021 that they’re going to bring the families, but it’s still been almost three years. “My mum and my siblings are in Pakistan because they needed a doctor and medication. But my father couldn’t get the visa to go with them. I am doing my GCSEs this month and I can’t really focus on my studies knowing that my family is struggling.” MPs and Lords wrote to the Home Office last week, calling on the government to act faster to reunite Afghan families.  Dr Wanda Wyporska, CEO at Safe Passage International, said: “Nearly three years on, it’s a national shame that Afghans, who risked so much to support UK military operations, are still waiting for a way to bring their family to safety here with them. Their family members are living in fear every day of the Taliban.” Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “The UK has clearly failed the Afghan refugees that it promised to protect, by keeping families separated for so long with no information on how they may be reunited.  “After risking everything for the UK, Afghans and their families should not be forced to make dangerous boat journeys to get here, nor should they face hostile, inhumane policies like the Rwanda plan when they do make it to the UK.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We made one of the largest commitments of any country to support people from Afghanistan, and so far we have brought around 27,900 individuals to safety in the UK, including thousands under our Afghan resettlement schemes. “In October we committed to establish a route for those evacuated from Afghanistan under Pathway 1 of the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme without their immediate family members, to reunite them in the UK. We remain on track to meet that commitment and open the route for referrals in the first half of this year.”",Broadsheet,0,2024-05,0,Policy

In a new interview with Maria Shriver for Conversations Above the Noise , Kunis said: ""People were like, 'Oh, you're so Eastern European.' I was like, 'I'm so LA! What do you mean?' Like, my whole life I was like, 'I am LA through and through.'"" Kunis said that because she identified so strongly as an American, for a long time, being Ukrainian felt ""irrelevant"" to her, despite having close friends in the country and visiting it with her husband, the actor Ashton Kutcher. She said that whenever people would ask her where she was from, she'd say she was Russian for ""a multitude of reasons"". Kunis continued: ""One of them being when I came to the States and I would tell people I'm from Ukraine, the first question I'd get was, 'Where is Ukraine?' And then I'd have to explain Ukraine and where it is on the map, and I was like, 'Ugh, that's exhausting.'"" She soon realised that if she said she was from Russia , people would know where she meant. ""I was like, great, I'll just tell people from Russia,"" she said. Kunis said everything changed for her when Russia invaded Ukraine last month. ""This happens and I can't express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, 'Oh my God, I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,'"" she said. ""It was the weirdest feeling."" She said she will no longer be telling people she's from Russia. ""Hell no, I'm from Ukraine!"" she said. Kunis and Kutcher have raised over £13m to aid victims of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

3044,urc_theindependent_raw3.docx,The Independent,5/4/2022,725 words,Via AP news wire,Harvard students' site helping Ukraine refugees find housing," Two Harvard University freshmen have launched a website designed to connect people fleeing Ukraine to those in safer countries willing to take them in - and it's generating offers of help and housing worldwide. Moved by the plight of Ukrainian refugees desperate to escape Russian bombardment across the former Soviet republic, Marco Burstein, 18, of Los Angeles , and Avi Schiffman, 19, of Seattle , used their coding skills to create UkraineTakeShelter.com over three frenzied days in early March. Since then, more than 18,000 prospective hosts have signed up on the site to offer assistance to refugees seeking matches with hosts in their preferred or convenient locations. On a recent day, Burstein and Schiffman logged 800,000 users. ""We've heard all sorts of amazing stories of hosts and refugees getting connected all over the world,"" Burstein said in an interview on the Harvard campus. ""We have hosts in almost any country you can imagine from Hungary and Romania and Poland to Canada to Australia. And we've been really blown away by the response."" Five weeks into the invasion that has left thousands dead on both sides, the number of Ukrainians fleeing the country topped a staggering 4 million, half of them children, according to the United Nations. Schiffman, who's been taking a semester off to work on several projects, said from Miami he was inspired to use his internet activism to help after attending a pro-Ukraine rally in San Diego. ""I felt that I could really do something on a more global scale here,"" he said. ""Ukraine Take Shelter puts the power back into the hands of the refugee ... they're able to take the initiative and find the listings and get in contact with hosts by themselves instead of having to freeze on a curb in Eastern Europe in the wintertime."" Among those who have taken in refugees through the website is Rickard Mijarov, a resident of the southwestern Swedish city of Linkoping who's sharing his home with 45-year-old Ukrainian evacuee Oksana Frantseva, her 18-year-old daughter and their cat. Mijarov and his wife signed up at an embassy indicating they'd help, but then stumbled upon the Harvard students' site and registered there as well. ""The next morning, I had a message from Oksana asking if we had place for them,"" he said in an interview via Zoom. ""It became reality quite fast."" ""I was surprised how quickly Rickard answered to me,"" Frantseva said in halting English. Five days later, she, her daughter and their pet were at the front door. Burstein and Schiffman designed the platform with combat refugees' particular concerns in mind. They worked to make it as easy to use as possible so someone in immediate danger can enter their location and see the offers of help that are closest to them. On the hosting side, they also gave prospective hosts the opportunity to indicate what languages they speak; how many refugees they can accommodate; and any restrictions on taking in young children or pets. To help avoid human trafficking and other hazards that vulnerable refugees face, the platform encourages evacuees to ask hosts to provide their full names and social media profiles, and request a video call to show what accommodations they're offering. ""We know that this is potentially a dangerous situation, so we have a lot of steps in place to ensure the protection of our refugees,"" Burstein said. ""We have a detailed guide that we give to all refugees to help them verify the host that they're talking to - make sure that the person that they may be speaking with on the phone is the same one that they're meeting up with in person."" The two students say they're trying to arrange a meeting with officials from the U.N. refugee agency, and they are also looking to work with Airbnb, Vrbo and other online vacation rental companies. So far, they've borne all the expenses - a hardship for college students - for web hosting and Google Translate costs. But they're determined to continue as long as possible and are looking into registering as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit so they can apply for grants.

1832,urc_theindependent_raw1.docx,The Independent,10/3/2022,1105 words,May Bulman,'Mean-spirited' UK under growing pressure to waive visas for Ukrainian refugees,"The Ukrainian ambassador has urged the British government to temporarily lift all visa requirements for those fleeing his country, with pressure increasing on ministers to act over a system that has been heavily criticised.  Around 850 people have so far been issued a visa under the Home Office 's family migration scheme, announced on Friday - despite tens of thousands with family links to the UK applying. Vadym Prystaiko said that if bureaucratic procedures were ""simplified"" it would ""definitely resolve all the issues"". He told the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday: ""I don't expect many of them to come. I don't want to see these pictures of people banging at the doors in Calais and scratching the doors which are quite sealed."" Campaigners have accused the UK of ""lagging behind"" other European countries over its response to the Ukraine refugee crisis by welcoming a ""pitiful"" number of refugees in the first two weeks of the war. The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman called for ""immediate action"" to enable refugees to get their cases dealt with swiftly by removing ""unnecessary delays and bureaucracy"" in the visa application process.  The Independent has set up a petition calling on the UK government to be at the forefront of the international community offering aid and support to those in Ukraine. To sign the petition click here .  Ombudsman Rob Behrens said: ""It is vital the Home Office acts to correct failings in its handling of visa applications, especially failings we have previously reported and which we are seeing repeated here. ""In this horrendous situation swift action is needed to make sure the process of getting a visa is simple, accessible and quick. Lives depend on it."" Hundreds of Ukrainians have arrived in the French port town of Calais since the Russian invasion began in the hope of reaching their loved ones in Britain, but have not been allowed to apply to the scheme from there. Confusion arose on Wednesday after the Home Office announced that a temporary visa centre in Lille - some 70 miles away - which was initially thought to be a facility where Ukrainian refugees could travel to submit their visa applications, would only work on a referral basis. The department was also accused of telling ""outright lies"" after The Independent revealed that a Home Office official had wrongly claimed that Ukrainian refugees in Calais could obtain free Eurostar tickets to travel to a UK visa centre in Lille - when in fact this route does not exist. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees grappled with the ""unbearable"" UK visa application process in other European countries, which has seen many forced to wait for hours in the cold and travel for miles. Refugees who attended a UK visa centre in Poland to submit applications to join relatives in the UK were told that they must travel 170 miles across the country in order to complete the process, prompting those going through the process to describe it as ""unbearable"". Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, described the government's approach to helping Ukrainian people as ""mean spirited"" and accused Britain of ""lagging behind our European neighbours"" in its response. ""The government's family visa scheme is extremely limited and restricted, with visas granted to hundreds of people - a pitiful number, and a fraction of the need and application numbers,"" he said. ""The government needs to urgently waive visa requirements to enable Ukrainians to travel to the UK more easily and then grant them refugee protection as quickly as possible after arrival."" Sonya Sceats, chief executive at Freedom from Torture, echoed his remarks, saying: ""This government's pitiful response to the plight of Ukrainian refugees shames Britain. ""Not only are these failing visa-based schemes causing intolerable heartbreak for Ukrainians blocked from reaching safety here by all the red tape. It is time for the prime minister to listen to the British people and abandon his insistence on visas for Ukrainian refugees."" The government's approach to the crisis came under further criticism after it emerged that home secretary Priti Patel told the Irish government she was concerned that the country's welcoming policy towards Ukrainian refugees would allow them to reach the UK by the back door. An anonymous briefing from a UK government source on Tuesday suggested that Ukrainian criminals or drug dealers could take advantage of the Anglo-Irish common travel area to gain access to mainland Britain - a suggestion was labelled as ""disgraceful"" and ""absolutely terrible"" by members of the Irish parliament. It comes after the government faced a barrage of criticism from Tory MPs over its response, with ministers accused by its own backbenchers of showing ""too little compassion"" and urged to ""get a grip"". David Cameron suggested on Wednesday that the UK should be more generous towards Ukrainian refugees, telling LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr: ""I hope [refugees minister Richard Harrington] is allowed if we want to go for shorter visas, or it's just Ukrainian passports, and perhaps something else, let's find a way to get it done."" Mike Adamson, chief executive at British Red Cross, said:â¯""Right now, as countries across Europe have done, the UK government must waive visa requirements for those fleeing Ukraine. Securityâ¯checksâ¯can still be carried out when people travel or arrive in the UK."" A government spokesperson said: ""The UK stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the people of Ukraine and we have taken urgent action to process visas at speed for all those eligible to the Ukraine family scheme, while carrying out vital security checks. ""We have protected appointments at all of our visa application centres to ensure there is sufficient capacity and deployed extra staff to help people through the process as quickly as possible.""

Families looking to sponsor Ukrainian families under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have experienced delays because family members' visas are coming through at different times, with others not getting them at all. A vigil took place outside the Home Office in central London on Saturday afternoon, with attendees telling of their frustrations over a lack of information from the Government. Among those attending were Vladymir Tymashov, 35, and his wife Katryna, originally from Dnipro in eastern Ukraine, now living in Wimbledon, south-west London, who are trying to host a young mother and her two young children. The couple, who themselves have two children, told the PA news agency they applied for the scheme in March, but the family has been halted because the youngest child's visa has been delayed. Mr Tymashov said: ""The frustrating part is the mother and the eldest child received their visas and the younger child still has no feedback. ""It's frustrating, it makes us feel uncertain that we did everything right, we tried to call the Home Office but they're just saying they're trying. ""The family hoped for a quicker outcome so they are a little bit concerned and unclear about their future, they're in Poland at the moment and are waiting to come here. ""I would love the Government to speed up, maybe they need to get rid of the checks for the younger kids, some of them are a bit ridiculous."" Government figures released this week show that around 71,800 visas have been issued to Ukrainians under the Family and Sponsorship schemes, but less than a third have arrived in the UK. The vigil saw dozens of people, would-be sponsors and supporters, holding banners calling for the Government to speed up delays and improve the application process. The group intends to maintain a presence outside the Home Office every day between 2-4pm until the delays are resolved. Another, named Lucy Wells, 34, from Blandford, in Dorset, said her family applied on March 23 to sponsor two mothers and four children, aged 15 to three, from Kyiv. She said: ""I'm here today because it's been a really frustrating process and we're still waiting on visas but have been met by so many obstacles along the way. ""One of the most shocking things that we found out is on Monday we finally got an email from someone at the Home Office, who told us that the visas had been issued. ""We've only received two visa emails, so we were waiting on notification of four visas."" The refugees, have been in accommodation in Germany for a month, Ms Wells said. She added: ""It's really like they've been stuck in limbo, they're trying to adapt to something that's completely abnormal. ""They're really struggling financially and it's really difficult for them-it's really frustrating and upsetting. ""We really want to work with the family but we're getting no answers, every day feels like a second job."" A Government spokesman said: ""The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.""",Broadsheet,0,2022-04,1,Migration

Uwandu Michael, originally from Nigeria , said he was ""really shocked"" when he realised he had been sent to a hotel around 70 miles away from other Ukrainian refugees when they were bussed out of Calais this week. The 37-year-old, who moved to Ukraine in 2009 and secured permanent residency eight years ago, said he was granted Ukrainian citizenship in late February but had to flee before he could collect his passport. As he attempted to travel across the border into Poland , he became separated from his Ukrainian ex-partner and nine-year-old daughter and has not been able to contact them since. Hoping to join his sister and cousin in London, he made his way alone to Calais, where he was helped to apply online for a visa by a charity. The majority of Ukrainians who had gathered at the port town were taken to hotels near Lille on Wednesday, close to where a pop-up visa centre is being set up, or nearer to existing centres in Paris or Brussels. But Uwandu Michael and around five other people of colour with UK relatives were taken to a hotel on a remote industrial estate near Boulogne-sur-Mer. We are alone -nobody is talking to us Uwandu Michael, a refugee from Ukraine They say they have been given no information about why they were separated and are unclear which authorities put them into the mini van. They have received no update about their visa applications or had any help from officials since they arrived. The 37-year-old told the PA news agency he feels ""tired of life, traumatised, and confused"". He suspects they may have been treated differently because of the colour of their skin, adding: ""We are alone - nobody is talking to us"". He said: ""It's like all the stress, everything is beginning again to multiply. ""I think we don't have anybody to speak to, except you... We cannot continue to be living in this kind of tense condition, coupled with what we've seen in Ukraine."" Uwandu Michael said he is desperate to reach the people who love him so they can ""heal my wounds"", and urged the UK Government to speed up the visa process. He said: ""I just want them to help us, because our situation here, we lost a lot of things... and putting me here is actually making me go crazy."" He also described experiencing discrimination when trying to get a train from Lviv, with Ukrainian women and children given priority over people of colour, including his daughter who is mixed race. He said he believes he was able to get to Poland because a journalist tipped him off that a train was leaving on another platform that most people were not aware of. Another refugee, Kevin , originally from Kenya, was three months away from completing his computer science university course in western Ukraine, where he had a temporary residence permit, when the country was invaded. He wants to continue his studies in England and join his uncle in Northampton. He believes the group were separated from the other refugees because they are not Ukrainian, which has left him feeling ""awful, neglected, angry"". He said: ""It's pretty awful, it makes us feel like we're left out. ""But all we're doing is just escaping the war and hoping for the best for ourselves."" Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said the charity had initially understood that people living in Ukraine who were not Ukrainian nationals would be eligible under the current scheme if they had loved ones in the UK. Home Office guidance says applicants must be joining UK-based family members, be Ukrainian or have an immediate relative who is a Ukrainian national who is applying to the scheme, and have been residing in the country on or immediately before January 1 2022. Her biggest fear now is what will happen to people ""who for one reason or another are at the edges of the scheme, who don't quite qualify who do have family in the UK"". Ms Moseley said the group near Boulogne-sur-Mer are ""very scared"" due to the lack of certainty. They speak English and several are students who would like to continue learning in England, but have been ""repeatedly"" asked to apply for asylum in France. She said: ""If they've got close family relations in the UK who are willing to support them, then it doesn't make any sense for them to live in France where they don't know anyone."" Asked if she believed racism may have played a part in the decision to move them to a separate location, she said: ""It's a very big coincidence that the nationality of these people is basically Kenyan, Nigerian and Yemeni. ""And it seems extremely coincidental that all the people that have been taken elsewhere are these nationalities."" Details of a separate visa route, allowing UK individuals and companies to sponsor people from Ukraine to come to the country, and who will be eligible, are due to be set out next week. A Government spokesman said: ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukrainians which is why we've made it easier for those with Ukrainian passports to come here. ""This is alongside changes to visas to ensure Ukrainians in the UK can stay here. ""We have expanded our Visa Application Capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here. ""This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need.""

Steve Dury from Langport, Somerset, was only able to accommodate two mothers and three children from Kharkiv , Ukraine, when his ""desperate plea"" led the Home Secretary's office to intervene and see to the approval of the group's final visa application for three-year-old Egor Svichkar. Having applied for the scheme when it first opened on March 18, Egor's four relatives had been staying in Warsaw and acquired their visas by the beginning of April, but a further delay left them waiting on Egor's document until Monday. Mr Dury said the group were met with an ""impregnable wall of bureaucracy"" during the process and they considered returning to Kharkiv - a city still enduring shelling from Russian forces. ""It's been a diabolical process,"" the local government officer, 59, told the PA news agency. ""They were actively discussing (going back to Ukraine) and were so dejected by the whole thing - which is heartbreaking to think that they were going to return to a warzone because they had given up hope of ever coming to the UK. ""They're already traumatised, they spent days in the basement listening to the bombing around them, not knowing if their apartment was going to collapse on top of them... this (added) to their trauma."" The group, who arrived at Bristol airport on Tuesday, includes Liudmyla Tarasenko and her 15-year-old daughter, Daria, and Liudmyla's 27-year-old niece and Egor's mother, Yulia Svichkar - as well as 13-year-old Denys Chemodanov, whose mother is related to the family and authorised the women to take him with them. They were hoping to have the approval of Egor's visa through on Friday April 1, but ""lost all hope"" when the centre in Warsaw made an administrative error - setting the application back by a week and a half. Mr Dury paid more than £1,000 to keep the five of them housed in the Polish capital but was growing increasingly concerned for their wellbeing when Egor fell ill. He said he felt ""sheer relief"" and ""joy"" when the toddler's visa came through, but that they ""would have gotten nowhere"" without his emailing Home Secretary Priti Patel.  Mr Dury wrote to Ms Patel's office on Sunday: ""This dreadful 'Homes for Ukrainians' visa system is taking its toll. ""My family (is) in floods of tears today, just messaged me: 'What kind of hell is this?' ""(They) are about to give up hope of coming to UK, and return to Ukraine, where they have no accommodation (and) no money."" Mr Dury received a reply on Monday after a message from Ms Patel's email address asked that the case be ""followed up"". A Home Office staff member wrote back: ""Please pass on our apologies to the family for the delays in processing Egor's visa application."" ""Egor's visa was processed by caseworkers in Sheffield over the weekend and an instruction has now been sent to Warsaw to print the visa."" Mr Dury said it should not take ""high-level intervention"" to ensure refugees are allowed to come to the UK. ""I think without my desperate plea to Priti Patel's email, we'd still be waiting... We seemed to be banging our heads against a brick wall,"" he said. ""And whilst I'm glad that (the Home Office) did step in... I'm more annoyed at the very long waits and the anxiety that it's caused, particularly the Ukrainian family. ""Whether they'd ever get a visa, how long it was taking, the length of time they were staying in Warsaw. The little boy went down with a sickness because he got cold and wet. ""So I think their anxiety levels were sky-high as a result of this interminably long process... It should never have reached that stage."" It seems that this is designed to deter people from coming here. Steve Dury Mr Dury described the ""mental torment"" the group has been put through. ""We've been through the wringer for the last four weeks,"" he said. ""Deeply frustrating, full of anxiety and concerned - those are the main emotions. ""I almost feel partly responsible for leading them to believe the Government line that this would be a quick process."" Mr Dury also added the system feels ""designed to deter"" Ukrainians from coming to the UK. ""I know there are many, many, many others still waiting for their visas,"" he said. ""And I don't think Priti Patel is going to respond to every single person who's waiting and anxious at the moment. ""It seems that this is designed to deter people from coming here."" A Government spokesperson said: ""We continue to process visas for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as quickly as possible, but accept progress has not been quick enough.

2708,urc_theindependent_raw2.docx,The Independent,29/9/2022,543 words,Karel Janicek,Czechs relaunch checks at Slovak border amid migration wave," Czech police fired warning shots in the air before detaining the driver of a van carrying 15 migrants Thursday morning after the Czech Republic and Austria renewed checks at the border with Slovakia amid a new wave of migration. Czech police reported traffic delays, especially for trucks, after the measure became effective on Thursday at 27 border crossings, while the Austrian authorities enforced it at 11 crossings.  The checks will be initially in place for 10 days. Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia all belong to the European Union’s visa-free Schengen zone, where residents of member nations typically can cross borders without presenting passports or visas. Schengen countries have adopted temporary border controls in the past for various reasons, including to curb illegal migration and to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In the first eight hours of the checks, the Czech police said some 120 illegal migrants, including the 15 in the van, were detained on Czech territory, together with nine human smugglers. “The goal isn’t to complicate the lives of the Czech and Slovak citizens,” Czech Interior Minister Vit Rakusan said after midnight at a border crossing. “The goal is only to make it clear to the groups of smugglers, who are the real criminals … that they have a barrier at the border.”  He spoke after Slovakia’s Prime Minister Eduard Heger criticized the move of its neighbor. Until 1992, they were one country, Czechoslovakia.  Rakusan said Czech officials will negotiate further steps with the authorities from other European countries. He said the Czech Republic, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency “will do the maximum to find a Europe-wide solution.” Slovakia wants to help enforce the outer Schengen border between Hungary and Serbia to curb the flow of migrants. Interior Minister Roman Mikulec said if the talks with neighboring countries don’t result in a solution, his country will also launch border checks. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the Czech Republic accepted some 430,000 Ukrainian refugees but Rakusan said the latest measure is dealing with illegal migration. The Interior Ministry said the checks were necessary after authorities detained almost 12,000 migrants on Czech territory this year, most of them from Syria. That is more than the 8,500 seen during the previous massive migration wave in Europe in 2015, when the Czech Republic was not on the main route. Some 125 human smugglers have been arrested this year, a significant increase compared with the previous years. The ministry said that the migrants have been using the Czech Republic as a transit country on their way mostly from Turkey to the West and don’t apply for asylum in the country. Rakusan said that after his talks with German officials, “there’s, of course a threat” that neighboring Germany, a key trade partner for his country, will also start checks on the border with the Czech Republic.  “We do all we can to prevent that,” he said. The Czech Republic, together with Hungary and Poland, refused to comply with a refugee quota program launched by the EU after well over a million migrants entered the bloc in 2015, most fleeing war in Syria and Iraq. ___ Follow all AP stories on migration at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",Broadsheet,0,2022-09,0,Policy

Refugees who have fled Vladimir Putin’s deadly invasion have shared their hopes for a more peaceful 2023 as the conflict heads toward its first anniversary in February.  Despite usually celebrating Christmas on January 7 – as determined by the Orthodox Church – Kateryna Chebizhak, 34, who works as a telephone interpreter, and her seven-year-old son Kolya, are planning on spending December 25 with friends who live near them in Enfield , North London. “We have friends here that live just next door and we will meet to celebrate”, Ms Chebizhak said. “I have some presents for Kolya and we will have a nice walk, we might do some arts and crafts and play Uno.” The pair came to the UK in April after fleeing Kyiv , following short stays in Poland and Germany. She added that when she told her son that in the UK children usually receive Christmas presents on December 25, he began making a list. “Usually in Ukraine, we just get presents under the Christmas Tree in the New Year, but [in the UK] it works differently”, she said. “Now’s he waiting for his two presents and he’s really excited. As it is the school holidays, he has been writing letters to Santa Claus.” This time of the year is also tainted with sadness since Ms Chebizhak would usually spend Christmas with her family back in Ukraine, of which the exact location details cannot be mentioned for safety reasons. “Usually we have traditions where my mum (Tetiana) will always make 12 dishes which symbolise the 12 months of the year and we would make a wish on Christmas Eve and go to bed and it should come true”, she said. Ms Chebizhak added that her parents are okay, but that her mother did not put up a Christmas tree due to the ongoing war. “My sister Anna also used to live not too far from them and she also left to go to Greece with her two children, so they are alone and she doesn’t have any grandchildren nearby”, she added. “My mum and dad might sit down together and watch some movies or listen to the national anthem of Ukraine and we’ll have a call, but they are coping and doing great despite it not being a good situation.” As the pair look forward to 2023, Ms Chebizhak said she “dreams of peace in our country”.  “We really hope the war’s over and we can return to see Kolya’s dad as he misses him very much and is still in the Vinnytska region in Ukraine. Ms Chebizhak also has plans to do an interpretation and translation course to fulfill her dream of becoming a fully qualified interpreter, thanks to public donations made through a crowdfunder set up by platform Beam , which is supporting Ukrainian refugees into jobs and homes. “We are so thankful for all the kindness and support, which means I moved into my own place in November and can do my interpretation course next year”, she said. “Kolya is also looking forward to continuing with school and his football classes. We’re just trying to live a normal life.” Olha Komarnytska who lives in Birmingham with her children – Mia, 15, and Volodymyr, 13 – are also set to experience their first Christmas in the UK, alongside their host family. They arrived in the UK from western Ukraine in May of this year. “We usually celebrate Christmas in January but a think of lot of Ukrainians will celebrate Christmas in December this year because Russians celebrate Christmas in January and it’s not very good for us because we are fighting with Russia”, Ms Komarnytska, a 42-year-old cleaner said. She said that on December 25, the group are to go to Church together, followed by a Christmas dinner, which will include traditional British and Ukrainian food staples. “I plan to make cabbage with rice, meat carrot and onions and a Ukrainian salad with potato, carrot, meat, onions and cucumber,” she added.  We're so sad because we can't be with our family because my husband stayed in Ukraine and my mum, dad and brothers all stayed in Ukraine and we can't celebrate Christmas with them  Olha Komarnytska The family has already gotten into the Christmas spirit by attending a party hosted by Centrala, an art space in Birmingham dedicated to promoting Central and Eastern European art and culture, on December 19 – Saint Nicholas Day. “It was amazing and all the children there were very happy – they received a lot of presents and they saw Santa and heard Ukrainian music”, she said. “My son was sadly not at the party as he was ill but my daughter was really happy when she went.” Several people from the family will be absent from the dinner – Mrs Komarnytska’s husband Taras, her mother and father, Anna and Vasyl and brothers Dmytro and Vasyl. “We’re so sad because we can’t be with our family because my husband stayed in Ukraine and my mum, dad and brothers all stayed in Ukraine and we can’t celebrate Christmas with them”, she said, “It’s not good, we are not happy – but the situation is very bad because of the war happening in Ukraine and there is a bad situation with electricity where many don’t have any.” As for her hopes for 2023, Mrs Komarnytska said she will be “happy if I am in Ukraine”. “I want to come back to my family and spend time with my family,” she said. “It’s very important for me because my children miss their dad, grandma and grandpapa and their friends. “I think next Christmas we will celebrate in Ukraine, but we will always remember how lovely and helpful those in the UK have been to Ukrainians.”",Broadsheet,0,2022-12,1,Migration

Jane Finlay, 56, criticised the Government following difficulties she faced trying to bring over a family of four women from Ukraine to the UK on the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Ms Finlay said once she applied for the scheme there was ""no assistance"" from the Government in finding a family to house, so looked on Facebook where she connected with a woman called Nadia. Nadia, whose last name has not been given for safeguarding reasons, was looking to seek refuge in the UK along with her 16-year-old daughter, her sister-in-law and her 31-year-old niece after Russia launched a war with Ukraine on February 27. Ms Finlay told the PA news agency: ""It became very quickly apparent that the application process [of the family scheme] was the only support we were going to get from the Government. ""It's really cynical on their behalf because there's really generous members of the UK public trying to do something and the Government has done absolutely nothing apart from set this website up where we register. ""I have a degree, three of the family members are graduates, and it still took us 11 hours to fill in the forms. ""They had to provide information such as the father of the 16-year-old had to give written permission that she could leave the country, in English, but he's fighting in Ukraine, so it's a ridiculous thing to ask. Part of the questions seemed cut and pasted from another scheme as they were completely irrelevant, all the information we had to provide we had to give in PDF form, which adds another layer of complexity to people trying to stay online in a war zone. ""I know, anecdotally, this system ended up causing arguments between sponsors and the families coming because it's such a difficult process."" Once the visas were approved, Ms Finlay left her home in Cornwall and flew to Berlin on March 21. There she travelled to the border in Medyka, Poland, with her friend Pete Jones to collect Nadia and her family. The group then went to a visa processing centre in Berlin to skip the queues in Poland, as one of the family members had an expired passport and the family was travelling with two chihuahuas which required paperwork, but when they arrived Ms Finlay said the workers had not heard of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. They went to Calais after receiving notice the visas had been approved but did not receive them until the next day. Ms Finlay said she eventually travelled with the family from Calais to Folkestone on March 31 - nine days after meeting them at the border. The family has now settled with her and her partner Michael Whitehill in Cornwall. ""I'm still hearing daily of women and children in basements not able to come over because the visas haven't been processed. It's absolutely heart breaking,"" she said. ""We absolutely believe, it's the only way forward, this Government should waive the visa. So many people here in Cornwall who have voted Conservative all their lives are now they're saying they won't be voting Tory anymore because the Government's response has been shameful."" A Government spokesperson said: ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme was set up in record time but we acknowledge progress approving visas has not been good enough. The Home Office has made changes to visa processing - the application form has been streamlined, Ukrainian passport holders can now apply online and do their biometrics checks once in the UK, and greater resource has gone into the system.

A tent town built at Gormanstown Barracks, in Co Meath, will open on Monday to put up arrivals. The Defence Forces-built site can accommodate 350 people. Government leaders yesterday held an emergency meeting to discuss new measures to house refugees arriving in Ireland. A temporary accommodation centre for people fleeing war was set up at Dublin's Citywest Hotel earlier this year. However, 250 Ukrainians had to kip on the airport floor this week as Citywest is now full. Ministers last night confirmed that over 160 of these had been transferred out of the airport. Some 41,000 people have come to Ireland from Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in February. Of those, 30,000 sought accommodation assistance from the State. And in recent weeks, Ireland has seen a dramatic increase in the numbers seeking refuge here from countries other than Ukraine. In 2021, 2,648 arrivals sought international protection at the border, compared with 7,080 arrivals so far this year. Taoiseach Micheal Martin yesterday blamed the UK's ""shocking"" plan to deport some migrants to Rwanda for a surge of arrivals.

It is offering up to (EURO)135 per person a night to those who take them in. The move - announced on a government website - is designed to ease accommodation pressures. Some new arrivals have ended up sleeping on floors and chairs while many others are staying in tents. The call-out for ""expressions of interest"" comes as Defence Forces continue to examine all options, including buying up additional tents. Latest figures show more than 43,000 desperate refugees have come to Ireland after fleeing Vladimir Putin's war, launched in February. Around 1,400 are arriving each week and all the signs are that the numbers will not drop off any time soon. The Department of Children said it ""urgently needs to secure shortterm accommodation and ancillary services"" for Ukrainians, advising that ""turnkey"" options would be best. It advises via the Government Tenders site that ""short-term"" means the next six months or longer. Normal government rules around providing accommodation have been loosened to speed things up. The site calls for catered and noncatered accommodation which can hold at least 50 residents in double or triple rooms. Many hotels and B&B's came forward in March to strike deals with the Government when Ukrainian refugees began arriving. However, most of those contracts are coming to a close in August and it is not clear how many providers will agree to extend. A Department spokesperson said: ""As existing contracts reach capacity and/or expire, the department is continuing to proactively reach out and engage with the market in order to deliver additional capacity."" Department rates point to (EURO)135 paid per night for each single adult on a full-board basis in Dublin. And Tents an additional (EURO)25 would be paid for each additional spouse or child. The payments are likely to drop for properties outside the capital. Around 150 Ukrainian refugees arrived in Gormanston Army Camp, Co Meath, on Tuesday. They have been staying in around 40 military tents while more permanent accommodation was sourced. And further Defence Forces tents have opened at Knockalisheen Direct Provision Centre, Co Clare, to house 100. Meanwhile, under new rules, non- Ukrainians granted refugee status in other countries will need a visa to enter Ireland.

We can't even house Irish people adequately, so it was always going to be problematic to find places for the thousands upon thousands of Ukrainians coming here. Instead of putting them in tents, maybe those in power could think outside the box. There are hundreds of state buildings lying idle around the country that could be repurposed to house not only Ukrainians, but Irish people who can't find a decent place to live. Now the government is on holiday until sometime in OCTOBER, maybe Dail Eireann, which also lies empty, could be used to house the desperate fleeing war.

Hundreds of people fleeing the war-torn country are set to be shunted into temporary accommodation on the MS Victoria I, currently berthed in Leith, Edinburgh. But with Covid cases spreading across Scotland, a leading expert has warned the Scottish Government would be ""bloody lucky"" if there is no major virus outbreak on the vessel. Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, said: ""It's a very risky move. The number of outbreaks of Covid that happened on ships is very large. ""I would say there's a real risk that if Covid gets into that ship and there's a fairly large number of people on board, you might have quite a big outbreak. ""It's not just an issue of being on a passenger ship, it's the close proximity people have. ""The ventilation system on the ship may have something to do with it as well. ""Somebody might be in a confined space but breathing out and the air gets round. ""You can't really ask people to sit there with the doors all closed. I think they are running a very real risk."" Professor Pennington said vaccination checks, testing passengers and imposing the wearing of face masks would be the ""basic minimum"" measures to take. He also warned symptomless patients could carry the virus aboard without noticing and urged the Government not to house vulnerable people over the age of 65. Professor Pennington added: ""I suppose the main problem is that you've got these people that you've got to put somewhere. ""I think they'd be bloody lucky to avoid having the outbreak on the ship with Omicron as it is and Scotland being the number one in the UK in terms of infections."" The 190-metre-long ship can accommodate up to 2,500 passengers, and boasts more than 700 cabins. Prior to the ship's latest commission, the vessel sailed through the Baltic sea on leisure trips. Up to 10,000 Ukrainians are understood to have arrived in Scotland since Russia's invasion in February. The Scottish Government recently announced that approximately 730 of them will live aboard MS Victoria after shelving their flagship ""super sponsor scheme"". The solution is meant to be temporary while permanent housing is being made ready. Ukraine's consul general in Scotland warned Nicola Sturgeon that refugees should not be left to languish in cabins. Yevhen Mankovskyi, who is planning to inspect the ship next week, said: ""I don't want people to live for six months on the ship, no one wants this."" A Scottish Government spokesman said: ""Safeguarding the health of displaced people on the passenger ship is our priority, as it is in other temporary accommodation such as hotels.

Around 10,147 Ukrainian refugees have arrived into the State so far, according to the latest figures from the Department of Justice. Hundreds of those who have arrived are healthcare workers, including surgeons, nurses, psychologists, dentists, dermatologists and GPs. And they are preparing to write to Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, asking for urgent action so they can work for the Irish healthcare system, which is suffering a severe staffing crisis. Ukrainian couple Nikita Skakun, 34, and Mariia Peschanska, 25, are both qualified doctors who arrived in Ireland on March 14. They are just two of over 100 health workers who are desperate to start work, so that they can send wages home to fund their families and the Ukrainian army. The couple, who are currently living in the Imperial Hotel in Lisdoonvarna, Co Clare, are originally from Odessa, Ukraine. Mariia told The Irish Sun: ""We have a WhatsApp group chat for all of the Ukrainians who have arrived here, who used to work in the medical field. A guy in our hotel is a child surgeon, and there are dentists, psychiatrists, anaesthetists, orthodontists, nurses. It is a group of highly skilled people. ""We will be writing a letter to the Health Minister Stephen Donnelly, to make some sort of unified procedure for Ukrainian doctors because from what we have heard, doctors are very much needed in Ireland so we're hoping something will be done on the matter. ""For medics to work here, you need your medical diploma verified and you have to pass an exam. ""It's different to Ukraine, it won't be easy, unless the Government make a fast-tracking system."" Currently, most non-EU doctors need to take a test, known as the PRES exams, that would allow them to practise in Ireland. However, the exams only recently resumed after being put on hold due to the pandemic - and there are already hundreds of eligible medical graduates waiting to sit them. At home, Nikita and Mariia work at a private clinic in Odessa, where they specialise in dermatology. But now, their lives ""have been erased"" as Russian forces continue to wage war on their beloved country. The couple were on holiday in Sri Lanka when Ukraine was invaded by Putin's troops on February 24. Their flight home was cancelled so they were forced to fly to Germany, and then Ireland, where they are now living in Co Clare alongside hundreds of other Ukrainian refugees. Mariia said: ""When the war started, we were on holiday so we didn't know where to go. ""I feel that my whole life in Ukraine does not exist any more, every little ritual that we had, the work we have, the social network, our friends have all left, so we feel we have nothing left there. Our lives were completely erased. We flew to Germany for a week but we don't know German, so it would be very hard for us to integrate there and get jobs, so we decided to come to here. Ireland was one of the first countries to open its borders for Ukrainians, which really surprised us."" Nikita added: ""We didn't know much about it but it's so beautiful and we feel very lucky and welcome here."" Ireland is expected to take in around 200,000 Ukrainian refugees according to Ministers. And the couple said they have been blown away by the Irish hospitality they've experienced and the Government's handling of the humanitarian crisis so far. Mariia said: ""Everything is so organised, everyone here is so nice. ""We are very surprised how nice Irish people are, everyone is so welcoming, and pleasant to talk to. ""They are compassionate about the Ukraine situation. We were intimidated when we arrived, but they have supplied us with accommodation and food and we feel very grateful for that. ""It is amazing to see that people are so united to help Ukrainians and that they are so compassionate and determined. We really feel the support of the world right now."" Back home, Mariia's mother remains in the historic city of Odessa, in southern Ukraine, which is currently stable. Many of their friends and families are also still trapped in the war-torn country. Mariia said: ""My mum is in Odessa, she does not want to leave, because everything is relatively OK for now. She wants to stay there for as long as it will be safe for her. ""The first couple of weeks, we were so worried. It was very hard for me to talk to her, we would hear sirens in the background, and she was hiding in the bathroom, it was very scary."" The couple also have family living near the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk, where dozens of people have died as result of Russian shelling attacks. Nikita said: "" am trying to get them to escape to Odessa. They can live in our flat 'cos it will be safe there. But they are old and they don't want to leave. ""They are saying they are being bombed constantly, it is hard for them to leave the city, even if they want to do so."" Mariia said the couple have been racked with feelings of ""guilt"" for not being able to return to their country and help defend their homeland against the Russians. At the moment, most men aged 18 to 60 can't leave Ukraine as they must stay and join the resistance. Because they were on holiday when the war broke, however, Nikita was unable to return. But the couple vowed to do everything they can to help their country from afar. Nikita said: ""At first I thought I should go back to Ukraine, but we decided I should stay and work so that we can send money back to our parents and the military."" In a statement the Irish Medical Council said the organisation is seeking ways to ""support doctors arriving from Ukraine into Ireland."" It said it had a ""statutory responsibility to ensure that doctors who register with the Council in order to work in Ireland meet the required standards in the interest of patient safety"".

Higher Education Minister Simon Harris has announced the plan, with a temporary office set up in Longford Westmeath Education and Training Board's office in Marlinstown. The Government are seeking a permanent base for the training centre, with the old Columb Army Barracks being considered.

Another 5,000 pledges have been made through various other pipelines, including other charities. Green Party Deputy Joe O'Brien has outlined that there is a risk level associated this and said Garda vetting may be required in terms of child protection. He said: ""The Red Cross are prioritising vacant properties first and they are calling people to assess suitability. ""The risk level there would be much, much less because a person would have their own distinct building.

Early statistics suggest about 30 per cent of the pledged accommodation is 'standalone' - homes and apartments that won't be shared with other people. The rest is shared accommodation, which ranges from one room to several rooms in a house. But Deputy O'Brien admitted there are many questions ""we cannot 100 per cent answer right now"" about where people will live later on.

Ex-England coach Sven, 75, says he now has ""a year at best"" to live after being diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer last February. And he gathered loved ones from across the globe at his home in his native Sweden for a moving festive celebration which may well have been his last. A source told The Irish Sun: ""Sven was told there was basically nothing the doctors could do. ""It was obviously a huge blow to him but he was stoic about it and determined to keep it a secret for as long as possible. He didn't want any fuss. ""His focus has always been his family and staying as positive as possible during the time he has left. His children and other family members gathered at his house over Christmas for a big get-together."" Sven's close friend and agent Anders Runebjer told The Irish Sun last night: ""Sven had a party for his family at Christmas time. It was a full house. ""His children were there, his brother and father, his new woman, her sister and her kids and his sixyear-old granddaughter Sky. ""It was a happy event considering the situation and there were many smiles - there are always smiles around Sven."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last night expressed his sympathies after hearing the www.news.No 10 said in a statement: ""The Prime Minister's thoughts are with him and his family."" Sven has two children from his marriage to Ann-Christine Pettersson from 1977-94 - Johan and Lina, who are both in their 40s. Johan, a football agent who lives in Spain, and daughter Lina, who works for the Red Cross caring for Ukrainian refugees, both flew back to Sweden for the get-together. The devoted pair gathered with other family members at his stunning waterside retreat at Sunne on Lake Fryken. Specialists told him they could not treat his cancer but chemotherapy is understood to have reduced the size of his tumour, possibly prolonging his life. Silver-tongued Sven was in charge of the England team from 2001 to 2006, guiding stars including David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney at World Cups and Euros. But he suddenly stepped down from his last football post with Swedish club Karlstad in February last year for health reasons. His cancer diagnosis was kept a closely guarded secret until he announced his illness without warning in an interview on Swedish radio station P1 on Wednesday. The fitness fanatic and legendary ladies' man revealed he collapsed and fell on a regular 5km run. Doctors found he had suffered a series of mini-strokes and had pancreatic cancer. He said: ""They don't know how long I had cancer, maybe a month or a year. Everyone understands I have an illness that is not good. Everyone guesses it's cancer and it is. But I have to fight as long as I can."" Asked about the prospects, Sven said he had ""maybe at best a year, at worst a little less, or at best maybe even longer. You can't be absolutely sure. It's best not to think about it, don't wallow."" Sven told BBC Sport yesterday: ""I thought I was fully healthy, but suddenly I had a stroke, small stroke, so I fell. ""My children took me to the hospital and after one day of examination, they told me I had five small strokes, but that's OK, they said, no problem, you recovered 100 per cent from that. But the worse thing, they said, is that you have cancer. ""I have that diagnosis and they can't operate. When you get a message like that, I think you appreciate every day and you're happy when you wake up in the morning and you feel OK."" Rooney - handed his international debut aged 17 by Eriksson in 2003 - urged his former boss to ""keep fighting"" yesterday. The England football team put a message online saying simply: ""Sending our love, Sven."" Former England star Trevor Sinclair wrote: ""An absolute gentleman and excellent coach that I am eternally grateful to, as I earned all my England caps under him. I wish him love and comfort during his final battle."" Manchester City, a club Sven managed, said: ""We wish to express our collective support to our former manager, and his family and friends, during this time."" European football's governing body Uefa added: ""The whole of European football is with you, Sven."" His family and pals had spent months stonewalling mounting concern for the popular football figure.

The lawyer said: ""He said nothing about it when we were in the car on the way to the radio station in Karlstad. I don't know whether he decided right before or during the interview. This has been a very difficult thing for Sven and I think he has considered for a long time about when and how to tell about it publicly. ""It has been tough for him.

Ministers have been told they have either returned home, despite the war with Russia, or moved on to other countries. Just under 107,000 Ukrainians came here and claimed temporary protection when Vladimir Putin's army invaded in 2022. But, as of May 19, 45,000 are in State-serviced accommodation, such as hotels and B&Bs. This number has fallen from 60,000 only last September. Around 8,000 Ukrainian people currently live in homes pledged and provided by the public. Their rooms are paid for by the State. Since March, new arrivals from Ukraine have to stay in designated accommodation centres and there are currently 6,000 there. This means 65,500 are accounted for in State-provided or pledged accommodation. The remaining 41,000 who originally arrived are classed by the Government as ""category unknown"". These have either returned home, gone to another country or are staying in privately sourced accommodation. Previous Central Statistics Office data from late last year estimated that only 78 per cent of PPS numbers which were given to Ukrainian refugees were active, a clear indication that many had left Ireland. A Government insider said: ""Essentially the numbers of Ukrainians arriving are well down and all the data shows at least 25,000 appear to have moved on since 2022."" Ministers expect the numbers to continue falling after the recent crackdown on Government payments and free accommodation for refugees.

The Deputy First Minister revealed £615million in budget ""savings"" to help balance the books on top of £560million previously unveiled in September. The latest list includes £400million ""reprioritised"" within funds for health and social care - meaning effective cuts to mental health, social care and Covid-related spending. The cash will instead help meet the costs of rising pay offers for NHS staff aimed at averting winter strikes. Mr Swinney claimed that, without more Westminster funds, he had no option but to find more savings amid soaring inflation, the £700million extra needed for better pay deals and the bill for the Ukrainian refugees scheme And the senior Nat - standing in as Finance Secretary - blasted Tory ministers for their handling of the economy. He described it as a ""calamity giving way to austerity"" that was making the UK's financial crisis worse. They decisions are to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt put back plans for a new ""fiscal statement"" from Halloween to November 17. He is expected to set out brutal cuts and tax rises following a huge hike in the cost of government borrowing in the wake of predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous mini-budget. But Mr Swinney told MSPs he could ""wait no longer"" for the Treasury's plans to outline his own proposals. Revealing the new cuts in his Emergency Budget Review, he said: ""They are not decisions we'd wish to make. But in the absence of additional funding from the UK Government, they are decisions we are compelled to make."" He said the impact of soaring inflation meant the Scottish Budget was worth £1.7billion less than when it was set out last December. The Nats No2 added: ""There has never been a time of greater pressure on the public finances."" Pointing to the Scottish Government lacking borrowing powers to offset the cost of inflation, Mr Swinney went on: ""I must balance the books. ""But I am committed to doing so in a way that prioritises funding to help families, to back business, to provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services."" However, his cost-saving measures include cuts to frontline services, such as within the beleaguered NHS. While the health budget as a whole hasn't been cut, £400million has been shifted from key areas to afford pay deals for employees. Funds set aside for Covid measures - such as vaccines plus Test and Protect - will be slashed by £116million, while mental health will lose £38million. And £70million will be taken from social care, with the ""development"" of the SNP's flagship National Care Service now facing an unspecified delay. Elsewhere, the Scottish Government has found £150million in savings from capital budgets that pay for infrastructure projects and other investments. That includes £61million axed from the ""Net Zero"" capital budget, such as £28.5million for low-carbon buses and £14.7million from road, rail and canal eco projects. Another £10million will come from the botched scheme to give every schoolpupil a free laptop computer. are we compelled make There will also be £16million less for the R100 broadband rollout to the most remote areas. Justice, education, social security, tourism and economic development were among departments hit with extra ""resource savings"" totalling nearly £34million. But Tories hit out after it emerged the £20million earmarked for IndyRef2 had been left untouched. Shadow Finance Secretary Liz Smith said: ""Current difficult circumstances do not absolve the Deputy First Minister or his colleagues of responsibility for the position Scotland finds itself in after 15 years of their government. ""He has announced yet more huge cuts to health, education and justice. ""However, he won't touch the constitution budget. ""He made much of the fixed and finite nature of the Scottish Government's budget. But the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that he and his colleagues, not the UK Government, bear the responsibility - and that they prefer a divisive referendum to practical support measures."" Labour's Daniel Johnson said: ""The Tories' economic vandalism has pushed things to crisis point. But years of low growth and mismanagement from both our governments has laid the groundwork for this perfect storm. ""Nicola Sturgeon promised to open the books and take a Team Scotland approach to tackling the cost of living crisis. But she hasn't."" And Lib Dems leader Alex Cole- Hamilton slammed Mr Swinney over the cuts to the mental health budget. Last night medics warned the cuts risked making the situation in the NHS becoming even more ""precarious"". Dr Lailah Peel, deputy chair of BMA Scotland, said: ""Healthcare is under huge pressure so any area deprioritised will be a cause for serious concern. ""More patients are presenting with mental health issues since the pandemic and cuts to a service already on its knees could be hugely damaging."" Meanwhile, MSPs were told a ""flat cash"" funding settlement for the justice sector could lead to three or four court buildings closing and the system becoming slower. The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service, warned a Holyrood committee that costsaving options could also include reducing summary and civil cases by 25 per cent. Tory Jamie Greene said: ""I'm concerned about the effect that may have on a backlog which is already immense."" The Scottish Prison Service said there was ""very limited"" opportunity to scale back their operations in order to cut costs. Responding to Mr Swinney's announcement, a No10 source said: ""The Scottish Government is receiving a record £41billion block grant from the Treasury. The UK Government is also investing over £2billion in Scotland for our Levelling Up agenda."" dan.vevers@the-sun.co.uk See The Sun Says £116m cuts to Covid measures including jabs and PPE £38m slashed from mental health services £70m lost from social care budgets £65m from primary care, including cash to pay for extra GPs £13m for doubling investment in sport now delayed £40m gone from school infrastructure funds £28.5m slashed from low emission bus schemes £15m cuts to energy project funding £14.7m gone from green road, rail and canal schemes £10m held back from City Deals programmes £6.2m cuts to rural and marine projects £21m savings from justice and veterans budget £5m from social security funds including child poverty £2.9m education cuts including cash for 'raising attainment' £3.3m axed from finance such as tourism promotion He They are decisions we are compelled to make Graphic   Money troubles ...

It comes as Micheal Martin laid down his ""bottom line"" in the Cabinet dispute on reducing supports to Ukrainians and declared children must be allowed to stay in Irish schools. Last week, a row broke out between Cabinet ministers about proposals to reduce supports available to Ukrainian refugees coming here to escape the Russian invasion. Equality Minister Roderic O'Gorman wants to put a three-month limit on housing given to refugees, with the Government also discussing reducing welfare payments. Proposals to provide Ukrainian children with 'in-house' education within State accommodation has also been discussed. Earlier this week, The Irish Sun reported on concerns from Ukrainian families living here about the impact cuts to supports would have on their children. Asked about their concerns, Mr Martin ruled out children being denied access to Irish schools. The Tanaiste has also indicated any three-month time limit on housing for Ukrainian refugees would only impact new arrivals here. Asked about the threemonth housing rule, he told The Irish Sun: ""That's not contemplated for those already in accommodation. ""Close to 98,000 now have come into the country and obviously that creates its own challenges. ""The Government will continue to review this and give this consideration."" However, the Fianna Fail leader laid down his ""bottom line"" in the dispute on cutting back supports to Ukrainian people - kids must be allowed stay in Irish schools. He told The Irish Sun: ""Children coming into the country must always be educated and must always be facilitated in terms of access to schools - that would be a bottom line to me.""

The US President sounded the warning as world leaders met to discuss measures available to combat Vladimir Putin amid fears he could use the barbaric munitions. Boris Johnson warned the Kremlin dictator would face ""catastrophic consequences"" if he dared do so, as concerned western chiefs stepped up preparations to ship out hazmat suits to war-torn Ukraine. The British PM did not rule out putting boots on the ground in the event of a chemical strike, as Mr Biden warned that the West could launch a ""response in kind"" at the landmark summit at Nato's HQ. It came as Nato stepped up chemical and nuclear defences and announced 6,000 soldiers in four new battalions would head to Eastern Europe to bolster the 40,000 already facing down Putin's forces. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, meanwhile, pleaded with world leaders to send him ""one per cent"" of their aircraft and tanks. In other developments: l VLADIMIR Putin's spokesman declared Boris Johnson enemy number one for leading the world in response to Russia's aggression; l THE US vowed to put up 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and provide $1billion more help; l PRESIDENT Biden said the US would ship liquified gas to Europe to try to help countries wean themselves off Russia's fuel; l BRITAIN slapped sanctions on another slew of Russian oligarchs and banking chiefs, and; l RUSSIAN TV warned of nuclear war if Nato sends in troops to the region. Mr Johnson told the Brussels mega-summit of EU and G7 chiefs that using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be ""catastrophic"" for Putin. He said: ""There is a visceral horror of the use of these weapons of mass destruction. I think that if Putin were to engage in anything like that, the consequences would be very, very severe."" He added that the Alliance must maintain ""ambiguity"" to keep Putin second guessing their response. The PM pleaded with world leaders not to abandon President Zelensky - but admitted Britain could not provide him with the tanks and jets he has asked for. French President Emmanuel Macron also ruled out sending tanks and warplanes to Ukraine as it risked making the EU a ""co-belligerent"" in the war. Slovenian PM Janez Jansa warned that Russia could unleash a ""catastrophe"" on Europe by accidentally shelling a chemical plant. He told Putin such a scenario ""could"" trigger Nato's Article 5 defence clause that states an attack on one is an attack on all. The new troops announced yesterday will be posted to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Brit troops are already stationed in Poland and Estonia and will play a part in the new forces plan. But behind closed doors, officials talked down the possibility of triggering an aggressive response, saying it would make too many countries ""direct"" targets. And they admitted that the huge package of international sanctions was not pushing Putin to change his mind about the disastrous war. Senior officials also played down the prospect of putting Nato boots on the ground in Ukraine. Poland raged at other EU leaders for urging Mr Zelensky to make concessions in ongoing peace talks. President Biden would only say it was ""their judgment to make"" if they wanted to negotiate. Whitehall sources said the PM had been privately urging Mr Biden to stand firm for as long as possible, insisting Ukraine should get to decide its own destiny. In a virtual address to the allies yesterday, President Zelensky urged the leaders for ""one per cent of all your planes, one per cent of all your tanks"" but it appeared his demand would not be met. Piling fresh pressure on Western nations to step up their help he said it would show ""who is a friend, who is a partner and who has sold out and betrayed us"". Mr Johnson, meanwhile, praised the Ukrainian leader, right, saying: ""Volodymyr Zelensky has proved to be one of the most extraordinary war leaders of recent times. ""He has marshalled world opinion and mobilised his country. ""What he wants from us is more diplomatic pressure around the world. He wants tighter economic sanctions on the Putin regime. ""He wants some very specific military support, defensive military support for the Ukrainian armed forces and that we are determined to provide."" Mr Johnson hailed him as Ukraine's Churchill in their darkest hour. He told LBC: ""He knows, as Churchill said of himself, he may not have been the lion but he's been privileged to give the roar."" The PM also branded Putin a war criminal for the first time - saying he had ""crossed the red line"". But he denied he was anti Russian and said he had nothing against the innocent people who were getting dragged into the conflict by Putin. @IrishSunOnline Graphic   A UNITED STAND Johnson, Biden, Macron & other world leaders gather at Nato HQ yesterday",Tabloid,1,2022-03,1,Policy

The town made them feel welcome by hanging bunting in their national colours around the main square. The children and their guardians were meant to fly from Poland on Monday, but a vital document from the Ukrainian government was not ready in time. They eventually arrived via London in the early hours of yesterday morning.

She misses her boyfriend and her family but more importantly she believes that after nearly three months away she has a duty to be back in her home country. ""I've got an opportunity to live and work safely in England in a very difficult moment, but I feel that I'll be more useful in Ukraine and for Ukraine,"" she said. ""I believe that I'm from that generation that will rebuild Ukraine after we win the war. Every refugee that comes back home will help to make Ukraine a better place. ""I'm inspired with experience of life in a highly developed country, where anyone can open a new business, anyone can become a politician and anyone can just work fair and hard to create a strong and happy country. All Ukrainians who will come back home, including me, will make their contribution to the future prosperity of Ukraine."" Markovets, who goes by the name Kate in England, has been living in rural Cheshire since June. Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme 84,000 Ukrainian refugees have moved in with 25,000 British households since March. Her hosts, Dave and Liz Robinson, have treated her like their own daughter, making sure that they eat their evening meal together, giving her lifts and checking that she is safe when she is out. ""Kate had asked us to send some information about where she would be staying to her mum, which we did and promised to take good care of her,"" Dave Robinson said. ""Consequently we have treated her as one of our children so, perhaps, have been overprotective at times, being ready to give lifts and checking that she is safe when she has gone on trips away."" The past three months have been an education for the pair of them too as they have learnt a lot about Ukrainian customs, culture and food. ""It has been quite embarrassing to admit how little we knew about Ukraine before the current conflict,"" he said. Markovets has introduced them to traditional Ukrainian dishes, including borscht, which is a beetroot soup, and mlyntsi, a stuffed pancake dish. The Robinsons have also got to know their own local area better as a result of Markovets staying, which has forced them out of their normal routines to find new pubs, villages and churches to visit. They have taken her on days out to Liverpool and Wales, hiked to the top of Snowdon and arranged trips for her to London, Edinburgh and Birmingham. She said: ""Edinburgh has some magical atmosphere. I was there during the Fringe festival so the city seems to me very alive, bright but still cosy."" Rural Cheshire feels a million miles away from her home town of Sarny, about 25 miles from the border with Belarus. She experienced war firsthand while she was visiting her parents there from Kyiv when Russian missiles began hitting the town in February. The nature of her work as a freelance digital marketing manager for Ukrainian businesses has enabled her to continue her work remotely. She had no prior connection with the Robinsons. They met on a website called Opora that matched refugees with UK hosts. They had produced a PowerPoint presentation to show refugees what they had to offer. Fast-forward three months and the three of them are sad to be saying farewell. Markovets has made so many friends locally that she spent all day saying goodbye to people as they popped in throughout the day on Saturday, her birthday, and more came to dinner in the evening. The government has appealed for more volunteers as a quarter of existing ones have said that they can no longer host refugees beyond the initial sixmonth period that they signed up for. As Markovets returns home tomorrow, another refugee, Nazarii, is preparing to finally fly the other way after waiting five months for the Home Office to issue his visa. Despite matching with a UK host family in Church Crookham, Hampshire, back in March, his visa application has hit numerous obstacles and repeated delays because he is 17, which makes him a minor. Until July the Home Office did not allow unaccompanied minors to come to the UK. He is now waiting for his 18th birthday, on September 11, before a fast-tracked visa can be issued. Nazarii is looking forward to coming to England, although he will be sad to leave behind his father, who is a doctor, and mother, who has to stay in Ukraine to look after his grandmother. He said: ""This territory is not so dangerous as the eastern regions but isn't safe, because it's the war in the whole of Ukraine versus Russia and we don't know what this stupid terrorist state will do tomorrow."" Despite never having met his UK hosts, Sam and Tim Read and their son, Theo, who is also 17, Nazarii already sees them as family. ""I have been communicating with my brilliant sponsor family for almost five months and at this time I have realised that British people are very kind and ready to help Ukrainians like an older brother. We all are very grateful for the UK."" The Reads said that the experience had made them lose all faith in the Home Office. ""We opened our hearts and promised his family to keep him safe and care for him as if he was one of our children,"" Sam Read said. ""So if it hadn't worked we would not have opened ourselves up for more upset. I've also lost faith in the Home Office. The wait for Nazarii and his family has caused them stress they didn't need."" Not all hosts and their refugees have got on without hiccups under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. For David and Nancy, they are beginning to get a little fed up with their refugee, Olena, a 36-year-old woman who is on holiday in Croatia. It had been a ""largely positive experience"" having her to stay in their north London home, Nancy said, but they believe she needs to get out of the house more. ""She has been here almost seven weeks now and we feel it's time for her to get a job here,"" Nancy said. ""She has applied for universal credit and got it. She still does some work for her company in Ukraine, but we feel it's time to engage in London working life, not wait another two months, as is her plan, when she will have completed her English classes. ""We had thought she would be out of the house Monday to Friday 9 to 5ish most days but now that isn't the case it does impinge a bit on our daily lives and is starting to get a bit annoying. Working at the kitchen table on her laptop is a bit intrusive day after day."" The couple do not regret signing up for the scheme, but they say they will need to sit down with Olena to discuss her plans if she intends to stay beyond the initial six months to which they committed. They have not yet received a penny of the £350 monthly ""thank you"" payment that the government has promised hosts, and hope that it starts being paid soon to help to pay for rising living costs.

The levelling-up secretary will address council leaders at the end of the month and is keen to announce two ""investment zones"" that would offer companies incentives and drive growth. Any deals would be struck alongside the Scottish government, and Gove pushed the plans during a meeting with Humza Yousaf at the British Irish Council summit in Jersey last week. The senior Conservative also held talks with Shona Robison, the deputy first minister, in Dundee, which UK government sources described as positive and constructive. The leaders of Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow city councils have told Gove they want investment zone status after missing out on becoming freeports. Gove wants to push Whitehall back towards a more constructive relationship with the Scottish government and to shift away from the muscular unionism that has previously been advocated by his cabinet colleagues. Fights with SNP and Green ministers over the blocking of gender reforms and placing tight restrictions on an internal market exemption request to the deposit return scheme have led to heavy criticism from Holyrood. Yousaf recently claimed that devolution was becoming ""unworkable"" after interventions by UK ministers into Scottish government decisions - and it appears the public have sympathy for the first minister's view. A poll last week by Panelbase found that 47 per cent of voters believed Westminster was intent on eroding devolution by reducing the powers of the Scottish parliament. Only 32 per cent disagreed. Despite the public pushback, UK government figures are confident they will be seen to be on the right side of the argument. A source said: ""We are not looking to pick fights with the Scottish government but we do need to make the right decisions for all parts of the UK, including Scotland. The UK government is confident that we will take the difficult decisions, even if we know that it will attract criticism from the devolved governments."" Policies are expected to drip out of Whitehall in the coming weeks, including the probable sign-off on drilling at the controversial Rosebank oilfield, off Shetland. Ministers will say that shows the support being offered to Scotland's energy sector and attempt to contrast that with Labour's plans to ban new exploration licences if Sir Keir Starmer becomes prime minister. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is also expected to visit Scotland and will hail Scotland's support of Ukrainian refugees and charitable work. Ministers installed by Yousaf after he became first minister in March have been tasked with drawing up policy ideas but the Scottish government still has a pile-up of domestic issues. The number of patients waiting 12 hours or more in accident and emergency has increased again, after falling for three weeks in a row, and ministers have once again missed their climate targets. Yousaf has also focused on independence in the past few days, setting out plans on Monday for a constitution before the SNP convention on Saturday to discuss the route to an independent Scotland.

That represents a tenth of the 12,500 visas granted under the programme since it began three weeks ago. A further 31,000 Ukrainians are waiting for their visa to be granted by the Home Office having completed forms to connect them with their UK hosts. Under the separate family scheme, little over a third of the 28,500 Ukrainians issued visas have arrived. In total, 12,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to the UK since the war began on February 24. The home secretary told the BBC: ""It's been frustrating. I apologise with frustration myself. I'll be candid, it has taken time. Any new visa system takes time."" The numbers arriving in the UK are significantly lower than in its EU neighbours, which do not require visa checks for Ukrainians. Ireland said this week that 20,000 had arrived. France had seen 30,000 enter the country by a week ago while the German government said it had accepted 300,000 Ukrainians. Patel defended the government's decision to insist on keeping visa requirements despite 4.3 million Ukrainians fleeing the war. ""We are an independent third country and we want to give people the status and security of coming to our country along with the warm welcome,"" she said. ""We have to ensure that they are protected and safeguarded in the United Kingdom as well."" In total, the UK has received 80,000 visa applications under the family scheme and Homes for Ukraine scheme. The Home Office has granted 28,500 visas out of 36,300 applications under the family scheme, But only 10,800 have arrived in the UK. The UK has issued 12,500 visas out of 43,600 applications under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, where UK households match with Ukrainian refugees to accommodate them. Just 1,200 have arrived, or 9.6 per cent of those issued visas. More than 200,000 UK households have registered an interest in the scheme.

Maybe Sir Rod, long devoted to his Scots' heritage despite being born in London, was merely playing up to the national caricature. Or maybe, at 78, he has genuinely changed his ways. Whatever the truth behind his past reputation for stinginess, the singer has spent recent months gleefully destroying it. As with Scrooge at the end of A Christmas Carol, there is no one quite so bountiful as a reformed miser. Sir Rod spent new year with his wife, Penny Lancaster, and two of his eight children at Gleneagles hotel in his father's native land. Once their globally famous guest had checked out, staff were delighted to discover he had left a £10,000 tip, presumably not tucked in an envelope on the fourposter's pillow. This munificence follows the star making good on his pledge, offered during a TV phone-in a year ago, to pay for 20 MRI cancer scans at his local hospital in Harlow, Essex. Having just had his own scan in Harley Street, Sir Rod was moved by the injustice of his less wealthy neighbours waiting weeks for their diagnoses. A year prior to that, he footed the bill to house a number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the Russian invasion. At about the same time, concerned for the suspension on his Ferrari, the former gravedigger used his shovel-wielding skills during a DIY pothole-filling shift in the lane outside his home. Even after almost 60 years of stardom, here is a man who has forgotten neither his humble roots, nor the contributions made daily by far less fêted individuals towards the greater good. In the autumn of a charmed life, Sir Rod is spreading his fortune around. Well done to him.",Broadsheet,1,2024-01,NA,NA

Cammy Day said he was shocked to be informed by UK government officials that MS Victoria, home to thousands of Ukrainian refugees for the past year while docked in Leith, is to be repurposed for asylum seekers. While it has not been confirmed that the vessel will remain in Leith, it is understood that the port is one of a number under consideration by the Home Office to provide a temporary home for asylum seekers. At its peak last year MS Victoria housed 1,498 people from Ukraine, mostly women and children, who had fled the Russian invasion. All will have moved out by July 11 as a contract ends between the Scottish government and Landry & Kling, the project managers who ran the facility. It is understood that discussions between the Home Office and Landry & Kling have been going on for several weeks without the knowledge of the council, the Scottish government and Forth Ports, the dock owners. Day said the city had shown ""solidarity"" with the Ukranians, but he was ""extremely surprised"" by the Home Office decision to use the ship to house asylum seekers. He said: ""The potential consequences for the council in terms of the pressures on our services - and the city as a whole - are severe and we will continue to oppose these plans in the strongest terms. ""While the MS Victoria has been a place of refuge for many Ukrainian families arriving in Edinburgh, until we have adequate reassurances from the UK government regarding the welfare and ongoing engagement and support, we cannot allow it to become a floating prison for asylum seekers."" Edinburgh schools and NHS facilities have been placed under severe strain by the sudden influx of refugees. The latest statistics show 496 Ukrainian children enrolled in local schools, with GP surgeries and health visiting services also affected. However, over the past year the ship, which has extensive community and children's facilities and a Ukrainian restaurant, has broadly been praised by politicians and NGOs who visited it. Joyce Landry, the chief executive of Landry & Kling, said those who are likely to live on the ship will not be new arrivals but will have passed the first stage of the asylum process enabling them eventually to settle in the UK. She dismissed the notion that Victoria was a ""prison ship"" and said it would prove beneficial for those who lived aboard. She said: ""People are free to come and go, participate in activities and practise their faith. As we have shown with the Ukrainians, having everyone together is very beneficial in terms of providing English classes, healthcare and the support people need to integrate them into the country."" Humza Yousaf, the first minister, said he had taken up the case with Michael Gove, the communities secretary. The Home Office said it was working with local authorities across the UK to disperse ""fairly"" asylum seekers across the UK and end ""the unacceptable use of hotels"". It has a statutory obligation to provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute while their claims are considered.",Broadsheet,1,2023-06,0,Conditions

Poland received roughly 30,000 displaced Ukrainians over the first 24 hours of the war while 17,500 crossed into Moldova and several thousand more arrived in Slovakia, according to the UN refugee agency. Romania is believed to have taken 10,000 refugees so far and another few thousand have sought refuge in Hungary, which said all five of its crossings on the frontier with Ukraine were at full capacity, with traffic jams stretching for several miles on the Ukrainian side. The total is three times the lower end of the EU's forecasts for the entire conflict, which ranged from 20,000 to more than a million, raising concerns that some countries could be overwhelmed by the influx. UN agencies estimate that more than 100,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and the conflict could drive as many as 5 million to flee. The crisis comes amid growing warnings that the war in the breadbasket of Europe will lead to soaring food prices and leave millions of the world's poor ""knocking on famine's door"".UK government sources said they were not expecting an influx of refugees to move across Europe and the focus was on providing support to help Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Moldova respond to those needing temporary homes. A total of 1,000 UK troops are on standby to support Ukraine's neighbours with refugee responses, James Heappey, the armed forces minister, told MPs yesterday. The Lib Dems and a coalition of humanitarian charities have called on the government to offer an ""ambitious commitment to resettle Ukrainian refugees in the UK"". A government source said: ""We've not seen mass movement across the border yet. The countries around Ukraine are inherently safe so the priority now is to make sure British nationals get out and are safe."" Some refugees said they had walked for 20 hours in sub-zero temperatures to reach Ukraine's frontiers. In the Polish town of Medyka hundreds of cars arrived to collect Ukrainian relatives, including several families that had been separated from their men. Marta Buach, 30, from Lviv, said her husband had been drafted before they could cross the border. Men aged 18 to 60 have been ordered to remain in the country. Pawel Szefernaker, 34, Poland's deputy interior minister, said male Ukrainian coach drivers had been among those prevented from leaving and Ukrainian men in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic travelled home as they received conscription papers. The World Food Programme said the Black Sea basin was one of the world's most important areas for grain and agricultural production. ""We have 283 million people marching towards starvation with 45 million knocking on famine's door,"" it said in a statement.

Almost 2,000 have been offered so far, with many second-home owners pledging their properties to the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme for the next six months. Leeds and Wiltshire were the next most welcoming councils with each accounting for more than 1,500 homes, according to data shared with The Times. There were also a large number of offers in Winchester and Dorset. Cornwall was also responsible for a similarly large proportion of offers made to 666 people resettled under a community sponsorship scheme for Syrian refugees in 2016. Derek Thomas, the Conservative MP for St Ives, said that he had encouraged second-home owners to volunteer their properties in the county because he believed it would bring together communities that had become divided between locals and those whose main residence is in London or elsewhere. He said: ""It's of no surprise but it's great to hear that Cornwall has responded quickly and generously to the difficult situation that refugees face in Poland and other border countries. The use of second homes is something I've encouraged and it makes common sense for people who own property in Cornwall to offer homes in this way. I know that the communities will do everything they can to support and welcome refugees and they'll be very welcome. ""The negative problem we have with homes that aren't permanently lived in is they are right in the middle of communities and at some times of the year it can leave communities quite empty."" Linzi Hanscomb, founder of Newquay Refugee Support Group, said that it had been contacted by several second home-owners offering their accommodation to Ukrainian refugees for six months. ""We have never had that before,"" she said. ""We have several people who have empty cottages or flats which they would normally rent out or let their family use. There is this massive flurry of interest."" Hanscomb said it had taken about 18 months in the past to go through the government and council processes to permanently rehome a refugee. She said that Disclosure and Barring Ser- vice checks could take several weeks. ""We are not quite sure how this new system is going to work,"" she said. Six refugees have already been matched with residents on the privately-owned island of Tresco, the second biggest of the Isles of Scilly in Cornwall. The island has a permanent population of 130 people, of whom about a third are foreign nationals. Yulia Rylska, 24, from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, is among those who will catch a helicopter to make the 24-mile journey from Penzance to Tresco next week. She and five other Ukrainian women will be housed on the island until the war in their home country is over. They had never heard of Tresco until a few days ago. Last night she said that she was still ""very confused"" given the turmoil but was ""looking forward to [coming] to Tresco"". The residents will donate the £350 monthly payment they receive from the government under the Homes for Ukraine scheme to the Ukrainian refugees, who will also be given jobs on the island.

3823,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,15/3/2022,1155 words,Matt Dathan; Ben Webster,Light vetting will boost number er of Ukrainians housed in Britain,"Households offering their homes to Ukrainians will face only ""light-touch"" vetting to maximise the number of refugees who come to the UK. Michael Gove, the communities secretary, said that full DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) checks would not be needed for thousands of people signing up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Individuals and organisations who register to sponsor refugees will be checked against the Police National Computer to protect refugees from exploitative individuals taking advantage of the scheme. There was confusion after Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told Times Radio earlier yesterday that hosts would have ""DBS-style checks"". MPs warned that the lack of a full DBS check on individuals raised serious safeguarding concerns, given the government was suggesting that British households could use social media to match with Ukrainians. Hosts must match up with a Ukrainian refugee or family themselves before submitting a joint visa application with the named individuals. Although hosts could register their interest yesterday, visa applications for the scheme do not open until Friday. Gove said that local authorities, which will be given £10,500 per refugee resettled in their area, would be able to spot signs of abuse. Sponsors would be visited by safeguarding professionals from local government, but only after the Ukrainian refugees had moved in with their UK sponsor. With more than 35,000 households signing up in the first five hours of the scheme opening, there were concerns over how long and how thorough the checks would be. Government sources said that teachers, doctors and nurses would act as an ""additional check"" for problems such as domestic abuse. Announcing the scheme, Gove told MPs: ""We do not believe that we need to have full DBS checks to ensure that someone is an appropriate sponsor. Very light-touch criminal checks will often be sufficient, and then local authorities can be supported to ensure that people are safe."" Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announced yesterday that he would offer to accommodate a Ukraini- an refugee in his home. Gove's hopes of housing a refugee have been complicated because he lives in Carlton Gardens, a grace-and-favour residence, since separating from his wife, Sarah Vine, last year. Security concerns are preventing him from hosting refugees at the apartment. It is normally the foreign secretary's official London residence but Liz Truss offered it to him after he moved out of his family home. Aides said that he is more likely to use his constituency home in Surrey Heath to accommodate refugees. Priti Patel is unlikely to host refugees because of security concerns over living with a home secretary, while Downing Street indicated that the prime minister would not be taking any Ukrainian refugees in. Boris Johnson's official spokesman said that it was up to individual ministers whether they chose to give accommodation to a refugee. ""There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10,"" he said. ""Obviously it will come down to individual circumstances. This is a significant commitment."" Javid said that it would be difficult to ""offer the time"" to host Ukrainian refugees in his home. He said it was important that those who offered to become a host could spend time with resettled families. Separately, the government announced emergency measures yesterday to allow all Ukrainian refugees to bring their pets into the UK. The government will cover the cost of any quarantine required. Animal welfare groups had warned that cats and dogs travelling with refugees might have to be euthanised unless the UK relaxed rules on pet travel. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We have put in place a new streamlined process for people bringing their pets from Ukraine. The Animal and Plant Health Agency will provide quick approvals and relevant quarantine arrangements, for which we will cover the costs."" An RSPCA spokeswoman said: ""We're pleased that for refugees coming to the UK they won't have the added heartbreak of leaving their pets behind."" Letters, page 24 Scheme will work only if charities are in driving seat, leading article, page 25 Q&A What is the new scheme announced yesterday? Homes for Ukraine allows individuals, businesses, charities and community groups to bring people escaping the war to safety even if they have no ties to the UK. Who can sign up? Anyone with a room or home available can offer it to a Ukrainian individual or a family as long as they can commit to at least six months. Does the host have to be living in the property? No. Will hosts be vetted? Yes, but only ""very light-touch"" checks will be carried out as the government wants to get as many refugees matched as soon as possible. Hosts will be checked against the police national computer to detect exploitative individuals. Will hosts' homes be checked? Yes, sponsors will be visited by safeguarding professionals from the local authority to assess whether the property and individuals are appropriate after those who have moved in. How do hosts sign up? By filling out a form at www.homesforukraine.campaign.gov.uk. Hosts are asked whether they can offer sixnine months, 10-12 months, or more than 12 months. They can sign up to accommodate a single adult, multiple adults or families and can also offer a number of properties. What happens next? After hosts have passed basic security checks, they must name an individual or family they wish to accommodate in a separate visa application form that they can fill in from Friday. How do hosts and refugees get matched? UK hosts are responsible for finding the Ukrainians and must name individuals or families they want to bring to the UK. This will rely on UK hosts having connections, or finding refugees through social networks on or offline. Organisations such as the Sanctuary Foundation have set up a consortium of bodies that will help match hosts with refugees. What if hosts cannot find a refugee to sponsor? They will have to wait until the second phase of the scheme is launched within the next few weeks. They can register their interest on the same form as above. How long can refugees stay? Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years' leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services. What checks will be carried out on Ukrainians? Those with Ukrainian passports will be allowed to apply online and travel to the UK without attending a visa centre but must submit their biometric details at a centre in the UK within six months of arriving. Is there any compensation? Those offering a place to stay will receive an optional tax-free monthly payment of £350 which will not affect benefit entitlements or council tax status. Councils will be entitled to £10,500 per Ukrainian refugee. Hosts must not charge any rent. How many have applied? There were over 44,000 offers in the first six hours.

It confirmed that the contract to use the MS Ambition, which is docked near Glasgow, would come to an end on March 31.

He added that the Scottish government would look to make ""full use"" of both existing and new volunteer hosts to provide somewhere to stay for the refugees.

The cruise liner is docked in Leith and is housing about 1,275 Ukrainians. Gray said: ""The MS Ambition was a temporary measure.

After spending more than 20 hours in a cramped train from Lviv, 43 miles away, with her nine-year-old grandson Sebastian and the family's cat and dog, she had made it to the safety of Poland. It would not be long before Sebastian was reunited with his parents, already in the country. Yet Olga was haunted by thoughts of those she had left in the path of the Russian offensive, including her son and Sebastian's uncle, who had been conscripted. ""My son and his wife have to stay behind,"" she said. ""He has to - and wants to - fight for Ukraine. It's hard."" Over the weekend the number of Ukrainians fleeing more than trebled to at least 386,000. More than 115,000 crossed into Poland, 70,000 into Moldova, 62,000 into Hungary and 41,000 into Romania. Another 26,000 were registered by the Slovakian authorities. The prospect of fighting, with Russian forces attacking civilian targets, has raised concerns that up to 5 million of the country's 44 million people could be forced out. Poland, which already has a population of about a million Ukrainians and has solicited migrant labour from Ukraine in the past, is expecting up to 1.5 million refugees. Many border checkpoints have been overwhelmed by the volume of people attempting to escape, with tailbacks of more than 12 miles at Ukraine's frontier with Moldova and queues lasting longer than 24 hours at other crossings. Some refugees, including children, spent a freezing night without food or medical aid on the Ukrainian side of the border after a computer failure halted the processing of departures. Jacob and Jessie Boekmann, doctors from the United States, left Kyiv with their two-day-old baby, Vivian, shortly after the first missiles struck. After getting stuck in traffic for seven hours at the Polish border they abandoned their car and walked the final eight miles. ""If we had stayed in the car, I think it would have taken us days or weeks to get across,"" Jessie Boekmann said. In what she described as the ""complete chaos"" on the border, the couple were separated because the Ukrainian authorities refused to let any men aged between 18 and 60 leave. It took ten hours and an intervention from the US embassy before her husband could join his family at their Polish hotel. While many Ukrainians escaping the war will stay with friends and family already in neighbouring countries, thousands are in limbo, waiting to learn where they can continue their lives until it is safe to go home, if it ever is. Przemysl's old railway station, an ornate relic of the Habsburg empire, has been converted into a makeshift refugee centre, its grand restaurant now a soup kitchen. Roksana, 51, had just arrived after catching one of the last trains out of Kyiv. She wept when she thought about her daughter in the western city of Rivne, which has come under Russian missile fire, and her brother, who is helping to defend Kyiv. ""It's hard, very hard,"" Roksana said. ""My heart is broken. I want to tell Putin to give back our peace to us. I want to live and work for my daughter, for my children. I am expecting grandchildren. I want to live just like any other ordinary person. I want children to go to schools, get married, study."" Around the station soldiers, police and border guards hand out food and water and for those moving on, the Polish government is allowing Ukrainians free travel on its rail network. Many ordinary people, including some of the million or so Ukrainian citizens already living in Poland, have come to help. One is Pawel, 33, who drove with friends from Szczecin near the Baltic and is offering to take displaced compatriots to their next destination. ""When the war started, I just went into shock and I couldn't do anything, I couldn't even work,"" he said. ""So the next day I just decided to come here because I just want to help our citizens."" Some of those fleeing Ukraine have found it hard to make the journey because of difficulty getting permission to board the trains even with tickets. Romeo, 29, a Nigerian student at Kyiv International University, claimed white Ukrainians were given priority. Ukraine's neighbours have mobilised in a humanitarian response to the crisis. Tens of thousands of people queued at sites across Poland, including Legia Warsaw's stadium, to donate blood, while other Poles donated hundreds of tonnes of food or made space in their homes for refugees. Twenty Latvian drivers volunteered to make a 1,300- mile round trip to Poland to bring refugees to the Baltic coast. Germany has offered free railway tickets to Ukrainians crossing Poland.

The task now will be to match the British offers of support with Ukrainians who want to come to the UK. The sheer scale of interest means there may be an oversupply of hosts in this initial phase. The government is also responsible for resettling the Afghans evacuated from Kabul airport last August. The Afghan Warm Welcome scheme has now stalled, with many people still in temporary hotels. By simply asking those who register for the Ukraine scheme if they are also interested in hosting other groups, the government could speed up its efforts to offer a warm welcome to Afghans too. Sunder Katwala, director, British Future; David Goodhart, head, Demography, Immigration and Integration Unit, Policy Exchange; Luke Tryl, UK director, More in Common Sir, Your leading article (""Refugees Welcome"", Mar 15) was much too kind to the government. Surely the open-hearted welcome to Ukrainian refugees by the British people puts to shame the bureaucratic bungling by Priti Patel and her colleagues. Lord Steel of Aikwood Selkirk, Scottish Borders Sir, Michael Gove says that he has ""just had it right up to here with people trying to suggest that this country is not generous"". So have all of us. The country is generous: it's the government that is mean and petty. Gareth Williams Rockhampton, Glos Sir, I oppose the £350 a month that will be paid to British households to accommodate Ukrainian refugees. This payment may attract the attention of unscrupulous landlords and lead to scams experienced previously with government-funded schemes such as furlough payments. The £350 should be a charitable gesture to support the desperate needs of Ukrainian refugees in a time of unprecedented crisis. I would far rather the money were spent implementing a robust safeguarding policy to ensure the safety of Ukrainian women and children fleeing a war zone and on providing them with funding for the best possible care and support that this country can offer. Helen Hanson Chester Sir, Angela Thomsett (letter, Mar 14) suggests that those fortunate enough to own second homes and Airbnbs should offer them to refugees. She may be surprised to know that many owners have already done so. However, as several of my friends have found, if the accommodation offered is not in large towns or cities it will not be taken up. The guests are allowed to choose who and where their hosts will be and most opt to be near city centres. As they will need to attend job and welfare interviews it is probably a wise choice.

Prince William, who this month went unannounced on to the streets of London to sell The Big Issue, said that he wanted to ""shine a spotlight"" on the issue of homelessness. William, cover star of the magazine's latest issue, wrote in an article: ""While I may seem like one of the most unlikely advocates for this cause, I have always believed in using my platform to help tell those stories and to bring attention and action to those who are struggling. I plan to do that now I'm turning 40, even more than I have in the past. ""So, for my part, I commit to continue doing what I can to shine a spotlight on this solvable issue not just today, but in the months and years to come."" He said that he would also tell his children about homelessness in the same way that his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, first took him to a homeless centre in London called The Passage when he was a boy. ""I was 11 when I first visited a homeless shelter with my mother, who in her own inimitable style was determined to shine a light on an overlooked, misunderstood problem. ""In the years ahead, I hope to bring George, Charlotte and Louis to see the fantastic organisations doing inspiring work to support those most in need ? just as my mother did for me."" William, who described his time selling The Big Issue as ""eye opening"", went out with Dave Martin, 60, a regular vendor who normally sells the magazine in Hammersmith, west London. Wearing a red vendor's vest and baseball cap and official accreditation on his chest, the duke joined Martin outside a Sainsbury's Local in Victoria, a tenminute walk from Buckingham Palace. People quickly recognised him and word soon spread. But anyone wanting a selfie with the future king had to buy a copy of the magazine first. The outing was not publicised by Kensington Palace, although the news soon emerged online. In less than an hour they sold 32 copies. ""How long would it take for you to sell those normally?"" William asked. About half a week, Martin told him. Later, in a conversation between the two of them for the magazine, Martin said: ""When are we going to do this again? We'll do 50 next time, at least!"" William replied: ""Honestly, I really enjoyed it. Thank you for looking after me. When you first do it, I can see it's daunting. You just don't quite know what's going to happen or how it's going to go."" He added: ""I really enjoyed it. I could have spent many more hours out there with you."" During his time on the streets William chatted to a number of people who had fled the war in Ukraine and he told the magazine: ""We met two Ukrainian refugees. The daughter lives here, she's brought her mum from Kyiv. Sadly they've lost a number of family members and most of their property. The grandmother is still out there. ""And then there was another gentleman who undid his shirt like Superman with a Ukrainian logo on there. He's got his whole family over here and they've lost everything. From Mariupol."" In the question-and-answer session, William suggested that momentum for tackling homelessness, fostered by the Everyone In initiative in which rough sleepers were moved into accommodation at the start of the pandemic, may have been lost but he remained optimistic. He told Martin, a Big Issue seller for 11 years: ""I felt my birthday was a good opportunity. I wanted to make sure were highlighting something that matters to me.

The government is expected to announce plans to use half a dozen holiday parks, which are anticipated to be available from January once talks about the length of leases have concluded. Ministers also want to expand the use of old university halls of residence to cut the need for hotels. One such site already housing migrants is the former Canterbury Christ Church University building in Broadstairs, Kent. Disused military bases similar to the RAF site at Manston, which was turned into a processing centre, are also being considered as a ""long-term"" solution. The government believes that using old student halls and empty holiday camps would be a ""win-win"" because they would be cheaper than hotels. Several local councils, including in Rishi Sunak's own constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire, have moved homeless people and Ukrainian refugees out of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers. The issue is also becoming politically toxic, with many Tory MPs objecting to the use of hotels in their areas. A government source said: ""Student accommodation and disused holiday camps are not going to attract the same kind of criticism."" Albanian people smugglers have urged migrants to pay for crossings this week due to ""calm"" conditions. One Continued on page 2 continued from page 1 Migrant accommodation post on TikTok offered prices of (EURO)3,000 for a small boat crossing and promised a maximum of 27 people on board. In contrast, it said journeys in the back of a lorry would cost (EURO)20,000. More than 44,000 migrants have crossed the Channel this year and officials believe there are about 6,000 people who want to make the journey in the coming weeks, which could take this year's total to more than 50,000. At the weekend Lee Anderson, the Conservative MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, appeared to issue a veiled threat to quit the party if illegal immigration was not tackled. Writing in the Mail on Sunday he said: ""If this isn't solved within the first three months of 2023, we will struggle to retain the red wall and my conscience will be severely tested because I want to stand as a Conservative candidate representing a party that will put the interests of my constituents before the thousands of illegal immigrants arriving here every month."" David Davis, a former Brexit secretary, told Times Radio that the Tories would lose the next election if they failed to grip the issue. ""It won't matter whether Lee [Anderson] stands as a Tory or anything else, he won't get elected,"" he said. ""None of us will."" He said that Albania should be declared a ""safe country"" so claims could be fast-tracked. ""If they do that, it won't solve the whole problem,"" he said. ""But it will take a third of it out. And it means the rest becomes manageable."" During the Tory leadership campaign in the summer, Sunak pledged to ""deliver thousands of new beds through a range of existing and novel solutions, including the use of cruise ships"". A Home Office source said that while the idea of using cruise ships as accommodation was discussed in a recent meeting, they were less likely to be used than holiday parks and former student halls. The Home Office has also looked into using Barton Ashes Airfield near Winchester in Hampshire. The Scottish government chartered a cruise ship in Glasgow to house Ukrainian refugees this year.

3786,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,10/3/2022,577 words,Matt Dathan,Anger increasing at failure to provide humanitarian help; Analysis,"Britain's chaotic and under whelming response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis is a combination of political reluctance, Home Office bureaucracy and misjudgment (Matt Dathan writes). First, the refusal to drop visa requirements was driven by Priti Patel, the home secretary, seeking to prioritise security concerns over the humanitarian situation, according to officials at the Home Office. ""Her focus is very much on the security of the UK. That is her ultimate viewpoint and therefore she's not looking at it from a humanitarian issue,"" one senior Home Office official said. This is driven by her political instincts but also the experience of the evacuation effort in Afghanistan, when concerns were raised over individuals being let into Britain despite being found to be on terrorist watchlists. Patel even rang her Irish counterpart to express concerns about their so-called open-door approach to admitting Ukrainian refugees, which has led to more than 2,000 being welcomed into the country, more than double the UK's response. The home secretary is concerned that Russian agents could use the route as a back door into Britain, given the common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The requirement to conduct biometric checks on every Ukrainian coming to the UK has placed a limit on the speed at which visas can be granted, and will do so for as long as the checks remain in place. Practical concerns about where the Ukrainian refugees will live have also helped to drive caution in Britain's response. Both the Home Office and Michael Gove's housing and communities department are terrified of the practical obstacles of having to find accommodation for tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees when they have failed to find homes for 12,000 Afghans seven months after the evacuation of Kabul. Finally, as the crisis deepens by the hour, the Home Office has misjudged both the sheer scale of the refugee crisis and the public mood in Britain. It has failed to move with the rapidly changing situation on the ground. Initially the Home Office said that its primary focus was on helping Ukraine's neighbouring countries to cope with an influx of refugees, insisting that the government in Kyiv did not want western states to encourage mass resettlement schemes for fear that Ukrainians would not return to rebuild their country after the war. But as the Russian bombardments became increasingly barbaric and inhumane, the initial exodus quickly escalated to become Europe's biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. Britain's offer to Ukrainians has opened up by only a fraction. Ministers have been struck by the strength of anger from some Conservative MPs willing publicly to vent their anger at Britain's lack of generosity. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, repeatedly deflected blame for the refugee policy on to Patel when questioned by MPs on Monday. The following day Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, insisted ""I am not the home secretary"" when it was his turn to face MPs. Yesterday Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, piled on further pressure by admitting that ""lessons will be learnt"" by Britain's response to the crisis. Today The Times reveals that Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has also become increasingly frustrated with the low number of refugees being given sanctuary in the UK. If this does not increase rapidly in the days ahead, Patel's future will again become one of the main topics of discussion in Westminster.",Broadsheet,1,2022-03,0,Policy

Prince William, who this month went unannounced on to the streets of London to sell The Big Issue, said that he wanted to ""shine a spotlight"" on the issue of homelessness. William, cover star of the magazine's latest issue, wrote in an article: ""While I may seem like one of the most unlikely advocates for this cause, I have always believed in using my platform to help tell those stories and to bring attention and action to those who are struggling. I plan to do that now I'm turning 40, even more than I have in the past. ""So, for my part, I commit to continue doing what I can to shine a spotlight on this solvable issue not just today, but in the months and years to come."" He said that he would also tell his children about homelessness in the same way that his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, first took him to a homeless centre in London called The Passage when he was a boy. ""I was 11 when I first visited a homeless shelter with my mother, who in her own inimitable style was determined to shine a light on an overlooked, misunderstood problem. ""In the years ahead, I hope to bring George, Charlotte and Louis to see the fantastic organisations doing inspiring work to support those most in need - just as my mother did for me."" William, who described his time selling The Big Issue as ""eye opening"", went out with Dave Martin, 60, a regular vendor who normally sells the magazine in Hammersmith, west London. Wearing a red vendor's vest and baseball cap and official accreditation on his chest, the duke joined Martin outside a Sainsbury's Local in Victoria, a tenminute walk from Buckingham Palace. People quickly recognised him and word soon spread. But anyone wanting a selfie with the future king had to buy a copy of the magazine first. The outing was not publicised by Kensington Palace, although the news soon emerged online. In less than an hour they sold 32 copies. ""How long would it take for you to sell those normally?"" William asked. About half a week, Martin told him. Later, in a conversation between the two of them for the magazine, Martin said: ""When are we going to do this again? We'll do 50 next time, at least!"" William replied: ""Honestly, I really enjoyed it. Thank you for looking after me. When you first do it, I can see it's daunting. You just don't quite know what's going to happen or how it's going to go."" He added: ""I really enjoyed it. I could have spent many more hours out there with you."" During his time on the streets William chatted to a number of people who had fled the war in Ukraine and he told the magazine: ""We met two Ukrainian refugees. The daughter lives here, she's brought her mum from Kyiv. Sadly they've lost a number of family members and most of their property. The grandmother is still out there. ""And then there was another gentleman who undid his shirt like Superman with a Ukrainian logo on there. He's got his whole family over here and they've lost everything. From Mariupol."" In the question-and-answer session, William suggested that momentum for tackling homelessness, fostered by the Everyone In initiative in which rough sleepers were moved into accommodation at the start of the pandemic, may have been lost but he remained optimistic. He told Martin, a Big Issue seller for 11 years: ""I felt my birthday was a good opportunity. I wanted to make sure were highlighting something that matters to me. ""Off the back of Everyone In, it started to feel that actually, this issue isn't quite as big to tackle as we think. But it feels like it's gone back to what it was before the pandemic.

3930,urc_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,16/4/2022,450 words,Mehreen Khan,Inflation in the eurozone 'will double this year',"Inflation in the eurozone is expected to double to 6 per cent this year, according to a key survey of forecasters, putting further pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. The ECB's quarterly survey of economists and forecasters revealed a doubling in inflation expectations from an average of 3 per cent to 6 per cent in 2022, three times the central bank's target rate. The findings make up part of the ECB's calculations over whether expectations for future inflation are anchored around its 2 per cent target. Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, has warned that the war in Ukraine means inflationary pressures have ""intensified"" in the short run, but she has failed to commit to a strict end-date for the bank's mass bond-buying, which she had said previously would halt in the third quarter of this year. Lagarde said after the ECB's April governing council meeting that a rise in market and survey-based inflation expectations ""warranted close monitoring"", as they could help to drive prices higher throughout the economy. The forecasters' survey also revised up next year's projected inflation from 1.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent and kept 2024's forecast unchanged at 1.8 per cent. Longer-term inflation expectations rose from 2 per cent to 2.1 per cent. Investors are pencilling in at least two rate rises from the ECB this year, marking the first tightening of monetary policy since the bloc's sovereign debt crisis erupted in 2011. The central bank has said that it will first end its mass bond purchases and will begin to raise rates ""some time after"". Market expectations suggest that September and December are the most likely dates. The survey suggested that inflation, which hit 7.5 per cent in the eurozone last month, may be showing signs of peaking after record rises in the prices of food, energy and commodities after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The European Union's economy is heavily exposed to the effects of the war, given the bloc's reliance on Russian energy imports and the humanitarian costs associated with millions of Ukrainian refugees fleeing west across European borders. Lagarde said that the reimposition of lockdowns in some Chinese cities was adding to cost pressures by causing further disruption to global supply chains. The forecasters' survey downgraded eurozone economic growth from 4.2 per cent to 2.9 per cent this year and to 2.3 per cent next year. The euro fell to a new low for the year against the dollar after Lagarde's remarks.

Scilt, Scotland's national centre for languages run by the University of Strathclyde, has published resources for pupils starting school in mid-August. Teachers and hosts have also been told to be vigilant for Ukrainian children who may be neglected because their parents are too distressed to care for them. Some teachers are trying to learn Ukrainian, a language rarely heard in Scottish schools previously. There were only 23 Ukrainian speakers in Scottish schools in 2010, the last time the Scottish government published a detailed breakdown. Eight of those were in Glasgow. After 2010, Ukrainian speakers were collated into the rare languages listed as ""other"". Fiona Normansell, a language teacher in South Ayrshire, has published a video on YouTube for Ukrainian refugees on what to expect when they start school in Scotland. The video is translated into Ukrainian using Immersive Reader, an app that translates Microsoft Word documents into foreign languages automatically. Teachers are encouraged to use this app and Microsoft Translator when teaching Ukrainian children, although Normansell acknowledged ""there may be some mistakes"" in her translation. Teachers are also encouraged to use pictures, gestures and sign language. About a third of Ukrainians speak Russian as their first language, particularly those from the eastern border regions. Many more speak Russian as an additional language, although books and broadcasts in Russian were withdrawn after the Maidan revolution in 2014 that replaced Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-backed president, with a more western-leaning government. Russian was one of the fastest-growing languages in Scottish schools before the Ukraine invasion in February and was among the top ten foreign languages last year. In 2010, 479 pupils spoke Russian as their first language, behind the littleknown Malayalam, which is spoken by 3 per cent of Indians. By 2021 Russian speakers had tripled to more than 1,400, on a par with Spanish. The next pupil census, published in March, will reveal the impact that sanctions have had on the number of Russian-speaking pupils in Scottish schools. The Scottish government has produced guidance for hosts of Ukrainian families to help them integrate. It states: ""A small number of people might benefit from crisis mental health input. People may need more specialist help if they have pre-existing mental health conditions, are so upset they cannot care for themselves or their children, feel like they want to hurt themselves or hurt others are not eating or attending to self-care and are expressing suicidal ideas or plans."" Teachers and hosts concerned about the psychological or mental health needs of a child, adult or family are recommended to seek professional advice. The guidance states that most refugees adapt and build resilience but warns that some may end up ""distressed, upset and not coping well"". It states: ""Distress in this situation is a normal reaction - in adults, distress might come across as anger, panic, sadness, crying and withdrawal."" Hosts are advised to be calm, patient and kind, to respect people's privacy, learn how to pronounce their names correctly and accept that their guests may not initially be able to express gratitude for taking them in. Hosts are advised not to pressurise Ukrainians to talk about their ordeal or judge them for their reactions or emotions.

Despite sponsoring about 35,000 visas for refugees only 4,000 homes have been approved for them to live in. Of the 18,400 Ukrainian refugees who have already arrived with a visa, 6,050 are still living in hotels and cruise ships, according to official figures. During first minister's questions on Thursday Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: ""The first minister boasting about numbers will be cold comfort to those who have been living out of suitcases since February or are coming to the end of a placement with no idea what happens next. ""This isn't a new life, this is a new limbo. And the mobilisations in Russia, and pretend referendums, mean no chance of a quick return."" Nicola Sturgeon responded: ""It is important that we recognise Scotland is more than playing our part.""

Officials warned that refugees fleeing their homeland after Russia's invasion faced sleeping on camp beds unless drastic action was taken. The passenger vessel the MS Victoria will be docked in Leith, Edinburgh, to provide 739 rooms, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the 7,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Scotland. Two thirds of them applied under the super sponsor scheme, launched in March, after the Scottish government committed itself to accommodate at least 3,000 people. In a separate move, North Lanarkshire council said it would refurbish 200 unused council tower block properties, funded by £5 million from the Scottish government, to provide longer-term accommodation. The Wheatley Group, Scotland's largest social landlord, has pledged to make 300 homes available to councils to help displaced people from Ukraine. Although officially ""paused"" for three months, a document released by the Scottish government to justify the decision suggested longer-term issues. The paper stated it had been hoped that ""the crisis in Ukraine would prove temporary and that a peace agreement could swiftly be reached"". Scotland's temporary accommodation sector is at capacity, the document said, adding: ""If numbers continue at this level, local authorities may find themselves having to house displaced people, including families, in emergency contingency accommodation such as camp beds in community settings. Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, the Scottish and Welsh first ministers, had said that there would be no cap on the schemes' numbers. Gary Gray of the volunteer group ScotHosts said: ""Placing families into accommodation that was due for demolition and an old cruise liner that was probably for scrap is in no way the proper and humane way to treat refugees."" He said he stepped back from having anything to do with the Scottish government's programme a month ago after becoming ""disgusted by the shoddy way that everyone in authority was handling it"" and predicting that the scheme would have to be paused. The Scottish government said that 21,256 visas had been issued naming a Scottish sponsor, which is more than 20 per cent of the UK total and the highest number per head of population across Britain and Northern Ireland. Neil Gray, Scottish minister with responsibility for the refugees, has asked Lord Harrington of Watford, the UK minister for refugees, if the British government would consider introducing its own super sponsor arrangements. Behind the story The press release outlining Nicola Sturgeon's plan to introduce a ""super sponsor"" scheme for Ukrainian refugees hammered home its intention in the accompanying note to Michael Gove, then UK housing secretary (Kieran Andrew writes). ""The letter makes clear that no cap will be set by Scotland and Wales on the numbers of refugees they will welcome,"" it said. Given the Scottish parliament has no powers over immigration, foreign affairs or defence, it is limited in what it can do. Finding homes for the displaced is one way it could help. Yes, the aims were laudable, but was the infrastructure in place? Housing families on a repurposed cruise ship and in tower blocks earmarked for demolition suggests not. It is true that the Scottish government originally banked on receiving 3,000 refugees and 7,000 have arrived but it was Sturgeon who said there was no limit on how many Scotland could welcome.
