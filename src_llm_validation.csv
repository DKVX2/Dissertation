The capital Budapest was on the brink of civil disorder as refugees protested at the closure of international Keleti station - following clashes between migrants earlier in the day. The station was later reopened to other passengers sparking a protest by around 1,000 people, mostly fleeing war-torn Syria, and travelling to Munich or Vienna. Around 100 police formed a blockade as people tried to storm on to trains to the West. The chaos came as the Europe's refugee crisis deepened last night. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the UK should offer refugee status to ""a few thousand people"" from Syria but cannot be an open door. He said: ""The problem we've got is, potentially, we've opened the door to an exodus of biblical proportions, meaning millions and millions of people. ""We've lost sight of what is a genuine refugee. How many millions does Europe want to take? That really is the question."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The problem we have now is if you look at the definition of the EU's asylum policy, it includes anybody who comes from a war-torn country - and it even includes people leaving extreme poverty. ""The EU has sent the message that anybody who comes across the Mediterranean or Turkey - once they have set foot in an EU country they will be accepted. That's a message to hundreds of thousands of people."" Hungary has become the flashpoint of the European migrant crisis as the primary gateway to the EU through the Balkans. After the clashes yesterday, officials announced there would be no trains leaving for Austria or Germany until further notice. Last night, Hungary's defence ministry said up to 3,500 soldiers could be sent to the southern border with Serbia to help with the refugee crisis.

271,src_dailyexpress_raw.docx,Daily Express,14/5/2016,323 words,Alison Little,New refugee crisis fear as visas-for-Turks talks falter,"THE EU deal with Turkey to ease the migrant crisis is feared to be on the brink of collapse. Turkey's EU minister Volkan Bozkir said yesterday talks on giving his countrymen visa-free travel in Europe's passport-free Schengen zone as soon as next month had reached stalemate. He said: ""I am not very optimistic about the outcome of the talks we held in Brussels today. ""It's essential that the European Commission finds a new formula."" The warning came after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accused the EU of setting new hurdles for his country. One of 72 conditions Brussels has set is that Turkey narrows its definition of terrorism. Critics claim Ankara is using terror laws to stifle legitimate dissent and press freedom. But the government argued that it needs the powers to fight Kurdish and Islamic State attacks. Turkey said yesterday that eight of its soldiers and 22 militants had been killed in clashes in the past two days in the Kurddominated south-east. Mr Erdogan has ruled out any return to talks with the separatists PKK and has vowed to crush the group seeking autonomy. Tension with the EU now threatens to scupper the deal under which Europe offers Turkey visa-free travel to Schengen countries - which do not include Britain - and cash to help with the thousands of Syrian refugees who have fled over its border. Turkey is also being offered faster talks on joining the EU. The package is in return for Turkey taking back those who arrive on the Greek islands. For every refugee returned to Turkey, the EU will resettle a Syrian already in Turkey, as part of efforts to deter refugees risking their lives crossing the sea. EU border agency Frontex said yesterday that the numbers arriving in Greece dropped 90 per cent last month compared with March, seen as a sign that the deal with Turkey was working. About 2,700 people arrived in Greece from Turkey last month, mostly from Syria, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Asylum applications shot up from 22,640 in 2010 to 31,260 last year - a rise of 38 per cent. In total Britain received 137,660 claims over the period - although not all succeeded. The refugee agency UNHCR released the figures as it announced that the number of people seeking asylum in developed countries has hit a 22-year peak. An estimated 866,000 lodged claims last year - a 45 per cent rise in a year - driven by the spiralling conflicts in Syria and Iraq and the highest point since the start of the war in Bosnia. Of the 44 developed nations, Germany last year received the most asylum applications at 173,000 - 30 per cent of the EU total. It was followed by the US (121,160), Turkey (87,820), Sweden (75,090) and Italy (63,360). Britain was eighth on the list. The country took in 2,400 Syrian refugees last year, with another 260 referred by the UNHCR. Refugees from Pakistan formed the largest group seeking refuge in the UK - a total of 3,884 - followed by those from war-torn African state of Eritrea (3,271) and Iran (2,450). © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2015-03,1,Migration
220,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,29/7/2017,1757 words,NA,OVERWHELMED. ABANDONED,"THE EU. IS ITALY ABOUT TO TRIGGER THE MIGRANT NUCLEAR OPTION? BY SUE REID ON THE ITALIAN /AUSTRIAN BORDER On a farm track outside the huge migrants' camp hidden away among cornfields near Venice, a young Nigerian is telling me of his hopes for a new life. With pink varnish on his nails and a paisley bandana on his head, he does a Michael Jackson-style shimmy under the searing July sun. Osarume Ehiz, 16, has lived in the camp with 1,000 other male migrants, many of them fellow Nigerians, for 11 months. I'm a dancer,' he says, eyes sparkling and his feet moving fast in his white plastic sandals. But I can't make a career in Italy. I'm waiting for a special visa, so I can go anywhere in Europe. I hope the paperwork will come soon.' The special visa' he refers to is at the centre of a furious row that is dividing EU governments and escalating border tensions as the continent struggles to cope with the biggest migration crisis since World War II. Earlier this month, Italy, which because of its geographical position is bearing the brunt of a huge influx of migrants from Africa, threatened to disperse them by providing EU temporary visas to up to 200,000. The move would let thousands of migrants many of whom have made the treacherous and illegal journey by sea on flimsy boats from Libya spread across the rest of Europe. It follows growing anger in Italy that other EU nations have reneged on promises to help with the migrant crisis engulfing the country. Up to 95,000 people have arrived on Italian shores so far this year. Last weekend alone, several thousand were rescued and brought into port by naval vessels and charity boats. Italian PM Paolo Gentiloni's contentious plan would allow visa holders to travel freely into Austria and beyond. Austria has retaliated by threatening to close its key Alpine border with Italy, at the Brenner Pass, and enforce it with tanks and troops. Its foreign minister, Sebastian Kurz, has said that being saved in the Mediterranean cannot be connected with a ticket to Central Europe'. To say emotions are running high between the two countries is an understatement, but the stand-off reflects hardening public opinion across the EU about levels of migration and the pathetic response from politicians to what is, arguably, the greatest issue of our times. Under the EU's migrant quota scheme, all member countries are meant to accept a mandatory share of migrants whose landing point is Italy. But the growing realisation, as confirmed by the UN, that most of the current influx of migrants are no longer Syrian refugees fleeing civil war or Islamic State horror, but economic desperados from countries including Bangladesh, Guinea as well as Nigeria, is having an impact. Even the European Commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, recently admitted that most migrants are not escaping persecution but simply searching for a better life. Poland and Hungary are jibbing at taking in migrants (citing cultural difficulties in view of the fact that many are Muslim and both countries have strong Christian traditions), while the Czech Republic is dragging its feet, too. So in this febrile atmosphere, Italy's border with Austria has become a potential flashpoint. And, as I witnessed this week, few migrants seem to be in need of special visas as they cross with apparent ease from one country desperate to be rid of them to another which is no more welcoming. Italy is the major recipient of migrants and refugees on the Central Mediterranean Route from Libya. It now takes in far more than Greece, where the numbers arriving have fallen thanks to a deal negotiated with Turkey last year at a cost of several billion euros to the EU. (Turkey agreed to take back those migrants who had travelled from the Middle East and elsewhere, via Turkey, and then across the Aegean Sea to Greece, but who did not qualify for asylum in the EU.) Increasingly, migrant holding camps, which have been set up all over Italy, are close to overflowing. The young Nigerian I met this week, Osarume Ehiz, who gets 75 a month from the Italian government if he stays in the camp, says conditions are dreadful. I live in a room with ten others in bunk beds,' he complains. There are mosquitos, the food is uneatable and we get no education. Italy is a bad country. The clothes they give us are unusable, so I buy mine from the market stalls.' Every day, like other migrants at his camp, a former military base in Bagnoli di Sopri, he uses a charity bike to cycle around the countryside, simply for something to do. The Italians in the villages don't say “hello” to us. They are not rude, but avoid our eyes. I think it is because we are black,' he adds. Four miles away at another camp housing 2,000 migrants in the village of Conetta, it is much the same story. There, the 190 locals feel overwhelmed. Some have got fed up and, at one stage, put up protest messages scrawled on sheets in the village square. One said simply: Repatriate the migrants.' The local mayor Albero Panfilio said it was wrong to squash human beings together with no hope for the future. I call the camp a human warehouse. The migrants arrive, the authorities don't know where to put them, so they dump them here. They are treated like garbage.' Certainly, the Italian public is losing patience. In an appalling but telling scenario in January, a migrant drowned in the Grand Canal in Venice as passers-by watched but did little to help. There were even ugly shouts of Go home' and Let him die'. Patel Sabelly, a Gambian in his 20s, had jumped to his death from a bridge after reaching Italy by boat from Libya and being refused asylum. Although the Mayor of Venice, Luigi Brugnaro, in a gesture of respect, paid for the man's funeral out of his own pocket, his statement at the time was in tune with public attitudes and officials' frustration. We can't continue to nurture the hopes of half the world of coming to Italy,' he said. It is impossible for our country to continue managing such a large-scale phenomenon in the way it has done so far.' Meanwhile, Austria is still reeling from the impact of the 2015 migrant influx when Angela Merkel controversially opened Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants. Of the million or so heading for Germany, 90,000 decided to stay in Austria as they passed through. In this fiercely nationalistic nation, politicians and the people were soon saying enough is enough'. The burka has been banned by Austria, compulsory German lessons introduced for migrants, and after a spate of attacks across the EU on women in public places, signs have gone up in Arabic at a market town near Vienna, telling male migrants not to touch female bathers or follow them into swimming pool changing rooms. This week, I observed migrants on their way from those camps in Bagnoli di Sopri and Conetta, near Venice, up to the town of Brenner marking the border with Austria. I followed them to Innsbruck, a major city and popular ski resort which hosted the 1976 Winter Olympics. It was clear this is a well-used route for migrants, many of whom refuse to stay in the Italian camps more than 24 hours, walking out after a meal and a shower. They are anxious to avoid being fingerprinted and escape being tangled up in the Italian asylum system, preferring to take their chances in northern Europe. Their journey often begins in the pretty Italian town of Bolzano, about 50 miles south of Brenner, where trains go to Innsbruck. Outside the railway station, I met Musa, 23, from Guinea, who arrived by boat from Libya seven months ago. I am sad and tired,' he tells me. Europe is not what I hoped for. I sleep on the streets and now I am going to Austria.' No Italian official intervened as he bought a ticket for Innsbruck and boarded a train. When trains arrive at Brenner, there appear to be no onboard checks. Indeed, on Wednesday and Thursday this week, the only visible security at the border was an Italian army truck. Its three occupants occasionally got out to stretch their legs and at one stage could be seen pointing the way to migrants who preferred to simply walk into Austria. Other migrants sat on benches outside the station, waiting for trains, eating hot dogs and sending messages on their phones. One, a 23-year-old from the Ivory Coast, told me he expected to be in Innsbruck by nightfall. It is easy,' he said laughing. No one likes to stay in Italy when there are opportunities further north in Austria, Sweden, Germany and Britain.' Inside Brenner station, another trio of Italian soldiers walked along the platform as an Innsbruck-bound train rolled in. Migrants boarded under their noses and were soon leaving Italy. At Innsbruck's main station, I saw migrants newly arrived from Italy being greeted by a Somalian called Hussein, 30, who has lived in Austria for five years. They come in all the time, every day and at all times of the day,' he told me. I take them to the mosque across the road. They often need clothes, food and help. The Italians turn a blind eye. They see the migrants on the platform back at the Brenner Pass and say “go now” when the train for Austria comes. It's not only the trains, there are cars and trucks, too. If a migrant has money to give a trafficker, then it is easy as there are no regular road checks into Austria either.' If the Italian government's threat of special visas becomes a reality, then this constant stream of migrants towards the Austrian border may well become a deluge. Adding to the sense of crisis, this week the European Court of Justice endorsed an important EU law that requires migrants to seek asylum in the first EU country they reach, overruling arguments that it is not equipped to deal with the huge numbers of migrants arriving in Italy. So might this be the tipping point for the Italian government? Only time will tell, but Mattia Toaldo, senior analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, fears the worst. He recently warned that Italy's threat to assist the onward journey of migrants with temporary EU visas was a nuclear option'. Italians had lost all hope of getting help from the EU,' he said, and might yet tell Brussels: If you won't make migration a common challenge [for all the member nations], then we will.' This week, looking at dispirited, overstretched Italy struggling to cope, it's difficult not to have sympathy if that is the incendiary path this nation chooses to take with awesome consequences for its neighbours and beyond.

57,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,7/9/2015,714 words,NA,AID CASH TO FUND SYRIANS IN BRITAIN,"AT LAST, CHUNK OF VAST FOREIGN BUDGET IS DIVERTED TO HELP PAY HOUSING COSTS HERE BY JACK DOYLE POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT MILLIONS of pounds from the foreign aid budget will be spent in Britain to pay the costs of supporting Syrian migrants here, George Osborne said yesterday. The decision marks a major change in how the controversial budget will be used. Critics have long claimed that huge sums of aid cash are being squandered - especially as the Government's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid means the money available will keep rising as the economy thrives. However, Chancellor said part of the budget will now go to town halls to ease' the pressure on public services of the new arrivals instead of going into development projects abroad. It represents the first step in what he called a fundamental rethink' of aid which will see all additional spending - expected to total some £1billion by 2020 - diverted into responding to major crises. Mr Osborne said aid money should go to the big threats facing Britain'. It could mean vast tranches of aid money set aside to deal with emergencies as they arise, including natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis as well as civil war, famine and disease. It is hoped he decision to use cash from the ballooning £12billion aid budget to pay for new arrivals will calm public fears about even more migrants coming to the country at a time of spending cuts and record immigration levels. Mr Osborne said there would be an assessment of what our public services and our infrastructure can support'. The scheme will particularly focus on bringing in orphaned children who have fled the civil war, he said. The announcement came as: ? Cheering crowds welcomed migrants arriving in Germany on trains with toys and chocolate; ? The Pope called for Roman Catholics in Europe to shelter refugees fleeing death from war and hunger'; ? Greece sent troops to the island of Lesbos after new clashes between migrants, locals and police; ? A convoy of cars driven by German and Austrian activists crossed into Hungary to pick up migrants attempting to reach the West; ? Hungary relaxed restrictions on train services, and took several thousand people to the Austrian border by bus. Today David Cameron will give the House of Commons further details of the Government's response to the refugee crisis, amid expectations up to 10,000 Syrians could be brought to Britain from refugee camps. Officials dismissed reports the number could be as high as 15,000. A survey showed the public's lack of enthusiasm for thousands more coming in. The Mail on Sunday poll found nearly one in three people said Britain should not accept any Syrian migrants on top of existing asylum seekers. One in six said Britain should take less than 1,000. Britain is already comfortably the biggest European contributor of aid cash to the Syrian crisis. The extra £100million promised by Mr Cameron last week will bring the total to £1billion. Much has gone to refugee camps. Mr Osborne told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: The foreign aid budget … could help the local councils with things like housing costs. Understandably people here ask about the pressure on public services - we'll have extra money to help local authorities deal with that.' He added: In the short-term we're going to take more refugees, but not in a way that encourages them on to these dangerous boats. In the longer term, I think we need a fundamental rethink of our aid policy, so yes, we support reducing poverty but we also direct our additional aid spending to these failed states, to this refugee crisis, to the big threats facing Britain. So the question in the spending review is not just how does our aid budget help the rest of the world, but how does it help Britain's national interest.' Revelations about wasteful aid projects, corruption, donation to countries with their own aid budgets and even space programmes have increased public opposition to growing aid spending at a time of cuts at home. Officials said all the additional spending over the coming years will be ringfenced for use on global challenges' such as the Syrian refugee crisis.  That could means some £1billion diverted to responding to major international crises by the end of the decade. Comment - Page 16 © Daily Mail",Tabloid,1,2015-09,1,Aid
12,src_dailymail_raw.docx,Daily Mail,15/10/2015,685 words,BY JAMES SLACK AND IAN DRURY,OUTRAGE AS UN SAYS BRITAIN'S REFUGEES POLICY IS LIKE 1930S,"A SENIOR UN official triggered outrage last night by comparing Britain's response to the Syrian refugee crisis to decisions taken in 1938 which he claimed paved the way for the Holocaust. Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said the rhetoric being used by politicians in the UK and elsewhere in Europe had echoes of the years leading up to the Second World War. He said that at the 1938 Evian Conference - called to discuss the growing number of Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution - politicians turned their backs on German and Austrian Jews on the grounds that taking them in would destabilise their societies. This reluctance, he claimed, helped Hitler to conclude extermination could be an alternative to deportation. Mr Al Hussein - who appeared to take a swipe at both Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May - said the same arguments were being used today. He said: It's just a political issue that is being ramped up by those who can use the excuse of even the smallest community as a threat to the sort of national purity of the state. Closer examination of what happened in Europe in the early part of the 20th century should make people think very carefully about what they're saying. Why is there so much amnesia? Why don't they distil from experience that they've been down this road before and it's a very unhappy road.' Tory MPs said the comments were offensive' and appalling'. Mr Al Hussein also said the use of terms such as swarms of refugees' - language used by Mr Cameron in relation to the Calais immigration crisis - were deeply regrettable. In an interview published by the Guardian newspaper, the Jordanian took aim at comments by Mrs May that uncontrolled immigration made it impossible to build a cohesive society'. Asked whether he believed Mrs May would also come to regret her choice of words, he added: These are human beings: even in the use of the word migrants, somehow it's as if they don't have rights. They all have rights just as we have rights.' Tory MP Andrew Percy said: The idea that the debate around the Syrian issue could in any way be similar to Nazi persecution of the Jews is offensive. This kind of comparison is so overblown and so disgusting it undermines a sensible debate on how to address the migration crisis. The UN would be much better targeting the massive human rights abuses in parts of the world where their members are committing them.' Sir Bill Cash, a veteran Tory backbencher, said: These remarks are abhorrent. It is an obscene comparison to make which is totally unjustified. There are realities that have to be faced up to, and these include the fact that we have to distinguish between real refugees acquiring asylum and economic migrants or those who might be hidden jihadis.' Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: I entirely reject any characterisation that this country does not have a proud record of welcoming refugees or showing compassion in these circumstances. When I look at the £1.1billion we have targeted at those in most need, those fleeing persecution, to give them hope, it is that sense of compassion and focus that this Government has demonstrated, helping hundreds of thousands of people.' During Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Cameron also defended the Government's record on Syria and its pledge to take 20,000 refugees over the next five years. He told MPs: We are the second largest bilateral donor to Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, in Lebanon and in Turkey. We have done more than almost any other country to help Syrian refugees.' It is the latest in a string of political attacks on Britain by the UN. In July, the special representative on migration, Peter Sutherland, said Britain's xenophobic' response to Calais was being exaggerated beyond belief' to inflame tensions in regard to the number of people coming into Britain'. And in May, Francois Crepeau, the UN's special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, said Britain risks taking the path of Nazi Germany if it pulls out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

EARLY last year, I spent 10 days at a UN refugee camp in Kurdistan, northern Iraq, where 8,000 Kurds sought refuge from the civil war raging in Syria. They were fleeing the Assad regime's assault on their identity and livelihood, but reluctantly. These were not economic migrants - they lived in brick houses, drove cars and held down professional jobs. IS had not been heard of… My job, for a fantastic Italian charity EPOS was to provide political education to the refugees - why were they there, what could they do, how could they contribute? We ran classes every day in big tents. We employed refugees as assistants, interpreters and tutors. We explored citizenship, human rights, the risks of human trafficking, community organising, campaigning. First, they explained, after shelter and clean water (we were in a bleak featureless desert 50 miles from the main town), they wanted iPhone chargers. frustrated Then they campaigned for a secondary school since the UN only provided a primary facility and the teenagers were becoming restive, frustrated and angry. It is now built and working well. Third, they debated whether to build a mosque or was that creating too much stability? Some remembered the Palestinians who had been living as refugees in Damascus for 50 years. They wanted to go home. One day, a young girl explained she was dipping back across the border, to now famous Kobane, to attend an exam. Another older man apologised for missing my social media class because he had to go home to plant seeds for the next harvest. When the lights failed, as they often did, I called a halt to the day's classes but they begged me to continue, turning their phones upwards to illuminate the dingy tent. They drew pictures for me when I left. Would I take them in to my house now? Of course. Do I think they want to flee across Europe to our islands? No. Do I think they need encouragement and support? Yes, of course. Graphic   VIEWPOINT Quintin Oliver",Tabloid,0,2015-09,1,Conditions
463,src_dailymirror_raw.docx,Daily Mirror,15/12/2017,1089 words,LAURA CONNOR,"Like on BGT, I ask these kids 'What's your dream?' They all say the same…to go home and feel like children again; AMANDA HOLD DEN VISITS SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP EXCLUSIVE","Watching groups of kids battling it out on stage as they performed their best dance moves, songs and magic tricks was like any other day at work on Britain's Got Talent for Amanda Holden. Just as she does when she judges the ITV show, Amanda asked the youngsters what they would do with their cash prize if they won the competition. But these children did not light up at the thought of going on holiday or helping their local community centres. These kids just wanted their lives back. Because Amanda was watching a very different version of the talent show, one based in a camp housing Syrian refugees who have dodged bombs, bullets and sexual slavery in a desperate bid to flee their war-ravaged homes. Amanda says: ""I basically treated it like the show and joked around with them saying, 'What's your dream?' and, 'The next two minutes will change your life'. The response was like a movie. ""Literally every child kept saying the same thing, 'We want to go back to Syria, we just want to rebuild our homes, we just want our childhoods back, we just want to feel like children again'. ""And obviously that's not a prize that will ever be available to them."" They called the show Zaatari's Got Talent after the refugee camp in Jordan where they now live. There was a banner, judging table and a bell instead of a buzzer. Amanda, 46, says: ""They were so, so good. ""There was a boys' choir who sang a song for Syria and, even though it was in a different language, I understood the sentiment and the song because you could see the emotion in their faces. ""I thought to myself, 'I need to tell Simon Cowell that we need to get a camera into this camp'."" Amanda spent two days in Jordan, visiting the Zaatari camp 25 miles from the Syrian border and the Makani centre in Amman where children get psychological support to help them cope with the trauma they have experienced. Mum-of-two Amanda spoke to 13-year-old Rasha, who fled from her hometown, the Syrian capital Damascus, after her school was hit by a bomb when she was just eight years old. Rasha was in the playground with her best friend when the blast struck. Most of the boys playing football around her were killed - but that was not the worst of it. She saw her best friend with horrendous head injuries, the blood splattering across Rasha's face. Rasha was so traumatised she stood still for a week, stupefied by the death that was now part of her everyday life. But that was not the end of the terror for Rasha. She later saw her mother electrocuted by soldiers and her two brothers were shot. Rasha herself was brutally dragged by her hair and hurled against a wall by soldiers. Her mum suffered numerous strokes as a result of the torture and trauma she endured and now does not recognise Rasha, her youngest child. As Amanda places a sympathetic hand on Rasha's knee, the teenager asked her: ""How can I ever be happy? I've lost everything. I smile, but inside I'm crying. I feel so much pain inside. ""Not only have I lost my friends, but I have lost my mum, who doesn't recognise me, and my family is separated as half my family are in Syria."" Amanda, who was visiting Jordan in October with Save the Children as part of their Christmas Jumper Day appeal, struggled to compred hend the barbarity these children have witnessed. In 2011, she and husband Chris Hughes were devastated when their son was stillborn. She described her grief as ""overwhelming"". Just a year later, she almost died herself giving birth to her youngest daughter Hollie. But the refugee camp was beyond anything Amanda had ever experienced before. She says: ""Obviously I have had my fair share of trauma. But after seeing these people I said, 'Nothing is as important - whether it's a new haircut, or a new car - as my kids' health, my husband, my parents and my family."" We're all alive and love each other and we're together. It made pain inside me think, 'Every woman in the world is a tiger when it comes to protecting and looking after their own children'."" There was one story which really hit home. Hadeel is also a mum of two, and her 11-year-old daughter Ayla is struggling to overcome shyness - just like Amanda's own daughter Lexi, also 11 But the cause of Ayla's shyness is horrific. The trauma of seeing soldiers threaten her family when she was just six years old left Ayla perpetually afraid for her life and struggling to speak. Hadeel, also mum to Yana, eight, was attacked by armed soldiers and frequently saw dead bodies lying in pools of blood on the streets. Ayla was in the camp for year before she had the confidence to speak again. She found the courage to perform a heartfelt song for Amanda, having seen BGT on smartphones. Amanda says: ""They were an amazing family. I really related to Hadeel as she has two daughters too and her daughter had to overcome a great amount of shyness, like Lexi. ""I said to Hadeel, 'How do you find the strength?' And she replied, 'You just have to, as a mother'."" The visit carried on affecting Amanda even when she returned to the UK. She says: ""We get to leave, we get to go and have a hot shower and settle down for the evening. I couldn't stop thinking about that. I felt immensely guilty that I had the choice to do that. ""This time of year it's freezing and their heating consists of big oil drums filled with fire. They are no longer in their homes with their families at Christmas. They literally have nothing."" Amanda found it tough telling Lexi and Hollie, five, about her trip. She bought two dresses for her girls from tailor Faris, 17, who works in the Makani centre. His work must sustain his family of eight, after his father died in Syria. Amanda says: ""These kids learn a lot of skills to prevent them from being taken as sex slaves and all the other horrendous things that can happen. ""Hollie loves her dress. But she couldn't even get her head around the fact that some of these children don't have their mummies and daddies."" But Amanda did take positives from her experience. She says: ""It was amazing to see the sense of community in the camp. The joy inside those buildings in Jordan is overwhelming. ""That sense of family is everything.

347,src_dailymirror_raw.docx,Daily Mirror,22/3/2017,727 words,TREVOR QUINN,The welcome is great and we feel very safe...; Syrian refugees delighted to begin their new life in Ireland EXCLUSIVE,"THERE was relief yesterday among 72 Syrian refugees who were given a warm welcome as they began a new life in Ireland. The men, women and children, some of whom had lost loved ones in the bitter conflict, arrived at a former hotel in Ballaghaderreen, Co Roscommon, which has been transformed into an emergency reception centre. Justice Department officials told local representatives in January about the plans to transform what was the Abbeyfield Hotel. There had been concerns over the capacity of the town to cope with the arrivals, but yesterday there was a real appreciation from the refugees who were delighted by their welcome. Mum of two Jenan Hussein, in her early 30s, said she felt happy to be in Ireland and had often felt lucky simply to wake up every day before her family left Syria early last year. Through an interpreter she added: ""I went to sleep every night in the hope of waking up the next day. I felt like I died 10 times and passed away from all of the bombing."" Jenan travelled to Ireland with her mother Seham, daughters Ahman, nine, Judi, six and 19-year-old nephew Ghasan after almost a year in Greece. Syria has been ravaged by civil war since 2011 with several factions and foreign belligerents involved. The most recent estimate by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research puts the death toll at 470,000. It's thought 10.9 million people (about half of the population) were displaced and 3.8 million made refugees. Welcome banners were placed in the former Abbeyfield Hotel as locals, Irish Refugee Protection Programme officials and orientation staff greeted the visitors with a guard of honour. The new arrivals, more than half of whom are children, will stay for six months at the centre before being settled in other parts of the country. They have six computers which they can use as an internet hub to contact relatives at home, while Moroccan chef Ali Derazzi will cook halal meals for the families. ""Welcome packs"" of essentials including nappies, wipes, toiletries and baby wipes have been provided by local chemists, Molloys and Murphys, while book shops have donated books in Arabic. Seham Hussein, 62, looked very content and relaxed as he watched the younger members of her family settling in. To see the welcomed us is We are very She said: ""The reception, the people, everything was very welcoming. SEHAM ROSCOMMON, ""I am very happy to get out of war. I feel very settled and I'm willing to settle even more. ""To see how the Irish have welcomed us is great and we feel very Irish safe and secure. We are hoping for a better future ahead. ""We just registered and we said we wanted to be relocated to another foreign country [after Greece] because we can't go back to Syria obviously. ""We wanted a country that would accept us and to make us feel like we used to feel in our home country. We are very happy."" Asked about what she h d had heard about Ballaghaderreen, she said: ""I did not know a lot. What I did hear was it was a quieter place but all I care about is being settled, being secure and being safe. ""When we were in Greece we heard Ireland is a very nice country. The people are lovely and what is most important is to feel welcomed and appreciated."" Seham's grandson Ghasan said his mother and father Roma and Atman were relieved when he left Syria as they were very worried about his future. He said: ""My parents and my brother and sister are still in Syria. I had to leave because the army is compulsory in Syria so I escaped. ""In a year my family will come and join me. I am very happy to be here. I feel like I wasted 11 months in Greece. We were homeless and we had no life. ""I always had the hope of finishing my education and I am very happy I can now do that here. I really like to work in the media in the future."" The Department of Justice requested the refugees were not photographed yesterday. A spokeswoman said some of their relatives in Syria had suffered ""reprisal attacks"" after new arrivals were photographed in their host countries. Shane O'Connor of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme said: ""There are challenges when you are opening a new centre. ""The centre has to comply with fire regulations and that type of thing but we also need to make it a welcoming place. We need to make it a home."" news@irishmirror.ie ''To see how the Irish welcomed us is great.

The EU country's migrant crisis escalated as police fired tear gas at its main processing centre and the government announced 2,000 ""border hunters"" to reduce the number of people entering. With more than 2,500 migrants crossing from non-EU Serbia on Tuesday alone, pushing the total for the year above 140,000, Hungary's Right-wing ruling party said it wanted to deploy the army. In the village of Roszke, on the border with Serbia and close to the town of Szeged, police fired tear gas at 200 migrants, who became agitated when they were informed that they were to have their fingerprints taken. The mainly Syrian and Afghan migrants fear that, in line with EU rules, if they are stopped later elsewhere in the union they will be returned to Hungary as their official point of entry. ""If I get fingerprinted in Hungary, I don't go to Germany,"" explained Abdul Majed, a 25-year-old language student from Syria. ""We make fingerprints in Germany, so you will be a refugee in Germany, not in Hungary."" Exhausted families trudged along the road through Serbia, hoping to get across the border into Europe, then continue north into the wealthier parts of the continent - such as Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. ""It's been very, very difficult,"" said Odei, a Syrian migrant from Deraa, once he reached Hungary. ""We were here from yesterday. We are very hungry. There's no food, there's no medicine for the children, there's nothing. We are so tired."" Yesterday saw another record day for arrivals, with 2,533 detained - up from 2,093 the previous day. More than 10,000 migrants, including many women with babies and small children, have crossed into Serbia over the past few days and headed toward Hungary - meaning that the records for arrivals will continue to be broken. The government of Hungary, lead by the Right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, has begun construction of a fence, built out of three layers of razor wire, along the border with Serbia in an attempt to stem the flow of arrivals. Mr Orban has ordered that an 11fthigh fence be built along the 110-mile border. It is expected to be completed in the coming days. But it is hardly a formidable barrier. One group of migrants, including women and children, crawled under it yesterday, using blankets, sleeping bags, jackets and a stick to raise the wire. As a police car approached, they dashed through a field. Water cannon will also be sent to Szeged, the largest city in the region. And, as construction of the fence is fi-nalised, helicopters, police dogs, horses and 2,106 extra border patrol officers have been dispatched. Karoly Papp, the chief commissioner of Hungarian police, said the officers ""don't have and will not get an order to shoot"". Zoltan Kovacs, the government spokesman, said parliament would debate next week whether to employ the army in the border effort. A Western Balkan summit will be held in Vienna today, with migration high on the agenda. The EU yesterday released (EURO)1.5 million (£1.1 million) worth of humanitarian aid for refugees in Serbia and Macedonia, on the day that Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, urged countries to show compassion and do ""much more"" to end the crisis. ""Today there are more people displaced than at any time since World War Two,"" said Mr Ban, speaking in Paris. ""In Syria and elsewhere, millions of people flee violence and persecu-tion. Others try to escape poverty and seek ways of living with dignity. ""By our intervention, we must save lives, fight against trafficking and discrimination, bring judicial solutions, examine the profound causes of problems and defend human rights."" The Serbian prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, said yesterday that his country will never close its borders to migrants. He said EU leaders must help frame a plan on how to cope with the influx, but said: ""We speak about desperate people. You cannot stop the flow of life with fences.""

In a growing crisis, the numbers in an encampment just over Jordan's northern border have ""skyrocketed"" in the past two months, according to Red Cross and UN officials. They say the majority have come from territory controlled by a reportedly weakening Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil). Those few who are being let through - many because of medical emergencies - described dire conditions in a desert landscape with no water or supplies other than those provided by aid workers. ""It was a tragedy - hellish,"" said Amira, a 19-year-old from Isilcontrolled Raqqa province, who was allowed through to give birth. ""It was very hot and dirty. You just wanted to die. My blood pressure was dropping all the time,"" she said. She was treated by a doctor from the Red Cross, which won her a permit into Jordan from the local authorities. Amira asked not to give her proper name, saying her family was still at risk. She gave a picture of life under the ""caliphate"" that suggested the crisis will get much worse as Isil rule weakens. She said Isil was becoming more desperate and bloodthirsty. She and her husband, both from a rural area away from Raqqa city, Isil's headquarters, left for fear he would be forcibly recruited as the group ran low on fighters. She said her family were increasingly disgusted by Isil. ""They began slaughtering people in front of us,"" she said. ""They would do it with knives for any reason, if you curse Allah or even something smaller."" Hala Shamlawi, of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the numbers in the camp had ""skyrocketed"", partly as a result of the Russian bombing campaign since September. Aid workers put the number at about 30,000, up from just 3,000 at the end of last year, while the Jordanian government's most recent figure is 26,000. The government insists it is still processing entry permits, at between 50-100 a day, but that it has to protect its own borders. King Abdullah, in a BBC interview last month, said fears of Isil ""elements"" among the refugees had made the issue a ""red line"". Mohammad al-Momani, the information minister, said: ""We have serious concerns that among these people are terrorist organisation infiltrators. If any country would like to take them, we would send them in our own aeroplanes."" He said border guards were allowing aid workers through to help the refugees. Ms Shamlawi added: ""These people are coming mostly from areas controlled by Isil so we understand the Jordanian government's concern. But they are living in dire conditions. There are women and children, and wounded people.""

The Prime Minister has told European leaders that the British public will ""ultimately vote for the status quo"" in a referendum because he will warn of the dangers of leaving, according to reports. The assertions, contained in a leaked memo, appeared at odds with Mr Cameron's insistence yesterday that his approach to the referendum would be ""wholly positive"". Speaking at the conclusion of a Brussels summit, he said he believed Britain's membership of the EU was beneficial and that reforms would make it even more so. He said that his policy of meeting all 27 European leaders to discuss his plans rather than ""kicking over the table"" and making ""immediate demands"" was the right one. But Charles Michel, the prime minister of Belgium, suggested Mr Cameron was not being ""open and frank"" enough and urged him to go beyond ""vague intentions"". The leaked memo was yesterday seized on by Eurosceptics. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said it exposed the Prime Minister's renegotiation strategy as ""one giant con"". The memo, obtained by The Guardian, says that the Prime Minister has the ""firm aim"" of remaining in the EU. It says: ""He believes that people will ultimately vote for the status quo if the alternatives can be made to appear risky."" The Prime Minister apparently suggested ""Angela and Matteo"" - referring to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Matteo Renzi, the Italian Prime Minister - have responded positively to his proposals. It is claimed the French were ""warier"" over reforms to welfare. The note says: ""He [Mr Cameron] said that he needed to win the middle ground and, if he is to achieve this, then moderate people needed to feel that the things that bother them about the EU have been dealt with."" Mr Cameron used the European summit to make his pitch for EU reform, but a row over migrants left him with just five minutes to make his point. One source described it as a ""commercial break"" while legal papers were prepared. The European Council issued a brief, 27-word statement in which it said it would ""revert to the matter in December"". Mr Cameron clashed with EU leaders after he blocked attempts by Germany and Italy to make Britain take migrants from the Mediterranean. He rebuffed attempts to force Britain to take a quota of refugees from the Mediterranean, warning that such an action could encourage more migrants to come. Pressed by Germany, Italy and other nations to accept a share of the 40,000 migrants who have arrived in Europe after fleeing from Syria and Africa, he used Britain's opt-out to block the demands. He later warned that the approach was ""counter-productive"" because it could ""act as a draw"" to come to Europe. Aides insisted that Britain can ""hold its head up"" because it is now taking 1,000 asylum seekers a year after extending a scheme to help Syrian refugees.

Mark Rowley, a Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner, said that Syrian-based terror network has shifted its focus from small-scale attacks on the police and Armed Forces to ""more determined and more ghastly"" atrocities such as those seen last year in Paris and the downing of a passenger jet in Egypt. ""Going from that narrow focus on police and military as symbols of the state to something much broader, and you see a terrorist group which has big ambitions for enormous and spectacular attacks, not just the types that we've seen foiled to date,"" he said. A shared effort to look for any links with Daesh-trained networks that have reached the UK was obviously ""a massively high priority"", he added. The Met announced that any ""marauding"" attack by terrorist gunmen would be publicised on the force's Twitter account to give the public early warning and advice on action to take, which would save lives, officers hope. Meanwhile, under a radical shakeup of migration law planned by Brussels, David Cameron is expected to demand that his European counterparts protect Britain's ability to deport asylum seekers. The European Commission wants to replace the Dublin rule, that allows states to send asylum seekers back to the first state they arrive in, with a system of quotas that will split migrants among the states. Mr Cameron said there is ""no prospect"" of Britain joining a quota system, due to its ""absolutely rock-solid optout"" on common home affairs policy. But diplomats must battle to keep the Dublin powers, which allow the UK to deport 1,000 asylum seekers a year, to avoid an explosive row in the middle of the Brexit debate. Leaders will be presented with four options next Wednesday. A Downing Street source said: ""We've always been clear that we support the Dublin convention. Because it's the system that is the right one in terms of when people arrive in a safe country, that is where they make their asylum claim. We have held that position for a long time."" An EU official admitted the timing clashed with the referendum debate, but said: ""You can't stop doing things because of the UK referendum."" Chris Grayling, the Eurosceptic Leader of the Commons, warned that terrorists could use migration routes to come to Europe, and said that Britain would ""certainly"" be affected by the shake-up. ""There is a very real danger that that safeguard disappears and we end up unable to send asylum seekers back to any country they have come from,"" he said. Meanwhile a study in England found that public opinion is less hostile to immigration than it was five years ago - but that that does not mean welcoming more Syrian refugees. Research for the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate found that the number of people concerned that immigrants could threaten their job has halved from (23 per cent in 2011 to 12 per cent) and the share who see immigration as ""good for the country"" has risen from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. But only 12 per cent thought the Government's plan to take 4,000 Syrian refugees a year was ""too few"", while 43 per cent thought it was too many. 1,000 The number of asylum seekers Britain currently deports each year under the EU's Dublin convention",Broadsheet,1,2016-03,0,Policy

The grand bargain drawn up at a Brussels summit hopes to end deadly Aegean sea crossings and smuggling rackets, while encouraging refugees to stay in Turkish camps by offering them the prospect of a direct flight to the European Union. British taxpayers will pay £500 million in aid, up from an initial £250 million agreed in October, after EU leaders acceeded to Turkey's demand to double its payouts to (EURO)6 billion (£4.6 billion) by the end of 2018. In a host of sweeteners offered to Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish prime minister, new chapters of the long-running talks on Turkey's accession to the EU will be opened. And from June, 77 million Turks will gain access to the EU's Schengen zone for 90 days without a visa, under a significant relaxation of the rules. In exchange, Ankara agreed to ""readmit expeditiously all irregular migrants"" who land on the Greek islands and to station immigration officers on islands including Lesbos, Leros and Kos, according to a leaked draft text. However, senior EU sources told The Daily Telegraph that internal pre-summit assessments had sketched out a best-case scenario of reducing the number arriving in the Greek islands to 1,000 a day. This would be a cut from last Sunday's 2,480 migrants, and the peak last October of 5,600 to 6,000, but still amounts to 30,000 a month - a number that could overwhelm Greece since its northern border was sealed. Greek officials are more pessimistic and think 50,000 a month will still arrive. Turkey was offered an initial (EURO)3 billion payout in October, costing Britain £250 million, and David Cameron is happy to keep on paying after Ankara dramatically hiked its demands. ""If we've got a position where you know we're coping and dealing with the migration challenges, we're clearly going to not turn the tap off on that,"" said a British source. David Davis, the former Conservative shadow home secretary, said: ""We are being held to ransom by the Turkish government. The EU is a very weak negotiator in these matters."" President Racep Tayyip Erdogan yesterday goaded EU leaders. He said in a televised address in Turkey: ""The prime minister is in Brussels right now. I hope he returns with that money, the (EURO)3 billion."" Some 362,000 Syrians claimed asylum in Europe last year, 29 per cent of the total. It suggests that, depending on how far the influx drops, EU states face accommodating tens or even hundreds of thousands of migrants under the one-for-one policy. There are significant questions over how, in practice, migrants who had risked their lives and their savings to reach Greece by boat could be coerced on to deportation flights to Turkish camps. And experts fear the crackdown could open up new, more dangerous routes from Egypt and Tunisia to Italy. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian leader, threatened to veto the one-for-one scheme, warning it would only add ""fuel to the fire"" and cause even more people to come. ""Nothing should be done without the closing of the borders"". Hungary yesterday announced it would cut cash subsidies for asylum seekers and reduce the individual space they are allotted in detention centres to the size given to prison inmates. The Government said the move was to bring their rights into line with citizens, but human rights groups claimed it was simply to drive migrants away. Mr Cameron used the lunch of celery soup and sole to rebuke Mr Davutoglu for his crackdown on press freedom, following the government takeover of the main opposition Zaman newspaper on Friday. It emerged yesterday that nearly 40 clandestine migrants a day, many from the Calais ""Jungle"", were discovered in Dover and the surrounding area last summer. More than 3,600 migrants were picked up by the Home Office between July and September, in the first official indication of the full scale of the impact of the migrant crisis on Britain's border controls. Home Office officials last year repeatedly denied that figures were available on the numbers of migrants - both asylum seekers and illegal immigrants - who had reached British soil concealed in lorries or on Channel Tunnel trains. But figures emerged in a report by Peter Clarke, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, following an inspection of detention facilities at the ports of Dover and Folkestone. William Hague: Page 22 Ocean task force Britain's role in tackling people smugglers Britain's main contribution to the naval force gathered by Nato in the Aegean Sea will be RFA Mounts Bay, a 16,000 ton Landing Ship. This vessel from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary - with a deck of 1,200 square metres - has extensive medical facilities, enough space to hold 300 fullyequipped soldiers and a 'wet dock'. Mounts Bay would be an ideal platform to accommodate any rescued migrants without having to transport them to a shore base. The ship could be used as an offshore holding centre, perhaps before returning the migrants to Turkey. The ship has one Wildcat helicopter, designed for anti-submarine warfare but with the capacity to conduct surveillance missions over large areas of ocean. Mounts Bay, whose home port is Falmouth in Cornwall, also has a floating dock where ships carrying migrants could offload their passengers. Britain is sending two fast patrol boats, known as ""cutters"", operated by the UK Border Agency, to join VOS Grace, which is already in the region.

The UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, has said for the first time that the large-scale processing of migrants and refugees outside Europe, in countries such as Egypt, Libya or Sudan, may be necessary as frontline authorities claim they have been abandoned by Brussels in the face of a ""colossal humanitarian catastrophe"". Hundreds of thousands of people are preparing to make treacherous crossings on unseaworthy vessels from the north African coast to Greece and Italy as this summer's ""boat season"" gets under way, say officials. Figures for the first few months of this year already show a dramatic increase on previous years. UNHCR's European director, Vincent Cochetel, told the Guardian: ""We would not be totally against external processing if certain safeguards were in place: the right to appeal, fair process, the right to remain while appeals take place."" The EU had not found effective mechanisms to prevent migrants dying at sea, he said. Instead of focusing on ever tougher border controls, the EU needed to establish safe routes. Campaigners for refugee rights have hitherto rejected the idea of large processing camps outside Europe, fearing refugees would be at the mercy of states with poor records on human rights and justice. ""There's no way that could work,"" said Judith Sutherland of Human Rights Watch (HRW). ""In theory, HRW doesn't have a problem with creating channels of access to asylum in the EU from outside (but) you can't imagine (the right) conditions being met in Libya, or Egypt or Morocco."" Greece, which currently holds the EU presidency, is also pressing for the establishment of holding centres in north Africa and the Middle East to process refugees and migrants before they reach European soil. In addition, the Greek government is calling for an international seaborne taskforce to patrol the Mediterranean in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants. Greece will table the proposals at an EU summit next month, according to senior government officials in Athens. ""The shaping of a comprehensive immigration policy is one of the main priorities of (the Greek presidency), as well as the Italian presidency, which follows ours,"" Greece's deputy prime minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said. ""The Mediterranean countries of the EU are working together closely. But the Greek coastline is longer than the total coastline of the other member states. Without a substantial reassessment of (policies) . . . we cannot confront the crisis."" Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, Greece's merchant marine minister, said processing offices should be set up in Syria or Turkey ""to examine who is eligible, or not, before people get on boats, put their lives in danger and trespass our borders"". Italy has pledged to force the migrant issue to the top of the EU agenda when it takes over the presidency in July. ""Europe will not see an Italy banging its fist on the table, but an Italy that overturns the table,"" interior minister Angelino Alfano said last week. The latest figures show a rapidly accelerating problem. About 42,000 people have attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Italy so far this year, according to the EU border agency, Frontex. Last year there were 3,362 arrivals by the end of April, said UNHCR. Last week, more than 1,000 migrants stormed a razor-wire fence at Melilla, a Spanish enclave in Morocco, in order to reach European territory, and 400 breached the barrier. The same day, French riot police bulldozed three camps holding hundreds of refugees in Calais. The Greek merchant marine ministry said 15,000 undocumented migrants attempted to enter Europe via Greece last year, requiring a third of the 7,000-strong Greek coastguard to be redeployed to the eastern Aegean. The numbers have been swelled by large numbers of Syrian refugees seeking to escape the civil war, which has displaced millions of people in the past three years. Some 7,000 refugees from Syria arrived on the Italian coast in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 350 in the whole of 2012. They are the second largest group to arrive by sea in Italy this year, after Eritreans. Most of those making boat journeys to Greece are Syrians, including women and children. Since the Greek government erected a 10.5km barbed-wire fence along its border with Turkey, 90% of illegal migration has been channelled through the eastern Aegean, with coastguards engaged in a daily battle with human traffickers. ""It's clear that the fence has rerouted the flow to the Aegean,"" said Sutherland. Another fence, planned for the Turkish-Bulgarian border, is likely to have a similar impact. ""The sealing of that border will lead to even more sea crossings,"" she said. In recent weeks there have been dozens of deaths in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas between Turkey and Greece. The Italian Red Cross has called for a ""humanitarian corridor"" to be opened for people fleeing war and famine. In a statement condemning the EU's inaction, Amnesty International said: ""With virtually no safe and legal routes into Europe, people are increasingly pushed into the hands of smugglers and traffickers, and are forced to risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels."" At least a third of those heading for Greece end up having to be rescued. Many boats are in poor condition and are overcrowded. In addition, ""migrants travelling in small inflatables have explicit instructions from traffickers to sink boats once they see the coastguard so they can be picked up in EU waters,"" Varvitsiotis said. ""We can't deal with this problem forever alone. Europe needs to have an equal burden policy."" Sicily has borne the brunt of illegal migrants heading for Italy since the temporary closure of a reception centre on the island of Lampedusa, and local authorities say they feel abandoned by Brussels and Rome. They predict a continuing rise in arrivals over the summer. ""If strong action isn't taken, it will be a disaster,"" said Enzo Bianco, the centre-left mayor of Catania and former Italian interior minister. ""Either there is a strong initiative by the Italian government and by the EU, or we will be facing a real disaster of colossal proportions. If we're in a crisis with 50,000 arrivals, imagine what will happen if there are 500,000-600,000."" At a funeral in Catania last week for 17 migrants who died off the coast of Libya, Bianco condemned Europe's ""deafening silence"": ""Faced with a looming, colossal humanitarian catastrophe, with almost 800,000 people on the African coast ready to cross the Mediterranean . . . Faced with these coffins, Europe must choose (whether to) bury our consciences of civilised men along with them."" After 366 migrants died off the coast of Lampedusa last autumn, the European commission set up Eurosur, a surveillance operation aimed at reacting more quickly to boats in distress. This was strengthened by the Italian search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum, which has so far rescued 30,000 people from the sea at a cost of more than euros 9m (£7.3m) a month. Italy says the headquarters of Frontex, the European border authority, should move from Poland to Sicily to deal with the growing crisis. ""Europe is distracted. But Europe can't pretend it's nothing. The problem exists . . . We need resources,"" said Luigi Ammatunna, the mayor of Pozzallo on Sicily's south-eastern coast, which has received 8,500 migrants this year. The cash-strapped Greek government said it spent euros 65m to protect the eastern seafront last year, with only euros 2m contributed by the EU. Rising numbers of refugees have fuelled support for rightwing politicians in Greece and Italy. The neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, which has focused on the issue, pulled off a surprisingly strong performance in local and European elections in Greece. The leader of the xenophobic Northern League in Italy, Matteo Salvini, flew to Sicily last month to demand an end to Mare Nostrum. Alfano, the Italian interior minister, adopted increasingly provocative rhetoric with Brussels during the European election campaign, threatening to defy EU asylum rules and ""just let them (asylum seekers) go"" out of Italy to other countries. Last week, he warned Brussels to shoulder the euros 300,000-a-day cost of Mare Nostrum, or the Italian government would deduct it from its EU contributions. Italy, he said, could not ""become the prison of refugees who want to go to northern Europe"". Meanwhile, refugees in Sicily are being housed in makeshift accommodation, such as schools and sports halls, with inadequate reception and processing facilities. The arrival of large numbers of migrants, including many unaccompanied children, ""creates problems for us - not because we don't want them, but because we want to provide a reception worthy of the name"", said Ammatunna. ""Receiving these people, then treating them badly, not giving them a proper welcome, not being able to give the services that we would like to be able to give them - this we do not want."" 21>= Continued on page 2 >= continued from page 1 Captions: The closure of a centre on Lampedusa has driven more refugees to Sicily",Broadsheet,0,2014-06,1,Policy

""They will stay there while we help them find their own accommodation on the private rental market, usually about 28 days,"" Rafferty said. The centre, which coordinates most humanitarian arrivals in Perth, will also help enrol the children in school, set the family up with Centrelink and Medicare, and provide referrals for healthcare and trauma counselling.  Rafferty said there were fewer than 100 Syrians in Perth and the centre was trying to encourage community members to set up a formal association so new migrants could easily find them. ""That is one of the difficulties here with a new group of arrivals when there's not an established ethnic group here,"" he said.

Our borough is now home to nine families and we hope to welcome more people throughout the year.  Yana, 20, fled Syria in 2013 when her brother was imprisoned and her house destroyed. The youngest of six siblings who have been scattered around the globe by the conflict, Yana has settled in well in Islington. She recently passed her first accountancy exams and her English has blossomed as she has made friends, including in a Red Cross-run choir she recently joined. Stories such as these are a testament to the contribution they've made to our community and evidence of a smooth transition into our borough.   Related: I work with child refugees in Calais. Theresa May's deception is a cruel act | Benny Hunter Yet issues remain that have made the process of resettlement harder than it needs to be, particularly the Home Office's insistence that those who have arrived under the government's Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) be granted five-year humanitarian protection visas instead of typical refugee status, which affords people the ability to travel and access to student finance as well as to some social security support. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to the families we have welcomed. As grantees of humanitarian protection, those who have arrived under the Syrian VPRS scheme are not entitled to a UN travel document. Instead, they must either use their own passport or apply for a certificate of travel. At £218 per person, this is unaffordable for many of those who only recently escaped a horrific civil war that is still ongoing. The matter is compounded by the fact that many countries - including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Egypt - do not accept such a document or are very unlikely to. The Home Office has told us of a case in which at least one family obtained these documents only to be subsequently turned away as they attempted to travel. This seemingly insignificant administrative matter is the cause of great distress to families  Kaya Comer-Schwarz  As for their own passports, of the nine Islington families, only three have valid Syrian documentation; one family's passports expire shortly. Many have close family - children, parents and siblings - in Europe and around Syria. To make matters worse, help with family reunion is now outside the scope of legal aid, like so many other issues. The inability to travel to see relatives is proving to be seriously distressing to these families. In some cases, it is preventing us from effectively supporting them to integrate. Late last year we urged the Home Office to reconsider this disparity between the two definitions. We are not alone in doing so: recently the Commons Public Accounts Committee made similar calls in its report on the VPRS scheme, pointing out that granting humanitarian protection rather than refugee status risked people missing out on access to some public services It would greatly assist us in providing the best support to families, without incurring additional costs, if refugee status were granted through a fast-track process set up in consultation with experts on asylum law and policy.

The impact of Syria's refugee crisis on the Middle East has been immense. Turkey hosts more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, Lebanon is home to 1.1 million, and Jordan has registered nearly 620,000, the UNHCR said. Iraq hosts 232,800 Syrian refugees and Egypt close to 136,000. These five countries host 97% of Syria's refugees, according to Amnesty International. About 80,000 Syrians live in Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp, making it the country's fourth largest city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a credible source inside the country, estimates that 210,000 people have died in the conflict. About 6.5 million Syrians have been displaced within the country, according to the Migration Policy Centre. Syrian refugees now comprise 26% of Lebanon's total population, placing a strain on humanitarian resources. Political pressure to stem the flow of new arrivals led Lebanon to impose strict entry requirements on Syrians at the end of last year, raising concerns that more displaced people will remain in danger inside the country as fighting continues. Syrians fleeing the civil war are also streaming across European borders. European law requires people to be physically present in the country they are petitioning for asylum. This has sparked a boom in illegal migration across the Mediterranean. About 218,000 Syrian refugees had applied for asylum in EU countries as of December 2014, according to the UNHCR. Germany and Sweden fielded nearly half of all asylum requests. The UNHCR's data does not include internally displaced people or those who have not registered at a recognised refugee camp. Refugees are defined by the UNHCR as those with a legitimate fear of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, or affiliation with a social or political group, and who are outside their country of origin. Asylum seekers are people whose claims of persecution have not yet been substantiated.  According to the 1951 refugee convention, which was amended in 1967, ""refugees deserve, as a minimum, the same standards of treatment enjoyed by other foreign nationals in a given country and, in many cases, the same treatment as nationals"". The UK has fielded asylum applications from fewer than 6,000 Syrian refugees, but the British government has committed £800m in humanitarian aid to the Syrian crisis, its largest response to a humanitarian emergency.",Broadsheet,0,2015-03,0,Migration

The plans, which are set to be announced in March, will raise the temperature of the UK's EU referendum campaign, even if the British government chooses to opt out.  Although the UK is not a member of the EU's border-free travel Schengen zone, it can choose to opt into EU asylum policy, meaning any changes will play into the highly charged campaign on Britain's future in Europe.  The UK takes part in the so-called Dublin system, which means refugees must remain in the first country they arrive in.  A European commission spokeswoman said there were ""systemic deficiencies in the way the current Dublin system is working"", and added the UK would have to decide whether to take part in the new rules.   Related: Pressure to resolve migration crisis could tear EU apart ""The UK would then have to choose whether it would participate or not in a new system, but we don't know what this system would look like as we have not presented it,"" she said.  EU leaders are due in March to agree a sweeping overhaul of Europe's migration policy, which is struggling to cope with the 1.1 million refugees who arrived on the continent in 2015.  Officials in Brussels are increasingly concerned that talks on Britain's EU membership are distracting attention from the migration crisis. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, called on Wednesday for his counterpart at the European council, Donald Tusk, to set a date for a further summit in February to debate migration policy.  ""I'm rather worried that we won't have enough time to tackle the refugee question in sufficient depth so I would recommend to Mr Tusk a further summit,"" Juncker said. ""We can't have a success on the UK and not address the refugee crisis - that would be the wrong kind of signal."" This followed a warning from Tusk that the EU had just two months to save its border-free travel zone. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, who chairs EU leaders' meetings, said the EU must agree a new migration strategy at a summit in March. ""The March European council [meeting of EU leaders] will be the last moment to see if our strategy works,"" he told members of the European parliament on Tuesday. ""If it doesn't we will face grave consequences, such as the collapse of Schengen.""  Related: IMF says refugee influx could provide EU economic boost European governments have been putting up fences and re-establishing border controls across the continent, after more than 1 million refugees fleeing chaos and war in the Middle East and Africa landed on Europe's shores in 2015.  The vast majority of refugees have ended up in northern Europe, mainly Germany, Sweden and Austria, prompting these governments to push for mandatory quotas that would result in refugees and migrants being settled across the continent. But fewer than 300 refugees have been resettled under the plan, despite ambitions of finding 160,000 a new home.  The UK has remained outside the quota system because it is not in the Schengen zone, although it is signed up to the Dublin regulation, which obliges member states to take responsibility for refugees who arrive in their country first.  This system has been under strain for years, and was in effect finished off last August when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said all Syrian refugees would be eligible to seek shelter in Germany. Speaking on Wednesday, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said he wanted to ""kill this idea that a refugee himself or herself decided which country to go to ... it should be the European Union [that decides]"".  With thousands of refugees arriving in Greece every day at the peak of the crisis, the EU agreed last year to scrap a rule requiring refugees to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in. The EU is now moving to formalise the end of the Dublin system and is expected to publish a legal text in March. Referring to the plans, Tusk also criticised EU member states for ""a clear delivery deficit on many fronts"", citing failure to find the money for a (EURO)3bn (£2.3bn) action plan agreed with Turkey last year in an attempt to keep more refugees in the region.  The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has also voiced his frustration at the EU's failure to find the funds promised to Turkey to obtain Ankara's help to tackle the refugee crisis. ""I am disappointed and concerned that the (EURO)3bn that the EU agreed to provide Turkey to support their efforts in dealing with the influx of refugees has been held up,"" he said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday. ""The UK made an early commitment to pay its share and I'll continue to push other member states to resolve this as quickly as possible."" The EU's struggle to preserve its border-free travel zone forms the backdrop to its negotiations with the UK, as the British government seeks to rewrite the terms of its EU membership. Officials are increasingly confident they can reach a deal with the UK in February, which Tusk described as ""not easy but possible"". An agreement in February would pave the way for a referendum in June, avoiding holding an autumn vote during the peak time for refugee arrivals. Either way, EU migration and asylum policy is certain to loom large in the campaign.  The campaign to leave the EU has seized on reports that the UK may have to take more refugees in future.

Turkey has agreed to take back any asylum seekers who land in Greece, starting from Sunday. In theory this means the closure of the Aegean smuggling route, via which more than 850,000 people reach Greece from Turkey last year. What does Turkey get in return? The European Union has promised to give Ankara (EURO)6bn (£4.7bn) to help the estimated 2.7 million Syrians now stuck on Turkish soil. It will also become easier for Turks to get European visas, and the EU will pay greater lip-service to the idea of Turkey becoming a member state. For each Syrian returned to Turkey, Europe has promised to accept another Syrian living in a Turkish camp - though if the Aegean flow stops, this mechanism is not likely to see much use. Will this end all migration to Europe?  Related: EU strikes deal with Turkey to send back refugees It will almost certainly cut numbers, but historical migration patterns consistently show that when one route closes, another one opens. Other potential routes lie between Turkey and Bulgaria, Turkey and Italy, Libya and Italy, Morocco and Spain, and Russia and Finland. Is the deal legal? It depends on who you ask. Rights groups say it breaks both EU law and the UN refugee convention, a hallowed text created in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The convention says signatories cannot expel asylum seekers without examining their claims individually. In response, the EU claims people will be examined individually - but since it will suddenly and simultaneously deem Turkey a safe country for refugees, most people will still be sent back en masse.  Related: Syrian refugees still aim for Europe as leaders finalise EU-Turkey deal Is Turkey safe for refugees? The EU suddenly deems it safe, but it has not previously done so - and with good reason. Turkey is not fully signed up to the UN refugee convention; has broken international law by sending back refugees to Syria; and, despite new labour legislation, does not in practice offer most Syrians genuine access to legal work. As a result, many Syrians send their children to work to make ends meet. Non-Syrian refugees have even fewer rights. In logistical terms, can the deal work? It will be a struggle. Greece currently lacks the capacity to process so many asylum claims. Previously it only had to move refugees towards Macedonia; now it has to address their cases directly, and potentially house them for days or weeks while logistics with Turkey are thrashed out. To do this, Greece says it needs Europe to send it 2,500 more asylum officials - a tough ask, given that the EU has failed to send it far smaller numbers in the past. What about the refugees currently stuck in Greece? Since the closure of the Macedonian border, more than 40,000 refugees have been trapped in squalid conditions in Greece. These will not be returned to Turkey under the terms of the deal - but in theory will be shared between the members of the EU. In practice, EU members have failed to uphold earlier articulations of this sharing process in the past, and may yet do so again, leading to a humanitarian crisis in Greece. Some of those trapped may try to move onwards through the Balkans - via Albania, perhaps, and conceivably by sea to Italy.",Broadsheet,0,2016-03,0,Policy

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has said the decision will mean that other groups such as Iraqi, Palestinian and Kurdish minorities who sought refuge in Syria before the conflict but have had to flee again can now be helped. It will also mean that mixed nationality family groups will also become eligible. Rudd said the decision follows advice from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that a diversified resettlement quota is needed in order to address the needs of the most vulnerable refugees in the region. Up until March 7,307 Syrian refugees, identified by the UNHCR, had been brought to Britain under the resettlement scheme. Half of them have been children. The decision to extend the scope of the scheme will not however lead to any increase in the 20,000 limit. Rudd said: ""It is vitally important that we focus our support on the most vulnerable refugees in the region who have fled the atrocities in Syria, whatever their nationality. I am proud that the UK is continuing to be proactive and by expanding the scheme we are making sure our doors continue to remain open to the people who most need our help."" She said that 235 local authorities across the UK had stepped up to provide places under the government's refugee resettlement programmes. The Syrian vulnerable persons resettlement scheme was expanded by David Cameron in September 2015 to take 20,000 from the refugee camps bordering Syria in response to the Mediterranean refugee crisis. It followed a decision by Britain to withdrew its financial support for proactive search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean for refugees and migrants at risk of their lives in open boats. The refugee resettlement scheme in Britain is open to the most vulnerable refugees who have fled the Syrian conflict and cannot return to their country of origin whatever their nationality. The home secretary said the decision also demonstrated that Britain intended to play its part in tackling the global migration crisis by taking refugees from the region - from Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt - as well as providing humanitarian assistance in response to the Mediterranean migration crisis. ""Our approach is rightly based on targeting our support so that it delivers the most impact, helps those who need it the most and avoids unintended consequences,"" she added. In the Commons, Rudd was challenged by the Liberal Democrat MP, Tom Brake, over why only 200 ""Dubs children"" - a reference Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who successfully secured the original commitment to take refugee children - had so far arrived when the government had promised to take 480 lone child refugees who had made it to Europe. The home secretary told him that efforts were under way with Italy and Greece to identify children who might benefit from the remaining places: ""I am aware of these numbers. We have made it clear that we are ready and stand able to take those additional children.  ""Some of those children have already settled where they are but we remain engaged with those countries to see if we can help those children who have not settled and whose best interests would be settled by coming here.""",Broadsheet,0,2017-07,1,Policy

The money is due to be allocated to help countries in the region surrounding Syria, primarily Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, with a focus on Syrian children's education and improving the chances of refugees finding paid work.   The conference in February accepted that many refugees were likely to be living outside Syria on a long-term basis and may never be able to return to their country torn apart by a five-year civil war. In total $12.1bn (£8.3bn) was pledged at the Supporting Syria and the Region conference, organised by the British prime minister, David Cameron. It was said to be the largest amount ever raised for a humanitarian crisis in a single day. The report written by Concern Worldwide shows $6bn was promised for 2016 at the conference, but that by mid April only $1.16 billion had been committed.  The report shows 94% of the London conference donors had not turned their pledges into actual commitments, and 18 of the donors that made pledges had committed none of their funds, including Kuwait (one of the co-hosts). It also suggests that 98% of Saudi Arabia's pledge, 96% of the UK's pledge, over 89% of Germany's and the EC's pledges were all still outstanding. Only three donors (Australia, Malta, Lithuania) had fully committed their funding pledges. The report also found that by the end of April, 52% of pledged funds had yet to be allocated to an implementing organisation, 47% had not been allocated to a particular appeal, and 28% had not been allocated to a recipient country affected by the crisis.  The speed of the pledges matter since it is hard for aid agencies to make plans without long-term allocated commitments. Simon Starling, head of advocacy at Concern Worldwide (UK) and the report's author, said:""Pledges are just words until they are translated into commitments; donors have simply not acted fast enough. The statistics indicate there is a critical time-lapse between donors voicing their pledges and turning them into a financial reality. It is Syrians that pay the price of this delay.""  The report also claims that too many of the pledges are skewed towards neighbouring countries, when there are huge humanitarian needs inside the country. The report shows the London conference donors have so far allocated three times the amount of money to the regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) than to the Syria Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).  Starling said: ""The humanitarian response in neighbouring countries continues to garner more funds than the response inside Syria, which is where the majority of people in need remain. This balance must be redressed, and donor governments must push all parties to the conflict to grant unconditional humanitarian access to reach those most in need."" The report's authors said: ""Monitoring of commitments made at the London conference to date has been inadequate and opaque. Formal, public frameworks must be established to hold donors and governments to account for their commitments. ""The co-hosts of the London conference must work with refugee-hosting countries to track policy as well as financial commitments. Donors should work with the United Nations to develop suitable accountability structures that can capture both humanitarian and developing funding for protracted crises. This effort should include an agreed maximum timeframe to turn financial pledges into a reality.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,0,Aid

Sixteen refugees, including three children, have been killed trying to escape the battlegrounds of northern Syria in the past four months, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a frequently cited watchdog.  It is shocking to think of people fleeing the combined atrocities of Islamic State and Bashar al-Assad being gunned down just as they make their bid for safety. But what is perhaps most shocking of all is that we observers are still shocked by this.  The shooting of Syrians on the border is not a new phenomenon. Refugees and rights groups have reported shootings of migrants on the Turkish-Syrian border since at least 2013. These abuses are well-documented, and the reports widely circulated. So why, in the months following a shady European deal that forces Turkey to shoulder the biggest burden of the refugee crisis, are we still so appalled when Turkey continues to use deadly violence to stop that burden getting any bigger?  Related: The Guardian view on the EU-Turkey deal: the victims will be its judges | Editorial A surge in border abuses is the logical result of a recent deal that sees the world's richest continent (population 500 million) corral a single Middle Eastern country (population 80 million) into caring for more Syrian refugees than the rest of the world combined. We shouldn't have expected any other outcome. But sadly, some did. And Europe's leaders - including David Cameron - apparently still do. Turkey is in the process of being designated by the EU as a ""safe third country"" for refugees - a sobriquet that gives Greece the right to send back almost all of those who land on its shores from Turkey. Leaders, including Cameron, have justified this with the claim that refugees are safe from mortal danger in Turkey. Border shootings show this is not always strictly true, as do well-substantiated allegations that Turkey has illegally returned some Syrians and Afghans to the danger of their home countries, even after they had safely settled on Turkish soil. An alarming new report by Amnesty International, released today, alleges that in recent weeks large groups of Syrians have been deported back to Syria from southern Turkey, as officials there attempt to reduce their refugee burden.  Related: Refugee crisis: What does the EU's deal with Turkey mean? In Cameron's favour, most refugees in Turkey are not at risk of death on a battlefield. But this is not what refugee advocates mean when they say that Turkey is an unsuitable place for refugees. Refugee rights extend far beyond the simple right to life: they include the right to education, to healthcare and to work. The point of giving people refugee status is to guarantee them all the opportunities that are extended to natural-born citizens of the country in which they now live. For all its generosity in welcoming more refugees than any other country, Turkey does not offer such a guarantee. Take the right to work. EU politicians justified their deportation deal with the claim that a new Turkish law, introduced in January, has now given Syrians access to legal employment.  That isn't actually the case. To qualify for a work permit, two things need to happen. First, a Syrian needs to have held a certain kind of ID card, known as a kimlik, for six months - and not everyone can get one. Second, an applicant's employer must give the Syrian a contract. Very few employers would ever want to do this, since the reason most Syrians find work on the black marker in the first place is precisely because they are illegal: they can be paid far less than the minimum wage, and work far longer than the legal daily limit. Many employers would rather fire a Syrian than pay him properly.  The first deportations of Syrians back to Turkey are set to begin on Monday. With little access to employment, the threat of deportation to Syria looming large and shootings on the border, we should be under no illusions that the deportees are being sent to safety.

A last-ditch effort to keep the 58-year-old man, known as Saeed, in Australia failed on Sunday night.  Saeed, a member of a persecuted minority, fled Iraq with his brother and arrived in Australia 2012. The brother was granted asylum but Saeed was not, prompting a series of protests.  Saeed's lawyer, Alison Battisson from Human Rights for All, was given no notice before his deportation on Sunday night. Battisson said Saeed is weak, weighing less than 50kg, has no money and is illiterate. He is not from a major city and will have little support upon arrival in Iraq.  Related: Iraqi and Syrian refugees will be settled in Armidale from next year Battisson said his prospects were bleak.  ""[They are] very, very low. He's not sophisticated, he's from a minority group, he's poor. He's always been very poor,"" she told Guardian Australia.  ""If he's alive in a couple of years, I'd be very surprised."" Saeed had been in detention for four years. A number of arrests were made when activists disrupted an attempt to deport him from Melbourne in March.  Saeed was instead taken to Villawood in Sydney, and went on hunger strike. He has been on hunger strike periodically since the move.  ""It's his health which is the main concern, and the treatment that he needs, I just can't imagine will be easily accessible in Iraq,"" Battisson said. ""He's not from the capital, he's not from a major city.""  Battison said she had been preparing one final appeal, directly to the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, to grant Saeed a visa on compassionate grounds. The late-night deportation rendered that appeal useless, she said. She said immigration authorities appeared to have arranged Saeed's deportation to avoid similar scenes to those in March.  A protester, upon learning of the deportation on Sunday, bought a plane ticket so he could get through immigration and hand leaflets to other passengers on Saeed's flight, she said.  The protester was not able to buy a ticket on Saeed's flight, she said, but encouraged other passengers to delay the trip.  Saeed's application for asylum was rejected on administrative grounds, according to Battisson, who blamed poor legal representation. She said a recent administrative appeals tribunal judgment had found another man, from the same minority and region as Saeed, had been granted asylum over fears of persecution.  ""The process has failed him,"" she said. ",Broadsheet,0,2017-08,0,Conditions

For the past few years, the Columbus Blue Jackets forward has watched as his relatives left war-torn Syria to make a safer life for themselves in the United States.   ""It's definitely an eye-opener with them coming over and getting adjusted to the lifestyle and the new language and things like that,"" he tells the Guardian. ""It definitely puts things in perspective for you.""   Saad traces his Syrian roots through his father, George, who was born in Syria and came to the United States at 18. He speaks glowingly of the way his father's hard work has served as an inspiration. George received two degrees from Columbia and the University of Pittsburgh, became a US citizen, and settled in Pittsburgh, where Saad was born. But many of George's brothers and sisters were left behind in Syria, which descended into a civil war in 2011.   Related: Syria's civil war: five years of Guardian reporting The US branch of the Saads feared for the safety of their relatives back in Syria as the country descended into one of the largest humanitarian crisis in recent memory, and they started the process of moving as many family members as possible to the United States.  ""Most of them are over here now and the ones that aren't here yet they're safe back home,"" says Saad. ""So really no issues there, everything's been good with that so that's always good to hear.""  Saad's uncles and aunts now live in Pittsburgh near his family, which has made the transition easier. Saad says his father has been help them settle in, relying on his experiences from the time he was a newly arrived immigrant. Saad - with the money that comes with an NHL career - has been able to help out on the financial side by sponsoring some of his relatives. Saad, whose maternal grandfather was an NFL official, grew up playing hockey and football before he made a career on the ice. After two Stanley Cups in four years with the Chicago Blackhawks, he was traded to the Blue Jackets, who rewarded him with a six-year contract worth $36m.   ""You try to help out as much as you can. My dad has worked hard to be successful so he can help them as well. But any way I can help I'm always here for them,"" Saad says. ""They know that. I've gotten pretty close with them over the short period of time.""  His Syrian family's arrival has also been an opportunity for Saad to expose them to hockey, a sport they didn't know much about. It's been a bonding experience, as Saad had not met any of his relatives in person, and only got to know them over Skype.  ""They've become huge fans of the sport and love watching me play,"" he says. ""It's pretty funny to interact and kind of see them see things for the first time. They've definitely all taken an interest in it because of me.""  Following the Paris terrorist attacks last November, the Syrian refugee crisis became a political football as figures such as Donald Trump urged a halt to the immigration process. However, it's not a debate Saad is willing to wade into. ""You hear about it,"" he says. ""For the most part, it is what it is and I just focus on playing hockey and hopefully the family's safely here through my dad. That's pretty much all you care about and all you can control.  Saad has only taken one trip to Syria, when he was a young child but he hopes that some day, when there is peace, he can make the journey as an adult. ""It's a beautiful country and I'd love to go back and see where my dad is from,"" Saad says. ""So I think that would be a great trip."" ",Broadsheet,0,2016-05,1,Migration

The so-called Donald Trumps of the continent. Austria's leader Norbert Hofer pledged to ""stop the invasion of Muslims"" by building a fence on his nation's southern border. Antisemitism and Islamophobia are rampant - recent polling in Hungary found at least one third of the population disliked Jews - and attacks against migrants in Germany echo a dark past. Making matters worse, the European Union is working with some of the most despotic African regimes to stop people leaving in the first place. It's why recent comments by Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton, questioning the language, suitability and adaptability of new arrivals, were so tame compared to the reckless and inflammatory outbursts by countless international counterparts. But Dutton's comments aren't the main issue here - it's what successive Australian governments have imposed on refugees over the last two decades and a general public who are willing to support it.  Related: Fact check: was Peter Dutton right about 'illiterate' refugees 'taking jobs'? This is not to defend Dutton's statements but they were hardly extreme or even unusual when compared to current global trends. Outrage over Dutton obscures the fact that Australia is now an inspiration globally over its refugee policies. Dismissing Dutton won't change this grim reality. That's the scandal that bedevils 21st Australia: cruelty against asylum seekers dressed up as compassion and deterrence.  Dutton was savaged for his comments and I don't have any sympathy for his stance but it's worth asking why anybody takes seriously Labor party posturing over his rhetoric. After all, it was on their watch that the most extreme form of offshore processing of asylum seekers, on Nauru and Manus Island, was re-introduced.  Labor's immigration spokesman Richard Marles recently said that there was an ""absolute guarantee"" his party now marched in unison with Liberal party policy over refugees. This means indefinite detention on remote Pacific islands and trying to strike deals with autocratic regimes in the region to take desperate people languishing for years without hope. Australia is a lucky nation if Dutton and his dog-whistling is the worst speech it needs to endure. A recent Amnesty survey found Australia was one of the most welcoming nations in the world towards refugees once they were living in the community and yet this is incongruous with a lack of public outcry towards abuses by private operators against asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island.  If murder and rape doesn't generate genuine outrage, then sympathy is clearly in short supply. Words matter but actions are far more damaging to both Australia's reputation and moral core. Australia remains deeply unsure of its identity, still unhealthily tied to Britain and the US, while being a geographical, if not ideological, part of Asia. Australia has spent more than two decades finding new and ingenious ways to isolate, punish and attack boat arrivals and Dutton is simply the latest in a long list of advocates for the cause. Recall Phillip Ruddock as immigration minister in the late 1990s unleashing draconian conditions for asylum seekers. Today he's cute clickbait for Buzzfeed. Buildings walls and fences, both literally and rhetorically, is the curse of this age and Australia has been leading the way for years. Chastising Dutton is necessary but it will have little effect on ingrained Australian attitudes towards people arriving by boat who look, sound and think differently (most of whom are Muslims).  An Australian media with few non-white faces doesn't help. To bring change will require a thorough examination of why Australia, as a relatively young, post-colonial nation, has never had proper accounting of its dark past and an honest assessment of how it treats the most vulnerable in its society and the world. Dutton needs to lift his game if he wants to compete with the master of the genre, Donald Trump (now back-tracking on his earlier call to ban all Muslims entering the US despite it having huge public support ). Trump is surging across America, and is a real possibility to win the general election in November, because white populations are feeling angry and disillusioned.   Related: We have an old saying in the dog-whistle business... | First Dog on the Moon Much of the mainstream media has given Trump huge amounts of free publicity and airtime. CBS head Les Moonves says the Republican candidate is "" damn good "" for business. The corporate press is a cosy club who know Trump well and have indulged his attitudes for decades. When Trump, his fellow Republicans and media attack dogs damn Syrian refugees and Islam the result is surging Islamophobia. Living away from Australia has given me a different take on Dutton and the surrounding furore. I've been writing, investigating and campaigning on asylum seekers for over a decade and Dutton's comments were just business as usual for a country that long ago lost any moral high-ground on refugees.  After an outburst such as Dutton's, I regularly hear asylum seeker supporters say that Australia is ""better than this"". How so? There are few times in Australia's history when Canberra wasn't targeting one minority or the other. Although Australia is a remarkably successful multicultural nation (in some of the main cities, at least), it'll never sleep and dream easily until it finds its own independent path.

On Sunday, Dutton told ABC's Insiders program the government could increase the intake further. ""I think if we can demonstrate that we can get the security and health checks right and that we're bringing the right people, that I think people will have confidence in the program - perhaps at some point - extending depending on the circumstances in Syria,"" Dutton said. ""The government is open to further assistance, given that this situation will deteriorate but we need to first demonstrate that we can bring the 12,000 across."" States and territories were in a ""bidding war"" to resettle the refugees, Dutton said, adding refugees would be resettled in areas where they had existing connections, such as family and friends. Greens MP Adam Bandt said the indication of an intake of Syrian refugees was a ""welcome shift"" in rhetoric from the government, but urged Dutton to consider resettling Syrians and Iraqis currently languishing in Australian-run offshore detention centres. ""If Peter Dutton is serious about caring for people in trouble, then he should start at home, and say, let's let the people, who are currently in Australian detention, who fled Syria, out living in the community as well,"" he told reporters on Sunday.

Dutton rejected suggestions the $1bn Australia spends keeping asylum seekers in offshore detention be better spent, insisting the detainees in Manus and Nauru were in better circumstances than those in the Zaatari camp. ""In the camp that I went into, there's raw sewage flowing down the streets, there's no electricity, people have open fire arrangements out in the camps,"" he said. ""We have an $11m hospital at the regional processing centre in Nauru, we've provided an additional $26m for the upgrade of the hospital on Nauru, we fly people down to either Australia or to Port Moresby for treatment at international hospitals.

Dutton reiterated his view refugee advocates such as Amnesty International had an ideological opposition to offshore detention. He refused to deny claims in a recent Amnesty report that people smugglers were paid to turn boats around, arguing Australian officials acted within the law.  Dutton was asked repeatedly to rule out the payments by Insiders host, Barrie Cassidy, but would not. ""Are you saying point-blank they did not pay people smugglers?"" Cassidy asked.  ""No such evidence was provided in the report of any illegal action,"" Dutton said. ""I will use my own words instead of having them framed. I'm putting to you that the government operates within the law, we've done that consistently in relation to Operation Sovereign Borders.""

His Commons promise to take 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years is at the bottom end of expectations. It stands in sharp contrast to the French pledge of 24,000 places over the next two years. As the Labour MP and father of the house, Gerald Kaufman, angrily pointed out: ""The Germans took in 10,000 refugees in one day."" Cameron has deliberately spurned taking part in a much bigger EU scheme to resettle those in the camps in countries neighbouring Syria. He has also rejected playing any part in the expected EU request this week to relocate the estimated 160,000 refugees who have made it across the Mediterranean to Italy and Greece or through the Balkans to Hungary. With more than 4 million Syrians already living in UN camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey it is hard to see how Britain's own-brand resettlement scheme can make any significant difference to the situation. It will undoubtedly make a world of difference to the few thousand who are lucky enough to be named each year by a British official as among the most deserving of sanctuary in the UK. But all the signs are that Cameron is set to repeat the same mistakes made when the UK's vulnerable persons relocation scheme, as it is officially known, was set up in January last year. One major reason why only 216 people actually arrived in Britain by the end of June this year under the scheme was the difficulty of finding councils willing to host them. This was not due to any lack of political will. Big cities such as Manchester, Sheffield and Glasgow were only too willing to help. But the Home Office was only willing to guarantee funding for the refugees for one year while they have been given resettlement rights in Britain for five years. Cameron made clear in the small print of his statement that this funding situation has yet to improve. Yes, the money is to come from the international aid budget, but its rules only allow the government to fund the reception of refugees in the UK and that means it cannot last more than 12 months. As the Local Government Association was quick to warn after Cameron's statement, councils must not be left to pick up the pieces again ""when the funding runs out and the world's attention has moved on"". The home secretary and the communities secretary have been given a week to thrash out a solution in the midst of the toughest public spending squeeze for a generation.  Related: Refugee crisis: what can you do to help? But the existing scheme not only suffers from funding problems - it is also one of the most bureaucratic refugee resettlement schemes in the world. While the EU's resettlement programme relies on a nomination from the UN high commissioner for refugees, Britain's operates complex criteria which Cameron has indicated are about to become even more complicated. The existing scheme is designed to give priority to those who are victims of sexual violence or torture or are too elderly or disabled to live in the camps. Cameron made clear that he wants to expand those priorities to include orphaned children, Christians and Yazidis. No doubt it will be a few more days before the official review of these criteria is completed, further delaying the arrival of anybody under the scheme. In his Commons statement, Cameron made much of how Britain did not need to take part in the EU's programmes to provide international protection, saying they could only operate within the Schengen border-free zone. But as Ireland, which also has an exemption from EU asylum programmes, has shown by volunteering to take 1,800 Syrian refugees over the next two years, it is perfectly possible to take part in that coordinated European response if Cameron wanted to. The UNHCR has called for an end to Europe's fragmented response to the refugee crisis. France and Germany seem to recognise that a joint European approach is the only way to match the scale of that crisis. In a key test of European solidarity, when Germany is saying it cannot be expected to act alone, Britain has decided once again to sit it out on the sidelines. As the French president, Francois Hollande, put it on Monday : ""It's true that Britain is not in the Schengen area ... but that doesn't absolve it from making an effort in terms of solidarity,"" making clear there would be a price to be paid when Britain in turn demands 'solidarity' over reform of the EU.",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,0,Policy

The deteriorating conditions in Lebanon and Jordan, particularly the lack of food and healthcare, have become intolerable for many of the 4 million people who have fled Syria, driving fresh waves of refugees north-west towards Europe and aggravating the current crisis. Speaking to the Guardian, the UN high commissioner for refugees, António Guterres, said: ""If you look at those displaced by conflict per day, in 2010 it was 11,000; last year there were 42,000. This means a dramatic increase in need, from shelter to water and sanitation, food, medical assistance, education. ""The budgets cannot be compared with the growth in need. Our income in 2015 will be around 10% less than in 2014. The global humanitarian community is not broken - as a whole they are more effective than ever before. But we are financially broke.""  Recent months have seen severe cuts to food rations for Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan as well as for Somali and Sudanese refugees in Kenya. Darfuris living in camps in Chad have been warned that their rations may end completely at the end of the year. UN-run healthcare services have also been closed across a large part of Iraq, leaving millions of internally displaced people without access to healthcare.  Guterres warned that the damage being done by these cuts would be impossible to reverse. ""We know that we are not doing enough, we are failing the basic needs of people. ""The situation is beyond irreparable. If you look at the number of children who will see their lives so dramatically impacted by malnutrition and lack of psychosocial support, you will see this is already happening.""  The majority of the UN's humanitarian work is funded entirely by voluntary donations from individual governments and private donors, with agencies such as the UNHCR and Unicef receiving none of the regular budget that member states pay into the UN's central coffers. Guterres is leading calls from within the UN to change this system and ask member states to make more regular payments to the main agencies.  The current global humanitarian funding budget for all countries stands at $19.52bn (£12.84bn), but only $7.15bn of that has been raised from international donors.  The Syria regional refugee response plan is only funded to 35% of the $1.3bn needed to support refugees, both in the camps and by providing resilience funding for the countries hosting them. In Africa, where the crises in the Central African Republic and South Sudan do not often make international headlines, many funding appeals are less than 15% full.  Experts say the current system, with constant emergency appeals to keep supply chains running month by month, must be changed to acknowledge that the situations in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Central African Republic are all deteriorating and need long-term funding.  In August, a multi-million dollar shortfall forced the World Health Organisation to close down 184 health clinics across 10 of Iraq's 18 districts, in an area that has seen severe fighting and massive internal displacement. The cuts have left three million people without access to healthcare. The World Health Organisation is trying to raise $60m to fund healthcare in Iraq but so far only $5.1m has been given by donors.  Dr Michelle Gayer is director for emergency risk management at the WHO. She told the Guardian that the gap between the desperate need in countries such as Iraq and current funding levels risked permanent damage to public health across whole populations.   ""The global community, including WHO, we are dealing with emergencies of really unprecedented scale and nature,"" she said. ""This has a disproportionate impact on health because health deteriorates in a conflict situation over time. ""People haven't been vaccinated, they suffer from malnutrition, they have mental health issues because of the conflict. We are setting countries back decades.""  Gayer said the decision to cut services was hugely difficult. ""We are never 100% funded so we are always having to prioritise, but it breaks your heart when you end services for 3 million people. There will be no access for trauma like shrapnel wounds, no access for children's health or reproductive health. There will be no surveillance of things like cholera. A generation of children will be unvaccinated.""  She supports the idea that there should be a change to the current funding system for UN agencies. ""Most people who work outside the humanitarian sector, they would fall over backwards if they knew how we do our work, having to ask each and every year for funding.""  Another major crisis for the UN is feeding refugees, not only those recently displaced but people who are still unable to return home years after leaving.  This year the World Food Programme cut rations to 1.6 million Syrian refugees. The most vulnerable living in Lebanon now only have $13 to spend on food each month, a figure that the WFP warned would leave refugees vulnerable to recruitment by extremist groups.  And this pattern has been repeated around the world. Since the beginning of the year, the WFP has twice cut food rations for refugees in the Daadab and Kakuma camps in northern Kenya, as well as for Sudanese refugees in Uganda. Dina El-Kassaby, a spokeswoman for the WFP based in Cairo, said the cut in rations was pushing refugees into making dangerous decisions, including returning to Syria or travelling irregularly to Europe.  ""This is a desperate situation for families. In the last few weeks in Jordan and Lebanon many refugees were asking me how they can get on one of these boats to Europe and we have run into many people who have said they will consider returning to Syria if food rations don't return to previous levels.""  ""As the year goes by and the funding crisis gets deeper we are making more and more cuts. Mothers are telling us that they are being evicted from their houses and are now living in makeshift shelters in the field because their rent money is going on food. Think about young men and boys who are responsible for feeding their families. Reaching these desperate levels makes them prime targets for Isis.""  One Syrian refugee, Fatmeh, said of her two children in Lebanon: ""When we can't afford both medicine and food, I tie scarves around my boys' bellies at night so they don't wake up crying from stomach aches because they are hungry."" Kassaby said the current funding system meant the WFP never had the funds it needed. ""This is a hand-to-mouth operation: the minute money comes in it goes out. We have been operating with a funding deficit since the beginning of the year and right now we are short of $149m to help Syrians just through September and October.""  The UNHCR also says it is seeing evidence that refugees are making the dangerous journey into Europe because conditions in the Middle East are worsening.  On the Greek islands, where UNHCR frontline workers meet refugees as they arrive by boat, they cite new arrivals saying they were pushed into leaving Lebanon, Jordan or Turkey by a shortage of food or a desperate need for medical treatment.  Carlotta Sami, the UNHCR spokeswoman for southern Europe, said: ""They mention ration cuts or difficulty in getting electricity. We meet many people who are chronically sick or have sick children and say they can't go on living in this way. One Syrian man had a bullet lodged in his stomach and had travelled from Turkey hoping he could have surgery in Germany. He was suffering so much.""  Guterres wants to see rapid changes to the funding system. ""It's a very dramatic situation and it's clear that because Syrians can't work legally and the assistance is not enough, then that is one of the reasons why more people are moving onwards.""  ""As [UN] peacekeeping operations are funded by assessed contributions I think that at least major emergencies like Syria should benefit from assessed contributions that all member states contribute to.  ""If you look at the humanitarian budget all over the world, it is somewhere between $20bn and $30bn. I don't know any bailout of even a medium-sized bank that did not cost more than that. Not to spend more on humanitarian aid is a bad strategy, not to say a suicidal one."" ",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,0,Conditions

In 2012, Safa and her husband, both in their late 20s, were living in Aleppo when a blast destroyed their home, injuring him and leaving them with nothing. The young couple travelled by bus to Lebanon where, for six months, they shared a room and one toilet with 10 other people. Surviving on a tiny stipend from the UN, they were eventually given their own room - ""about the size of this"", she says, gesturing to a small table - in return for collecting all the rubbish in the block. It was there that she gave birth to her first child, a daughter, now 18 months old. ""We were treated like animals,"" she says.

Navigating the British health service without the language or confidence to ask the right questions, their interaction with maternity services can be too little or come too late, with complications going undetected. Asylum-seeking and refugee women are statistically more likely to experience late miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. In the UK, Safa faced the prospect of giving birth without anyone she knew in the room. ""My husband will be looking after her,"" she explains, whispering Arabic into her daughter's ear. ""And we are alone here - we had to leave all our friends and family in Aleppo."" I was scared. Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies Thanks to a newly revived befriender scheme run by the Refugee Council, Safa will not be alone. Last week, she was introduced to Fatoma, a bustling, maternal woman in a denim maxi dress and peach headscarf who scoops Safa's daughter up and tickles her. Fatoma fled the civil war in Sudan 10 years ago, arriving in Leeds; she has volunteered to support Safa through her pregnancy and the early stages of motherhood. She grins at her new friend: ""I met her for the first time on Tuesday, and she has already asked me to be at the hospital during her labour."" Fatoma understands what it is like to be alone in a country you do not understand, and which often does not understand you. When she gave birth to her daughter six years ago, it was ""terrifying, confusing and lonely"", she says, wiping away a tear. I meet Safa and Fatoma in a municipal office space in Leeds. They are among a small group of mothers (Sudanese, Syrian, Russian, Bolivian) who sit and trade stories, passing their babies between them. Each experienced a terrifying flight from her home country. Now, through the Refugee Council, each of them has volunteered to support another pregnant woman. ""These are some of the most marginalised women in our country,"" says Rose McCarthy, volunteer coordinator for the scheme, which started in 2011 and is currently relaunching with a focus on Syrian women. ""But they believe no one should have to give birth in this country afraid and alone."" With Fatoma translating her Arabic, Safa explains: ""I don't yet speak English, so when I have the baby I want someone with me I can trust and speak to in my own language."" She looks shyly at Fatoma. ""I feel so much better already, knowing that she will be there."" *** When Luisa arrived in this country from Bolivia in 2009, she spoke barely a word of English. Knowing no one, she spent two years determinedly learning the language by watching TV. When she became pregnant a few months later, it was a shock. ""She was my first baby, so I didn't know very much about being pregnant, or about labour,"" she says. ""I didn't even have a GP. And I didn't know about midwives - they don't exist where I come from."" When she gave birth, ""It was horrible - I felt like I was being torn apart."" At home in Chuquisaca, she was a law student. She was organising demonstrations against the government when, in 2008, there were violent clashes between supporters and opponents of President Evo Morales. Her friends began to disappear and her mother, fearing her daughter would be next, sent her to the UK. After her baby, also called Luisa, was born, the two were briefly sent to a detention centre, before being moved from London to Leeds. ""I became paranoid,"" Luisa says. ""I had an appointment at the Home Office, but no money to get there. I went to the Refugee Council offices to ask for emergency funds, but I'd already received some and they said no. I was desperate. I had no money to feed my daughter, so I left her there in the offices, making sure she was safe. Then I walked out and tried to kill myself."" She took an overdose of sleeping pills. Meanwhile, staff at the Refugee Council had found her telephone number, called her and kept her talking until an ambulance arrived. When she was discharged from hospital, Luisa was referred to the befriender scheme as a new mother in need. At the charity's offices, Luisa had her first meeting with her volunteer befriender, Dasha. ""I didn't want to know at first,"" Luisa admits. ""For a long time, I'd only really interacted with people who sat behind desks, asking lots of questions I didn't feel comfortable answering. I felt everyone was pitying me, and I can't stand pity. But Dasha was really funny, and really persistent. If I cancelled a plan to meet up, she might turn up on my doorstep. She worked in a cafe and would bring cake. For the first time since I arrived in this country, she talked to me as an equal, not an inferior."" Befrienders make the most enormous difference. They are figures of trust for women who may be scared to trust others Dasha, whose family claimed asylum in the UK from Russia 15 years ago, took Luisa to playgroups. Together, the women joined self-esteem classes provided by students from Leeds University in collaboration with the Refugee Council. ""She even bought me a Christmas present,"" Luisa says with a smile. One day, Dasha dropped by Luisa's flat and found her young daughter falling in and out of consciousness. ""Luisa didn't know what to do,"" Dasha remembers. ""There was deep snow outside but I told her we had to get to the hospital."" She bundled the three of them into a taxi and they rushed to A&E. ""The doctors were talking about terrifying possibilities, and making Luisa sign all sorts of forms,"" Dasha tells me. ""Everything turned out fine, but sometimes you just need a friend, someone who knows how the system works, someone who can explain and hold your hand, who can pack an overnight bag and bring snacks for you."" *** There are many reasons why migrant women might fail to engage with health services. Like Luisa, their isolation might mean they simply do not know about them. Others fear being charged for services they cannot afford: undocumented women can be charged up to £9,000 for giving birth in this country; last month's government proposal that patients could be required to bring two forms of identification to hospital to alleviate so-called ""health tourism"", has fuelled further fears. Pregnant refugees often need urgent care. They are likely to have arrived in this country malnourished, with conditions ranging from tuberculosis and malaria to HIV. Plus, as Dasha says, ""They come here to escape from danger - how could they not be psychologically damaged, too?"" Yet those who do access help often report poor experiences: no interpreters, or midwives and other maternity workers who do not understand their cultural and health needs. In Leeds, any English-speaking, asylum-seeking and refugee mothers can apply to be befrienders. Successful applicants undergo four training sessions, which cover listening and empowerment skills, as well as understanding how health and maternity care differs across cultures. In 2011, 74 women speaking 30 different languages were recruited as volunteers and matched with 180 women in Leeds, referred by midwives, children's centres and community refugee organisations. Research carried out after the first year showed that every woman involved reported a higher sense of wellbeing. Funding for the scheme ended in 2014 - but three months ago, McCarthy managed to revive the programme, specifically to support the 419 Syrians who have been resettled in the Yorkshire and Humberside region since October 2015. Her old volunteers have flooded back, along with new ones. Since September, McCarthy has recruited and trained 40 volunteers. The first three befriending pairs have already been matched. With 1,340 Syrians expected to settle in the region over the next two to three years, ""there is a big appetite for it"", she says. *** When Alia arrived in the UK this year, she had to hide the fact that she was more than eight months pregnant: she feared being banned from the flight. She was fleeing the genocide in Darfur, Sudan (where an estimated 480,000 people have now been killed ), to meet her husband, who had already made the arduous journey and settled in Leeds. ""I took her to the local children's centres, and to antenatal classes,"" says Muna, a volunteer befriender, and another Darfur refugee, who met Alia within days of her arrival. Then one evening her phone rang. ""Her husband was crying,"" Muna remembers. ""He said: 'We're at the hospital and they say there is an infection. The baby is in danger. We need an emergency caesarean but Alia won't consent.'"" While Muna tells their story, Alia quietly nurses her five-month-old son, Sammy. ""I was scared,"" she says softly, with Muna as her translator. ""Where we come from, when you do this sort of operation, either the baby or the mother dies."" ""So I ran,"" says Muna. ""I dropped everything and ran all the way to the hospital. I didn't see the cars. Everything was a blur."" This wasn't just any running: Muna had competed in the 800m for Sudan in the 2008 Olympic Games. Minutes later, she was at Alia's bedside. ""I knew nothing about caesareans. I was terrified,"" she says. ""But I held her hand and I said: 'You must do this and I will go in with you. I will talk to you while they do it, and you can talk to me, and the baby will be fine.'"" The two women went into theatre together. Moments later, Sammy was born, a greenish blue, but alive. ""When it was over, I cried,"" says Muna, ""I could stop being brave for her. Afterwards, I was with her every day, I helped her with breastfeeding, how to bathe the baby - I am like her second mum.""

Often, however, three hours turn into much more, and partnerships turn into lifelong friendships. Many befriended women end up as volunteers themselves. Luisa, for example, has become a vocal campaigner for the scheme. ""Last week I chaired a debate,"" she says, smiling. ""I've spoken in parliament, in conferences and schools. I even went to Glastonbury festival to talk."" Other women have gone on to find paid jobs after volunteering. ""There's nothing like this work,"" Dasha says. ""It gives you such self-confidence, a feeling of doing good."" She now works for the council, providing information about housing support. As midwives become increasingly overstretched, McCarthy hopes that similar schemes could be introduced across the UK. ""Befrienders make the most enormous difference,"" she says. ""They are figures of trust for women who may be scared to trust others."" I leave the group of women chatting and giggling, and cooing over Sammy, who is now sleeping soundly.

Announcing the global humanitarian appeal on Monday, Valerie Amos, UN under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said 2015 was going to be an incredibly difficult year for 57.5 million of the world's most vulnerable people. ""Over 80% of those we intend to help are in countries mired in conflict where brutality and violence have had a devastating impact on their lives,"" she said. ""We will continue to put people at the centre of our relief efforts and do everything we can to respond quickly and effectively, but the rising scale of need is outpacing our capacity to respond.""  This year has seen a sharp rise in the number of people affected by conflict, with millions forced to flee their homes and left dependent on humanitarian aid. Although the appeal also covers Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma, the occupied Palestinian territories, Somalia, Sudan, Ukraine and Yemen, more than 70% of the amount requested is needed for relief efforts in CAR, Iraq, South Sudan and Syria. A significant portion of the requested funds would go to trying to alleviate the Syrian crisis, with $2.8bn intended to help 12.2 million inside the country and a further $4.4bn needed to help 6 million Syrian refugees in five asylum countries. The UN estimates that the war in Syria has killed 191,000 people, displaced 7.6 million internally and compelled another 3.2 million to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.  Last week, the World Food Programme suspended the distribution of food vouchers to hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees after it failed to secure the necessary funding from the international community. It warned that the impact could be devastating for a displaced population facing a harsh winter. Conflict and insecurity in Iraq have displaced more than 2.1 million people across the country and left 5.2 million in need of aid - of whom 2.2 million are in areas under the control of Isis. In South Sudan, where civil war broke out a year ago, 1.5 million people are severely food insecure, while the sectarian violence that has plagued CAR since March has left a quarter of the population - more than 1 million people - displaced within its borders or in neighbouring countries. ""This is not business as usual in the humanitarian world,"" said António Guterres, the UN high commissioner for refugees. ""Today's needs are at unprecedented levels, and without more support there simply is no way to respond to the humanitarian situations we're seeing in region after region and in conflict after conflict.""  The numbers of those in need is likely to rise in February, when the UN launches strategic response plans for Djibouti and nine countries in the Sahel region. Last December, the UN appealed for the then-unprecedented sum of $12.9bn for 2014 as it tried to deal with Syria, CAR and the aftermath of typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The demand for this year has now risen to $17.9bn, of which international donors have provided $9.4bn. ""Every year we ask our donors to do more - and they do. But as crises become more complex and go on longer, the gap between needs and resources grows,"" said Amos.  ""I hope we can close it in 2015 because if we don't raise the money it means that we are able to help fewer children, women and men with medicine, food and shelter; the basics they need to survive.""

The UN refugee agency ""warmly welcomed"" Australia's humanitarian assistance, which includes a pledge of $44m to help shelter and clothe people as winter approaches, but the agency reiterated the sheer scale of the ""tragedy of our time"" as millions of desperate people flee violence and many children miss years of schooling.  Related: Is it legal for Australia to bomb Syria? Five facts you need to know The prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced on Wednesday that the one-off allocation of 12,000 places would be on top of Australia's existing annual humanitarian intake of 13,750 - bowing to pressure from ministers, backbenchers, state premiers, other political parties and community members to increase the overall quota to help the plight of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Abbott said he ""didn't want to rush into something before receiving advice"" and it was ""important that we act with our head as well as with our heart here"". The prime minister also confirmed on Wednesday that Australian strike aircraft - which have been involved in coalition bombing raids in Iraq since 2014 - would expand their missions into Syria within a week on the basis of ""collective self-defence"" of Iraq. Using an alternative name for Isis, Abbott emphasised that Australian operations would be ""targeting Daesh, not the Assad regime, evil though it is"". ""What we want throughout the Middle East are governments that do not commit genocide against their own people, nor permit terrorism against ours,"" he said. Labor pledged its support for the increased refugee intake and for the expanded airstrikes, although it urged the government to convene a parliamentary debate and explain ""their long-term strategy regarding Australia's changing role in the defence of Iraq"".  Related: First of the extra 12,000 refugees could arrive in Australia before Christmas The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, told parliament: ""There are legitimate demands to understand the exit strategy. And to ask, what does success look like? To ask, what kind of peace we are seeking to build?"" Minor parties and independents were more forthright in warning about the lack of a clear strategy. The leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale, said the government had failed to learn from the previous Iraq war and risked making a bad problem worse. ""There is no legal basis for airstrikes in Syria and there is no clear strategy,"" he said. The independent MP Andrew Wilkie said Australia was recklessly allowing itself ""to be drawn deeper and deeper into the broader Middle East civil war"". But the government received plaudits from across the political spectrum for the extra intake of refugees. The first of the extra 12,000 Syrian refugees should arrive in Australia before Christmas as officials crank up a $700m process to select, check and resettle them. Amin Awad, the UNHCR's bureau director for the Middle East and north Africa, thanked Abbott for the contribution, saying the resettlement of refugees and extra funding were both ""very important and they go hand in hand"".  Related: This could be the largest refugee resettlement intake in Australia's postwar history - here's what it means But in a briefing for Australian MPs on Wednesday evening, Awad also underlined the severity of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. He noted there were more than 4m registered Syrian refugees in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and other countries. Many had been content being close to their home country for the past three or four years, hoping the situation would be resolved, but were now on the move and risking dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean sea because ""desperation had set in and hopelessness"". ""Children missed school for the last five years,"" Awad said, suggesting the education gap represented a lost generation. ""Five years is a long time."" Awad called for ""a peace agreement to stop all of this"". At the same briefing, the Unicef ambassador Tara Moss said until now it had ""been incredibly difficult to get the public's attention and the attention of change-makers"" about the plight of refugees in the region. ""The conflict in Syria is the world's largest humanitarian crisis today,"" she said. ""It is a children's crisis. More than half of the refugees are kids.""

""That just pricked this bubble of indifference and suddenly we're going 'He's innocent; these people are innocent',"" Costello said. The Liberal MP Craig Laundy, who had been pushing for the government to increase its refugee intake, said he hoped ""that today we've seen the Australian heart"".

Researchers from Yale University say the women, living in north Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, are not able to access the basic reproductive healthcare they need. Those who are pregnant are not getting antenatal checks, while others have untreated infections. Some of their health problems are linked to conflict-related stress, which also manifests itself in domestic violence. Some women reported being hit by their husbands and also lashing out themselves at their children, which they bitterly regretted. ""I feel like I need a psychiatrist. I've been beating my child abnormally, and when he sleeps I regret it and cry, yet the next day I get tense and beat him again,"" said one woman. But while their situation is difficult, Amelia Masterson, lead author of the study in the journal BMC Women's Health, said the women support each other in their adversity. ""Though most of the stories we heard from Syrian women were grim, many women were facing hardship with great resilience and strength,"" she told the Guardian. ""Women spoke of helping each other out with basic needs, taking care of children while their husbands were away in Syria, and receiving help or even a place to stay from the local Lebanese population."" One of the women spoke of her gratitude to the people of Lebanon: ""Here, they give us hummus, pasta, beans, rice and canned food. We thank them and thank everyone who helped us including the people of Wadi Khaled, as we know they are not responsible for us."" Masterson and colleagues carried out a needs assessment at the request of the UN Population Fund. They interviewed 452 women, aged 18 to 45, who had been in Lebanon for an average of five months. The interviews were carried out between June and August 2012, when there were 48,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The situation is now likely to be even harder as the numbers have swollen and there are about a million refugees, a quarter of whom are women. Almost a third of the women - 139 - reported experiencing violence in the Syrian conflict and almost all of them (95.7%) said the perpetrator was armed. Fourteen said they had been subjected to sexual violence in Syria by an armed person. Seventy-four women had been pregnant during the conflict and just under half had delivered, the study says. Among the completed pregnancies, nearly a quarter (23.7%) had been pre-term births, four had been miscarriages or induced abortions (10.5%) and one baby died. There were complications in over a third (36.8%). Of those currently pregnant, more than a third (39.5%) reported problems such as severe abdominal pain, bleeding and fever.

The vessel, which can fit up to 2,500 people, will function as a floating registration centre. Officials hope its presence will speed up the processing of about 7,000 refugees who are stranded on Kos after making the short boat journey from Turkey, and to whom the authorities have been previously unable to provide paperwork or housing.  Related: 10 truths about Europe's migrant crisis The move follows a disastrous attempt to register refugees inside an old stadium on Tuesday and Wednesday, which led to up to 2,500 mainly Syrian migrants trapped in the stadium grounds. For more than 12 hours, much of it in temperatures of about 35C, migrants were without access to water or toilets. This led some to faint at a rate of one every 15 minutes, according to Médecins Sans Frontières, an aid agency providing medical support outside the stadium. By dawn on Thursday, the last migrants were finally released in calm circumstances witnessed by the Guardian, but some were literally bruised by the experience after clashes broke out on Wednesday between confused refugees and panicking police officers. Youssef, a 29-year-old Syrian banker, criticised the undignified nature of the process after being released early on Thursday morning. ""I have a bachelor's degree in accounting and an MBA,"" he said. ""It's a shame to treat us like this."" Registered migrants like Youssef are still stuck on Kos, with up to 5,000 others yet to be processed. The situation has led the Greek government to send a cruise liner, the Eleftherios Venizelos, to mitigate the fallout - as hundreds more refugees arrive every day. Kos's mayor, Giorgos Kyritsis, who made the decision to use the stadium, denied that the ship would simply be yet another place of limbo for refugees. Kyritis said: ""It's not going to be used as a camp. As soon as it is filled with migrants, the ship with depart and another ship will come.""

The prime minister's promise was made back in October, amid growing criticism of the government's response to the unfolding crisis in the Mediterranean. It followed an earlier announcement that the UK would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees after photographs of the body of three-year old Aylan Kurdi washed up on a beach near Bodrum in Turkey - a harrowing image, which triggered a wave of public support and demands for the UK to do more to provide protection for those fleeing the conflict.  In this season of goodwill, the news that the first wave of refugees has been accommodated is to be welcomed but the sudden evolution of UK resettlement policy comes after years of foot dragging. The conflict in Syria, which started back in March 2011, has led to the deaths of around 250,000 people and displaced more than 10m, around 4.5m of whom have left the country.  Until January 2014, the government's policy was to be generous with humanitarian aid to Syria's neighbours rather than to accept refugees for resettlement. Then, under pressure from charities and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the government established a Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement (VPR) Programme to provide a route for selected Syrian refugees to come to the UK. The government committed itself to resettling ""several hundred"" Syrian refugees over a three-year period. Just 187 people were resettled in the period to June 2015.  A significant proportion of those people were resettled in Coventry, where the local response has been welcoming, supportive and inclusive, drawing on a high level of community support and committed community leadership teams.  This work has not always been easy or straightforward. Whilst the Home Office covers the direct costs associated with resettlement, it is down to local authorities to mobilise the necessary staff and local resources to find homes for families and school places for children. The fact that more than 50 local authorities have now done so is a significant achievement. But it is important to remember the scale of the crisis and how much more remains to be done.  Since the beginning of 2015 nearly 1 million people have crossed the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas in search of protection or a better life. Germany has taken in 760,000 asylum seekers this year with a third of all arrivals coming from Syria. The UK, protected from the crisis by its geographical location, will not participate in the refugee relocation schemes being developed by the EU to address the needs of those who have already arrived in Europe, arguing that this will simply encourage others to make the dangerous journey. And questions remain about what will happen once Christmas is over, when people return to their desks to find that the pressure to deliver the prime minister's vow is no longer driving the resettlement agenda. Will the efforts continue at the same pace? And will refugees be provided with the long-term support needed to rebuild their lives?  To be successful, resettlement must do more than meet immediate basic needs. One of the primary needs is to learn English which not only increases the chances of getting a job but also enables individuals to understand their rights and obligations as a citizen of a society and provides an opportunity to meet others in the community, reducing isolation. Yet across the country English language courses are being cut back due to the government's £45m cut in the Esol budget.  Refugees fleeing conflict and war have significant, and often unmet, mental health needs. Resettlement brings its own challenges: isolation from friends and family; guilt and anxiety about those left behind; poor living conditions; difficulties in accessing services; and hostility from some members of the community and sections of the British press (contrast that story with this one ). But the UK's mental health care system is in crisis and it seems unlikely that refugees will easily be able to access existing services.  Meanwhile the Overseas Development Aid (ODA) budget which is being used to fund the programme can only be used to support people for their first 12 months in the UK. All of which raises important questions about how resettled refugees will get the long-term support that they need.  So as we head off to join our families and friends for a week of overindulgence, we should remember that for the Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the UK, one journey may have ended but another has only just begun. And it will last well beyond Christmas.  Ensuring that the UK meets its international obligations towards those fleeing the conflict in Syria will require more than prime ministerial pledges. We will all need to dig deep and find ways to harness the widespread public support shown over recent months to increase the scale and depth of our commitment.

The quota for Australia's initial additional resettlement of 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq - external to its annual humanitarian intake of 13,750 - has been filled.   All 12,000 visas have been assigned, according to the latest federal government figures, and more than 10,400 refugees have arrived in the country as part of the program.   Related: Malcolm Turnbull tells Russia to pull Bashar al-Assad into line after US missile strikes Oxfam Australia's chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke, said that, ""considering the success"" of Australia's resettlement of the initial 12,000, and the ongoing outflow of refugees fleeing the conflict, the Australian government was well-placed to resettle more people.  ""The international community seems intent on watching on as millions of people are stuck between the rock that their country has become and the hard place that exile offers them,"" she said.  ""Oxfam calls on rich countries to show their support for Syria's neighbours that have welcomed these refugees and to resettle at least the most vulnerable 10% of Syrian refugees by the end of 2017."" A former Australian ambassador to Syria, Bob Bowker, said Australia was in a position to accept more refugees from the conflict in that country. ""I would like to see Australia doing much more to accept Syrian refugees that have been assessed as such and provide more support in local communities to assist their settling into Australia.""  Bowker, plenipotentiary to Damascus from 2005 to 2008, said ""the Australian community will benefit"" from accepting more refugees - particularly those that are well-supported in their initial months in the country - and that the experience of the current cohort was that younger refugees adapt better, and more quickly, to their new country.  But he said Australia needed to accept refugees from the conflict on the basis of those in most acute need of protection, not on any sectarian division.  ""Our response needs to be based on our common humanity, not on the basis of religious affiliation.""

In the same 12 months those countries had settled 10,000 and 30,000 refugees under additional intakes respectively, Australia had accepted just 2,000.  There were also concerns that Australia, in identifying persecuted minorities for resettlement, had preferenced Christians over refugees of other religions.  Both Iraq and Syria are Muslim-majority countries and, while Christians in those nations face religious persecution, Muslims, both from sectarian minorities and majorities, are also significantly persecuted. There was concern that, once in Australia, too many refugees were being resettled in too few areas : in particular Fairfield and Liverpool in Sydney's west, Hume in north-western Melbourne and Logan, south of Brisbane. In February, the Fairfield city mayor, Frank Carbone, said his council had resettled one fifth of all of Australia's humanitarian migrants last financial year. Nearly 5,000 refugees moved into the area, the equivalent of an entire suburb's population. ""More funding needs to be provided locally for better coordination of services and to ensure job creation, housing, health and youth services are adequate,"" he said. Governments, state and federal, responded, with additional funding for resettlement, health and education services. The federal government has sought to reform and streamline its humanitarian settlement program, to prioritise integration and independence. "" Central to this reform is improving English, education and employment outcomes, ensuring humanitarian arrivals have the best chance at thriving in Australia,"" the assistant minister for social services, Zed Seselja, said.",Broadsheet,0,2017-04,1,Migration
956,src_theguardian_raw1.docx,The Guardian,1/12/2014,962 words,Ian Black in Amman,Patience running out in Jordan after influx of Syrian refugees; Jordan has been widely praised for its efforts but there is hostility towards the million-plus Syrians who have fled war,"In a cramped radio studio in central Amman, a team of journalists is preparing to broadcast the lunchtime news bulletin. The first item is about human trafficking and underage marriage among Syrian refugees in Jordan. Next up is an interview with the mayor of Ramtha, a Jordanian border town whose economy has been paralysed by the war raging in Syria. And finally a listener phones in to complain about begging by Syrians in the northern city of Mafraq. This familiar mix represents another day in the life of Suriyoun Baynana (Syrians Among Us), a programme designed to help one small Arab country cope with the enormous strain caused by the crisis ravaging its larger neighbour. Hosted by Radio Balad, a community radio network, it covers the refugee story while trying to counter hostility towards the million-plus Syrians who have fled to Jordan since the uprising against Bashar al-Assad erupted in 2011. The existence of the programme is itself a rare bit of good news in the general gloom about Syria. Hazem al-Mazouni, a democracy activist in Hama before he escaped, now reports on the lives of his fellow countrymen in exile even as the Jordanian authorities implement tougher policies. Right now his concern is about thousands of refugees who are stranded in no man's land near a remote desert border post, facing snakes, scorpions and unbearable uncertainty about the future. ""They are having to manage on one 200ml bottle of water a day,"" Mazouni says. ""Eight people have died there in the last two months, and one of them was a seven-year-old child."" Radio Balad has no shortage of news. ""People here are surprised to hear about how hard the situation is for the Syrian refugees,"" says Doha Barqawi, a Jordanian editor. ""We have a lot of reports about violence against women and children and problems in schools. It's all bad."" The UNHCR records 640,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan, though the government says the total number of Syrians is double that. The costs are huge for a poor country that is short of water, faces crippling energy costs and suffers the highest youth unemployment in the Arab world. Many schools are operating double shifts to accommodate Syrian children. Health services are overwhelmed. Syrians, many of them highly skilled, are prepared to work for lower wages than Jordanians and even Egyptian guest workers. Rents and prices have risen astronomically. Unhappiness, frustration and anger are heard everywhere. ""We have received the lower end of Syrian society,"" complains a middle-class Palestinian. ""In Arabic we say a fish stinks after three days. But this could go on for years."" The Syrians are the third big wave of refugees to enter Jordan since independence in 1946. First came the Palestinians - those who lost their homes when Israel was created in 1948, and a second exodus in the wake of the 1967 war. Iraqis arrived in 1991 and again in 2003. The uprising against Assad opened another massively disruptive chapter. ""The problem with Jordan,'"" an Amman-based diplomat says drily, ""is that refugees do tend to stay."" Jordan has been widely praised for its efforts - and received substantial cash flows to help it cope - but its patience is clearly running out. Lebanon, which has taken in 1.2 million Syrians, announced this month that it was barring entry to all but ""exceptional"" cases. The Jordanian government insists its border remains open. But a marked change has taken place in the last few weeks. The UNHCR recorded 6,000 refugees in September and just 250 in November. ""The numbers have petered out,"" says one official. ""They have slowed from a trickle to almost nothing."" Security concerns explain why. For the first two years of the crisis, most Syrians entering Jordan came from central and southern Syria, especially the Dera'a area. In recent months the two westernmost border crossings were closed, so newer arrivals came from further north and east, from around Aleppo, Hassake and Deir el-Zor - partially or wholly under the control of the Islamic State. ""In the end the security imperative is overwhelming the humanitarian arguments,"" says Andrew Harper, head of the UNHCR's busy office in Amman. The irony is that the UNHCR now has spare capacity in a new camp near Azraq, built when the first one at Zaatari was full. Jordanian officials bristle at criticism, arguing that EU countries are in no position to preach about refugee policy when they have just ended support for the Mare Nostrum operation to rescue migrants from drowning in the Mediterranean. ""Do we have to prove our credentials?"" asks Mohammed al-Momani, the government's chief spokesman. ""We are doing more than any other country in the world."" Rumours abound of Jordan working with the anti-Assad Free Syrian Army to keep refugees away from the border. Officials in Amman point out that emergency food deliveries by the UN, now being made without the agreement of the Syrian government, are relieving pressure. Evidence is accumulating of efforts by the Jordanian authorities to force Syrians to move from private accommodation into camps or face deportation. Human Rights Watch said in late November that the Jordanian authorities had forcibly deported vulnerable Syrian refugees back to Syria, in violation of Jordan's international obligations. Last week it was reported that medical care was being denied to refugees. The issue is certain to come up in talks between King Abdullah and Barack Obama in Washington this week. ""Jordan has done far more than anyone could have possibly expected a small state to do,"" the UNHCR's Harper says. ""It has done an outstanding job, but there are limits to its capacity. If we are struggling in 2014 to find the resources, where will we be in 2015 and 2016 and beyond? No one has a timeline for this conflict.""",Broadsheet,0,2014-12,1,Conditions

Ferries carrying migrants to the Greek mainland, where many continue their journey onwards to western Europe, have not been running for four days because of an industrial dispute. The stoppage has disrupted the chaotic flow of refugees on the island, seeing its two registration camps pushed to their limits while thousands of asylum seekers sleep rough or in ramshackle tents lining the port in Mytilene, hoping to make the first departure. Officials from the United High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said at least 10,000 people were likely to be trapped on Lesbos by the end of the week, although estimates of the number ran to more than double that amount in the Greek media. Alessandra Morelli, UNHCR's senior operations coordinator for Greece, told  The Independent  that three ferries with a combined capacity of 5,000 were standing ready to start transfers to Athens as soon as the strike is due to end at 6am on 6 November. ""Lesbos isn't meant to cater for this - it's meant to cater for tourists,"" she added. ""The infrastructure is poor. It's an extraordinary situation."" Thousands of asylum seekers are still arriving on flimsy dinghys from Turkey every day, despite worsening weather conditions exacerbating the risk of accidents like the one that killed three children on 4 November. The new arrivals can be seen walking for miles in endless streams along the island's roads, as well as waiting for buses in hundreds-strong crowds, all heading for Lesbos' two registration centres. But Kara Tepe - for Syrians - and Moria - for asylum seekers from other nations - are struggling to deal with rapidly rising numbers trapped on the island in worsening conditions by the ongoing strike. ""They are stretched to the limit but they aren't cracking yet,"" Ms Morelli said, describing work to increase capacity with more cabins and new airport-style reception areas to make the process ""effective and dignified"". The Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, was on hand to witness the effect of the bottleneck while visiting the Moria refugee camp with the European Union President, Martin Schulz, today. Many of its 4,000 current inhabitants, mainly from Afghanistan, were sleeping in tents or on the bare ground while struggling with limited supplies and risking infection from overflowing latrines. Refugees were held behind crowd barriers as the Prime Minister and Mr Schulz passed through, surrounded by a crowd of media and minders. But one man managed to make his voice heard, shouting: ""We are here three days. We are hungry. I have two children, my children are sick."" ""We will do our best,"" Mr Tsipras replied, patting his arm before being ushered away. Efforts by his shipping minister to persuade union leaders not to extend their strike, which was originally scheduled for 48 hours, failed but the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO) has committed to re-starting transfers tomorrow. The nationwide strike has seen ferries docked across Greece, on routes used by local people, businesses, cargo and tourists. Organisers said they had no new demands but were taking a stand against the government's bailout agreement and austerity measures, opposing pension cuts and rising unemployment rates in the shipping industry. Mr Tsipras, who saw a refugee boat arrive while journeying through Lesbos, called it a ""suffocating situation"". Meanwhile, the number of arrivals stands at around 5,000 a day and is not expected to go down as weather conditions worsen through the winter, with smugglers reportedly offering off-season discounts. UNHCR figures show that of the almost 609,000 asylum seekers reaching Greece this year, 353,000 arrived in Lesbos - which has a native population of just 86,000. Ms Morelli said the UN would ""not let its guard down"", while Save the Children, Doctors Without Borders, the Red Cross, Oxfam, International Rescue Committee and numerous other charities and volunteer groups are running their own operations.

We were still in denial: ""swarm"" territory. That column was the most shared and commented on I've ever written. As one might expect of i and independent.co.uk readers, there was some sympathy for the refugees. That said, watching Germans greeting Syrian refugees in Munich this weekend with sweets, water, teddy bears and applause, I puzzled again over the relatively unsympathetic British response. It was bemusing to be tagged ""a leftie"" just for expressing sympathy.

READ MOREFive practical ways you can help refugees'Not angry about the refugee crisis? Here's a history lesson' One reason why some have chosen to view what are obviously refugees as ""merely"" economic migrants is that many don't conform to our stereotype of refugees. Regardless of the images of Homs, Aleppo or Kobane today - think post-blitz London, but worse - and despite the survivor stories, it appears being rescued from the sea or a dangerous march along a motorway aren't enough for some to accept their ""desperate"" status. This interpretation goes: they're not that desperate - because they are not in rags or obviously famished. But isn't that the point? The destruction of Syrian (or Iraqi) cities and Isis terror are indiscriminate. Muslims, Christians and Kurds are all dying or fleeing. Doctors and teachers have their homes destroyed - just as market traders and kitchen staff do. It took one teenage Syrian boy among the many interviewed this past week to sum it up: ""What do we want? To stop the war"" And then, he continued, Syrians would not be fleeing Syria, their home.

3869,src_theindependent_raw5.docx,The Independent,3/9/2015,747 words,Holly Baxter,Why we've decided to call it Europe's refugee crisis; Rather than Europe's migrant problem,"Europe is seeing a crisis at the moment, but nobody can agree on what sort of crisis it is. If you believed some of the language used by British politicians - David Cameron's description of those arriving in Calais as a 'swarm', for instance, or Philip Hammond's characterisation of them as a group of people 'marauding around' who will threaten Europe's 'standard of living and social structure' if allowed to settle in the UK - then you might be forgiven for thinking that this is a crisis for Britain or Western Europe; that it's just an immigration problem which can be solved with more dogs and bigger, reinforced fences. According to commentators like Katie Hopkins, who infamously referred to those rescued from sinking boats in the Mediterranean as 'cockroaches', then the solution is little more than a large-scale exercise in pest control. The truth is that the crisis isn't ours at all. Those in crisis are not the citizens of Western European towns faced with the prospect of Syrian refugees moving in nearby. Those in crisis are the people so desperate to escape hardship, war, persecution and poverty that they have made a notoriously treacherous journey to Europe. The risks of this journey are myriad and real: in the last seven days alone, 71 refugees were found dead inside an abandoned lorry on the side of the road in Austria, and 50 were asphyxiated inside the hold of a boat off the coast of Libya. Thousands have drowned, suffocated, died of thirst or starved. In April, it was reported by the International Organisation for Migration that the death toll in the Mediterranean was already 30 times higher than it had been in 2014. In recognition of the fact that this is a humanitarian crisis of international proportions, rather than a British problem, the Independent will no longer be using the term 'migrant crisis' when 'refugee crisis' can be employed instead. In the last few months, semantics have become very important when addressing the plight of people crossing the ocean to seek a better life for themselves in Europe - and 'migrant' has become synonymous with 'problem' or 'member of the swarm'. The context of its usage, especially in politics, has allowed the word to be dehumanising. While its definition is supposedly neutral, meaning someone who leaves their home country for economic reasons, we now feel that it is sufficiently contentious to cease using it as a descriptive term for the entire crisis except when absolutely necessary. Refugees will be referred to as such, while those who do technically meet the definition of migrant will be merely referred to as 'people' where possible. However, there will be some instances when we choose to use the term 'migrant crisis'. In this way we hope to counteract the way in which 'migrant' or 'migrant crisis' is now being used by other media to scaremonger and to stir up hatred and suspicion toward desperate people. We are proud of the way that we have chosen to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Europe and the plight of these refugees. In articles such as 'It's time to stop the politics of fear and treat these people like human beings', 'No, Philip Hammond, migrants don't threaten our standard of living - your policies do', 'Don't call Calais a migrant problem: it's a humanitarian crisis', and 'In treating needy refugees like invaders, we risk losing our humanity', we have continually emphasised the need for the British government to show their compassion and responsibility towards people who have fled impossible and unbearable situations. We will continue to give a platform to those who write with empathy and humanity about refugees across the continent, and we hope that by rejecting the use of 'migrant' as a catch-all description in our articles we can also preserve the dignity of people who have been continually attacked, dehumanised and insulted in the UK press and UK politics.

Mr Cameron made the policy U-turn following mounting political pressure - including from Tory backbenchers. The move came after Lord Dubs, who came to Britain on the Kindertransport programme for Jewish children escaping the Nazis, tabled an amendment to a Bill which would have forced the Government to accept 3,000 child refugees.

Some, like The Voice star Ora, are themselves refugees. Her family fled the persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, settling in the UK in 1991 when she was one year old. Others, like broadcaster and co-founder of Help Refugees Lliana Bird, have ancestors who were forced to leave their home countries.

Read more Migrants with legal right to be in UK 'face exclusion and hostility' The last-minute demands came while they met at a summit in Brussels as leaders tried to agree measures to halt the flow of migrants crossing the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. Last year's refugee crisis led to a 126 per cent increase in detentions at the UK's main holding facility at Dover Seaport last year, the report by HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) says. In the first nine months of 2014, there were 2,118 detentions, while in 2015 the figure had increased to 4,785. In the three months to the end of September alone, there had been 2,781 detentions. In addition, 822 men were held at an overflow facility in Folkestone called Frontier House. The combined total is equivalent to 40 people being stopped every day. David Cameron refers to Calais as 'bunch of migrants' Throughout the summer migrants massed in Calais made thousands of attempts to reach Britain, with a number dying as they tried to make the journey. The crisis was said to have cost the economy millions of pounds as hauliers were forced to dispose of contaminated goods and wait in lengthy queues on the M20 in Kent. HMIP described the response to high numbers of migrants arriving through the Channel Tunnel as ""inadequate"", saying the basic physical needs of detainees were not met and conditions lacked decency. Their report said the Dover Seaport facility was ""crowded, poorly ventilated and smelled badly"". A child stands among razor-wire fencing on the Greek-Macedonian border near the Greek village of Idomeni (AFP) It was not designed to hold people for more than a few hours but over the summer detainees were held for an average of 18 hours.

""The events of the summer and early autumn of 2015, in terms of the numbers of migrants arriving through the Channel Tunnel were indeed unprecedented, but in light of the build-up of activity over several months they were not unpredictable."" The HMIP report said Dover Seaport and Frontier House are contracted out to the private security firm Tascor. A spokesman for the company said: ""Despite the unprecedented influx of migrants in the Dover area, Tascor worked with the Home Office in order to ensure detainee welfare was not compromised.

People who have fled Syria and are resettled in Britain under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme ( VPRS ) will for the first time be granted refugee status, enabling them to access certain rights that have previously been barred to them, including higher education and overseas travel documents. Syrian refugees in the UKhave previously been given a special form of leave to remain called Humanitarian Protection, which prevented them from accessing services that are granted to those with refugee status. Read more Government blocks entry to disabled child refugees Labour peer has taken in Syrian refugee after visiting Calais jungle No, Syrian refugees cannot return to Aleppo They faced a three-year wait before being eligible for student finance, which put university out of reach of many, and were also unable to apply for the same travel documents as other refugees, which resulted in Syrians being unable to easily go abroad to visit their family in other countries. In a written ministerial statement published on Wednesday, the Home Secretary said that while the decision to grant Humanitarian Protection rather than Refugee Leave to Syrians fleeing war was ""right at the time"", the Government has since recognised that it did not provide access to particular benefits and decided to grant them refugee status. ""At the beginning of the scheme, granting Humanitarian Protection allowed us to quickly assist and resettle the most vulnerable. As we have previously said, we have kept the policy under active review,"" read the statement. ""We have listened to those who have raised concerns about the consequences, for those we resettle to the UK, of granting Humanitarian Protection rather than Refugee Leave. We have also taken the time to work through the policy and practical implementation issues in detail. ""The decision to grant Humanitarian Protection was the right one at that time. However, while Humanitarian Protection recognises the need an individual has for international protection, it does not carry the same entitlements as refugee status, in particular, access to particular benefits. ""We think it is right to change the policy and now is the right time to make this change."" The statement said that from 1 July 2017, the Government would be granting those admitted under the VPRS and the VCRS refugee status and five years' limited leave, with those who are already resettled under these programmes given the opportunity to make a request to change their status from Humanitarian Protection to refugee status. Campaign groups who have been carrying out behind the scenes lobbying for resettled Syrians to have the same rights as people granted refugee status have welcomed the move, but said the previous policy was ""not enough"" from the start. Respondingto the announcement, Labour peer Baroness Lister , who has been asking questions about why the Government hasn't changed the policy in the House o f Lords since the start of the year, told The Independent: ""I'm delighted by the news. It's taken a long time, and there's been quite a lot of behind the scenes pushing and shoving. ""I can see the argument as to why the Government had originally applied Humanitarian Protection, because things had to move quickly, but they could then have moved faster as evidence was presented to them of the problems that this was creating.

Dr Lisa Doyle, d irector of a dvocacy at the Refugee  Council,a charity that has been campaigning for the change,said : ""The Refugee Council is delighted that refugees from Syria have finally been recognised as such by the Government. This news will open the door to university for thousands of Syrian refugees and enable people to be able to visit their loved ones in other countries.

The draft scheme aims to reduce the flow of refugees from war zones such as Syria by sending back to Turkey anyone landing illegally in Greece. But it has come under fire from EU leaders and aid agencies for being potentially illegal and impractical. ""I am cautiously optimistic, but frankly more cautious than optimistic,"" Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said before the two-day summit began. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, who helped strike last week's Turkish deal, admitted there were ""many things to resolve"", but expressed ""cautious optimism"". Read more Cameron must veto this poisonous deal with Turkey The 28 EU leaders are hoping to settle their negotiating stance before meeting Turkey's Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, over breakfast this morning. Ms Merkel says Turkey holds the key to resolving the crisis as it can seal the main route used by the 1.4 million asylum seekers who have landed in the bloc since January last year. David Cameron said he welcomed the plans to send migrants back to Turkey, as it would foil people smugglers. He added that because Britain is not in Europe's passport-free Schengen area, it will not offer visa-free travel to Turks. ""We maintain our own immigration policy,"" he said. Read more Refugees 'to be sent back within days' if Turkey deal goes through The deal would mean Turkey takes back all migrants arriving illegally in Greece, while the EU resettles one Syrian refugee for every Syrian readmitted to Turkey. The aim is ""to break the business model of the people smugglers"" and offer refugees an alternative to risking their lives. The one-for-one plan is a ""temporary and extraordinary measure"", to be capped at 72,000 migrants. At the same time, the EU would double an agreed (EURO)3bn fund to help refugees in Turkey and would hasten visa-free travel for Turks in Europe. Mark Rutte, the Netherlands Prime Minister, claimed the deal could cut the flow of migrants within three or four weeks. But Dalia Grybauskaite, the Lithuanian President, said the deal risked breaching the EU's international obligations to accept refugees. ""The proposed package is very complicated, will be very difficult to implement and is on the edge of international law,"" she said. She was echoed by Luxembourg's Prime Minister, Xavier Bettel, who said he had ""fears over the legal issues...you can't just put aside the Geneva Convention"". Read more Angelina Jolie says the plight of Syrian refugees is 'shameful' There are also concerns that Turkey is holding Europe to ransom, knowing how desperate leaders are to strike a deal before the spring weather entices more refugees to cross over.

Nicos Anastasiades, the Cypriot President, softened his stance on reopening Ankara's EU membership talks, having threatened to veto the entire deal over Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus. ""There are obstacles, but I do hope that...there is going to be a compromise,"" he said. The United Nations said that since the last EU-Turkey summit on 7 March, almost 11,000 people have reached Greece, bringing the total on that route to 144,000 so far this year; at least 96 have died trying. Q&A:The Turkey deal European leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron, are meeting in Brussels to thrash out a refugee swap with Turkey. The deal is fraught with potential pitfalls, with critics lambasting it as immoral, illegal and unworkable. Even European Council President Donald Tusk - who hosts the summit - admitted gloomily ""the catalogue of issues to be resolved is long"". Here are some of the questions that could derail the deal: Q.Is sending refugees back to Turkey illegal? A.  European Union countries are bound by the United Nations 1951 Convention on Refugees, which says all applications have to be properly reviewed, and asylum seekers cannot be returned to a country that does not offer proper protection. This is reiterated in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also bans collective expulsions. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel García-Margallo says the blanket return of refugees to Turkey is ""illegal under international law"". Q. Can Turkey be considered a 'safe' country? A. Only Europeans are currently guaranteed refugee status in Turkey: the EU's own rules say this does not meet its criteria as a ""safe"" third country for refugees. While Turkey currently hosts around 2.5 million Syrian refugees, human rights groups say Syrians are often sent back over the border into the war zone. While EU officials say Turkey will offer proper protection to all applicants, there is little evidence that Ankara will actually do it. Q.Why are the Cypriots blocking the deal? A. Cyprus President Nikos Anastasiades has pledged to veto the opening of five new ""chapters"" in Ankara's EU membership negotiations unless Turkey recognises the island as a single country. Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, and the island is still partitioned. Today, Turkey is the only country in the world to officially recognise Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state. This is especially sensitive for Cyprus, which is currently engaged in sensitive reunification talks with Northern Cyprus. Q.What is in it for the Turks? A. Turkey wants the EU to grant full visa-free travel for its citizens by the end of June. There is already resistance from EU leaders, wary of headlines suggesting 75 million Turks can visit any time. ""There cannot be any concessions on the matter of human rights or the criteria for visa liberalization"" French President François Hollande said. There are also technical demands: Turkey has to meet 72 benchmarks for visa-free access. It currently meets 35. Q.How long can Greece be expected to cope? A. European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans says all asylum seekers on Greek islands will get proper hearings, but that assumes Greece's asylum system is upgraded to cope with thousands of arrivals a week - an questionable scenario. Athens might need hundreds more judges and translators to process the applications. Greece also faces the challenge of removing 8,000 people from the islands in a matter of days. Q.What if resettlement fails? A. Last year, the EU agreed to resettle only 22,000 Syrian refugees over two years, a figure the UN called ""very low"" given that 4.8 million Syrians have fled their homes. Even so, only about 3,400 people have been found homes in 10 European countries. ""The swap model with Turkey is a non-scalable fantasy,"" says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, from the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""It defies belief that EU member states will be more willing to accept refugees directly from Turkey.""",Broadsheet,0,2016-03,0,Policy

After a a public outcry that saw more than 250,000 people backing The Independent's campaign for action, the Prime Minister said more information about the expanded resettlement scheme would be set out next week. A UN refugee agency spokeswoman suggested Britain would take in 4,000 people fleeing war-torn Syria, although Downing Street has refused to confirm the number or whether a figure has even been decided. And for millions of Syrians who have fled their country's civil war, time is not on their side. How many is ""thousands""? Where will they be located? Does he regret describing refugees as a ""swarm""? Will he support a pan-European effort to spread the burden of refugees away from Greece, Italy and Hungary? These are the four key questions we still need answers to.  1. How many?  Mr Cameron promises ""thousands more"" Syrian refugees will be given sanctuary in Britain, expanding the UK's current resettlement scheme that has granted just 216 places since it was set up last year. Anything less than 10,000 will be seen as a disappointment from the chorus of political leaders in the UK, a growing number of Tory MPs and even his own ministers. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary and Labour leadership candidate, has called for a figure of around 10,000. Falling short of this figure would be a dereliction of duty in the view of the United Nations, whose commissioner for refugees Antonio Guterres has told EU leaders that ""no country can refuse to do its part"" in his plan to relocate 200,000 refugees. Meanwhile, it would undermine Britain's relations with its neighbours, with Germany having admitted more than 35,000 refugees over the past year alone, with an estimated 800,000 expected to be given refuge by the end of the year. The Green party's demand that the UK accept 240,000 refugees may sound very ambitious, but it would still only account for a third of Germany's intake this year.  2. Where?  No details whatsoever have been mentioned by Downing Street as to where the ""thousands"" of Syrian refugees will be housed. Will these vulnerable people, who have lived through four years of war, be given access to the essential services they will be very much in need of? Ms Cooper made a speech earlier this week setting out a detailed proposal for the UK to accept 10,000 refugees by housing 10 families in each London borough. She is holding a meeting of local authorities, faith groups and voluntary organisations from across the country next week to work out what help they can provide. Co-ordinated Government action along these lines would go a long way to finding the places and safety that so many Syrians need.

Does the Prime Minister regret using the word 'swarm'?  Earlier this summer, Mr Cameron was accused of ""dehumanising"" refugees after he described the thousands of people trying to cross the Channel illegally from Calais as ""a swarm"". Harriet Harman, Labour's acting leader, told him he ""should remember he is talking about people, not insects"". The Prime Minister has yet to apologise for using such inflammatory language to describe one of the worst humanitarian crisis since the Second World War. Will he at least say he regrets using the word ""swarm""?   4. Will Britain support EU-wide project?  The expansion in the number of refugees Mr Cameron has promised to take in will be relocated from camps in the countries surrounding Syria and not any of the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have made it to Europe. It means the UK will not be helping countries such as Greece, Italy and Hungary who are forced to bear the burden of hundreds of thousands of refugees as they lie on the borders of the EU and are often the first EU country that refugees reach.  More than 220,000 refugees entered the EU in the first six months of this year alone, with that number increasing by the day. The out-dated Dublin Regulation requires refugees to seek asylum in the first country they reach, but Mr Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, this morning demanded that EU leaders agree to a pan-European project to relocate 200,000 refugees, saying: ""No country can do it alone, and no country can refuse to do its part.""  @matt_dathan  Refugees Welcome: Supporters back The Independent's campaign",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,0,Policy

Charities have long warned of smugglers abusing children, frequently forcing girls into prostitution to repay their ""debts"", but teenage asylum seekers in Sicily say they have been targeted by local men. Ermias Haile, a 16-year-old from Eritrea, has been sleeping on a building site with his friends since they arrived on the island after making the treacherous voyage from Libya. Like many others, they left an official reception centre for young refugees in the belief they would be forced to remain in Italy after applying from asylum, leaving them alone and unprotected. Ermias and friends told Sky News an Italian man had sexually abused them after buying them drinks and offering them shelter. ""He find us in a place like this [park] and he invite us to a bar and he let us drink beer and then he take us to his home and there he give us beer,"" he said. ""We start drinking and then he start touching us on our body. After we leave the house, he calls us and he gives us money."" Almost 102,000 asylum seekers have arrived by sea in Italy so far this year - 15 per cent of them unaccompanied minors. Most, such as Ermias, are picked up by rescue boats in the Mediterranean and taken to Sicily, where they are sent to local reception centres. But many leave the comparative safety of the accommodation, travelling to other European cities and often ending up homeless or trapped at borders such as in The Jungle camp in Calais, where several rapes have been reported. Save the Children said the number of unaccompanied children has doubled in the past year, seeing vulnerable boys and girls thrown into ""cycles of abuse"". Traffickers saddle girls and young women with up to Euro 50,000 (£43,000) in ""debt"" for the cost of their journeys across the Mediterranean before forcing them into prostitution and hard labour to pay it off. Boys are forced into similar schemes, subjected to child labour and criminal activity including theft and drug dealing by gangs. Children are also at risk at overcrowded detention camps on Greek islands, where all migrants are now held until their asylum applications are decided as part of a deal between the EU and Turkish government. Aid agencies say families are ""living in fear"" after fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries, with many afraid to let their children out of their sight amid rising tensions, protests and fights. Tanya Steele, Save the Children's interim CEO, said: ""It's shocking that in this day and age so many vulnerable children are being subjected to this kind of violence, manipulation and exploitation. ""They make the dangerous journey to Europe on their own seeking safety and a better life, but instead find themselves trapped in a cycle of abuse."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron responded to growing calls to house unaccompanied minors by pledging to resettle some of the ""most vulnerable"" refugee children in May, but none are believed to have arrived. The Home Affairs Select Committee has warned that the UK is on course to fall short of its pledge to house 20,000 Syrian refugees by 2020, highlighting a huge backlog of asylum cases and decisions where refugees had been wrongly returned to violence and persecution. The British Government previously restricted its scheme to asylum seekers in UN camps in the Middle East and North Africa, arguing that it did not want to encourage them to make the ""lethal"" sea voyage to Europe.",Broadsheet,0,2016-08,0,Migration

The UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) said he is believed to have fallen and hit his head on train tracks while running from police. Hungarian authorities had stopped the train in attempt to force refugees to go to a nearby camp to register their asylum applications. Those who resisted, like this woman and her young child, were met with physical force. The refugees stuck in Bicske included those who had already been stranded in Budapest for two days after police barred them from entering the capital's main station to catch trains to Germany and Austria. Those who eventually managed to get on trains had to be forcibly crammed inside, including young children and babies. Many of the refugees in Budapest have travelled along the long land migration route from the Middle East through the Balkans. Some, like this family of refugees from Afghanistan, walk for hundreds of miles along motorways through countries like Greece and Macedonia. Others risk their lives walking along rail lines. A man died on Friday when he was hit by a train as he walked along lines in northern Greece, near the border with Turkey, in the dark. The driver told police he could not brake in time. Smugglers are also packing refugees into lorries for long journeys through Europe. The bodies of 71 men, women and children were found in an abandoned truck in Austria last week.

What can the world do to stop the callous but efficient new strategy being used by the people traffickers? MICHAEL DAY reports Criminals netting $5m a trip 'have no hesitation jumping ship'","The Italian Coast Guard was last night towing the second unmanned ship containing hundreds of migrants to appear off its coast this week into port. The so-called ""ghost ships"" are a worrying new trend as human traffickers exploit desperate refugees bidding for a new life in Europe. The Lebanese vessel Ezadeen, which was discovered with about 450 passengers on board, is registered as a livestock vessel. But even cattle are not left to cross dangerous high seas in mid-winter with no crew and the vessel on autopilot. Coast Guard officers boarded the Ezadeen from a helicopter yesterday morning and navigated it towards Corigliano Calabro where it was due to arrive late last night. The practice of using ""ghost ships"" - filling rust buckets with refugees, pointing the vessel towards Italy and then fleeing with the passengers' life-savings - appears to be a worrying new development in human trafficking, the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, warned yesterday. The rescue of the Ezadeen follows a similar operation to save hundreds of migrants aboard another abandoned ship, the Blue Sky M, on Wednesday. ""We are seeing this new trend. It's apparent there have been other such incidents - maybe four or five in the past two months,"" said UNHCR spokesman William Spindler. ""But only when the Blue Sky M incident occurred this week, which involved nearly 1,000 people, did it capture everyone's attention."" Mr Spindler said it showed that human traffickers were changing tactics. ""They're using bigger boats and different routes to smuggle people. ""In the past they have come from Libya in dinghies and boats, but that route seems to have been closed by Frontex [the EU's border agency]."" Admiral Giovanni Pettorino of the Italian Coast Guard said that by charging hundreds of desperate refugees thousands of dollars at a time, gangs in North Africa and the Middle East were still able to make big profits by writing off ageing ships in the process of smuggling human beings. ""They purchase unseaworthy vessels for $100,000 to $150,000 (£65,000 to £97,000) and then fill them with hundreds of migrants, mainly Syrian nationals, who pay $6,000 each for the crossing from the Turkish coast to Europe,"" said Admiral Pettorino. He told the Adnkronos news agency that the criminals were netting up to $5m per trip and therefore ""had no hesitation about jumping ship, given the profit margins"". Last month the UNHCR described the Mediterranean crossing from the Middle East and Africa to Europe as ""the most lethal route in the world"" after a record 3,419 migrants lost their lives in 2014 crossing the sea. Although it has not been confirmed where the migrants aboard the Ezadeen come from, the UNHCR told The Independent it believed the number of refugees from Syria was rising sharply. In 2014 for the first time, people from refugee-producing countries - mainly Syria and Eritrea (as opposed to countries producing high numbers of economic migrants) - ""have become a major component in this tragic flow, accounting for almost 50 per cent of the total"", said the UN body. On Wednesday about 900, mostly Syrian, refugees arrived in Italy after they were abandoned by the crew of the Moldovan-registered Blue Sky M cargo ship, who had fled leaving the vessel on a crash course for the Italian coast. The Coast Guard also boarded that vessel and navigated it to port. The Blue Sky M drifted within five miles of the shore before six navy officers were lowered on to the ship by helicopter and succeeded in bringing it under control. One migrant aboard the 48-year-old Ezadeen, which is registered in Sierra Leone but has Lebanese owners, managed to operate the vessel's radio and contact the Italian Coast Guard on Thursday night. By this point the ship's crew had fled, leaving it to plough a The Coast Guard notified the nearby Icelandic patrol boat Tyr, which was in the area on a mission with Frontex. The Tyr drew alongside the runaway ship, but huge waves made boarding impossible. A Frontex spokesman said: ""It was not until some hours later, when the vessel carrying the migrants ran out of fuel, that five Icelandic officers were able to get on board, attach a tow rope and bring the ship under control."" Yesterday, six Italian Coast Guard officers were lowered from a helicopter on to the deck of the 73m-long Ezadeen to take control and navigate the vessel to the Italian mainland. Frontex said the migrants aboard were ""visibly distressed but overall in good medical condition"". They have been given food, water and basic medical assistance. Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marini said the nationality or nationalities of the migrants was not yet clear. He added: ""What is clear is that among them there were lots of children and women, including some pregnant women. What we know for now is that the ship left from a Turkish port and that the crew fled.""",Broadsheet,0,2015-01,0,Migration

David Cameron has said the UK will take 4,000 refugees a year for the next five years, a total of 20,000. These refugees will be drawn from people living in camps in countries neighboring Syria and people coming to Europe of their own accord will not be included. The UK has also opted out of a European Union scheme to relocate 120,000 migrants who have already travelled Europe.

But the Prime Minister is now under intense pressure to go further by accepting 500 refugees under a United Nations resettlement programme. Last night, Nick Clegg broke ranks with Mr Cameron by making public his private lobbying for a change of heart by the Government, which has refused to join the 18 Western countries who have signed up to the UN plan. The Deputy Prime Minister agrees with Labour that Britain should admit about 500 Syrians. He hopes to persuade Mr Cameron to change his mind before Labour forces a Commons vote on the issue next Wednesday. The Prime Minister's partial retreat came after Labour raised in the Commons the letter signed by 25 aid agencies and refugee groups, published in The Independent on Saturday, calling on the Government to think again. Mr Clegg said: ""I am full of admiration for the work The Independent has done in repeatedly raising awareness of this issue on its front page."" Aides revealed that the Liberal Democrat leader had been ""arguing for weeks"" inside the Government for the UK to back the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which wants Western nations to accept 30,000 of the 2.3 million Syrians who have fled their country. A source close to Mr Clegg said: ""We are one of the most open-hearted countries in the world and Nick believes we have a moral responsibility to help. He not only believes the moral case for doing this is overwhelming, he also thinks the political case for action is unarguable as well."" The source added: ""The Coalition Government has been the most generous in the world [after the US] when it comes to helping with the humanitarian crisis in Syria and it would be completely self-defeating to allow ourselves to be painted as the least generous. The Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case around the Cabinet table. We have yet to gain the agreement of our Conservative colleagues but we remain hopeful we will."" When Ed Miliband raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron told MPs: ""Where there are extreme hardship cases, I think we should look at this again."" He added: ""If there are cases of people who don't belong in refugee camps, who have either been disabled by these dreadful attacks, or are in very difficult circumstances, I am happy for us to look at that argument."" Mr Cameron said one child refugee was already being treated in a British hospital. But Downing Street was unable to say how many Syrians might be helped by his more flexible approach. Last night, it denied the Prime Minister had announced a change of policy. His official spokesman said: ""What we are doing is listening to the arguments about how we can help the most vulnerable people and we are going to do that and then set out how we propose to do that. We haven't taken final decisions around the best and the most effective way of doing that."" Mr Miliband was ""somewhat encouraged"" by Mr Cameron's move, saying the Government was ""gradually inching forward"". But Labour sources said it was ""shameful"" that the UK would still not join the UN resettlement programme. Yvette Cooper, the shadow Home Secretary, said: ""It is very disappointing that the Prime Minister was so resistant to signing up. Nearly every other European nation, the US and Australia are helping out. It is not a replacement for aid; it is additional help for the most vulnerable victims of war. There is cross-party support for doing more. We will hold a debate on this next week to show the Government the strength of feeling, and hope MPs from all parties will join us."" Earlier, Jim Murphy, the shadow International Development Secretary, quoted from the aid and refugee groups' letter, which asked: ""How can we call on Syria's neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees if we keep our own under lock and key?"" Mark Pritchard, one of several Tory MPs pressing for a full U-turn, said: ""I hope a cross-party consensus can guide the UK's humanitarian response and the refugee issue doesn't become a party-political issue. The Government does appear to be softening its policy, which is welcome."" Mr Cameron told the Commons: ""I don't believe you can solve a refugee crisis of this scale - when you've got almost half the nine million population of Syria either displaced or at risk of displacement -with a quota system where countries are taking a few hundred refugees."" He accused some EU countries of accepting a small number of refugees rather than providing humanitarian aid. ""I think we are fulfilling our moral obligations to the people of Syria,"" he said. ""The fact that the Finns, the French or the Swedes are going to take a few hundred people, that is not fulfilling your obligations."" Anna Musgrave, advocacy officer at the Refugee Council, welcomed Mr Cameron's move. ""For every person rescued from the region, a resettlement place would be life-changing,"" she said. Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, said: ""It's a huge relief that the Prime Minister is now prepared to revisit this issue and we must move swiftly to offer life-saving protection.""",Broadsheet,0,2014-01,0,Policy

The body of three-year-old Aylan changed the media narrative of this crisis and many more poignant images have been circulated. We have seen Laith Majid clutching his children as he sheds tears of joy after surviving Aylan's same journey, as well as children clambering through the windows to board packed trains in Macedonia, and a couple cradling their baby after desperately throwing themselves on train tracks as police try and take them to migrant camps in Hungary. Alongside these images of children and mothers, phrases such as ""among the dead were X many children and women"" are also used to stress the innocence and vulnerability of those who have died. I can understand why this might be a particularly compelling focus, but it raises the question: are Syrian men not innocent and vulnerable too? READ MORE:Surprised that Syrian refugees have smartphones? You're an idiot12 Syrian refugees a day for 5 years? That's hardly a response, Cameron David Cameron has now pledged to take in 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years, and singled out vulnerable children and orphans. This wasn't limited to one side of the political spectrum. Before his announcement, the former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett called on the Government to take 25,000 refugees over the next sixth months, and said that Syrian women and children should be given priority. So far this hasn't proved controversial - everyone seems to agree that young people and women require the most attention. But we must be careful not to forget that this is a humanitarian issue, and one that affects an entire population. Otherwise, the message we're sending is that the lives of Arab men do not matter. The refugee crisis - in pictures If our humanitarian sympathies are only summoned in response to children and families, then we risk dehumanising Arab men. This only helps to reinforce a history of Western misrepresentation, in which Arab men are viewed as dangerous, uncivilized, barbaric, and incapable of reason. This might not seem immediately obvious from their absence in the media's coverage. But the invisibility of the Arab men allows these ideas to insidiously fill the gaps, sometimes even subconsciously. When the media prioritises women and children over Arab men, it's easy for many people to conclude that this is for a reason, and that there is something inherently less valuable about them. And as it's hard for many Westerners to view the Middle East through anything but the lens of conflict, where Arab men are supposedly hell-bent on killing each other, their deaths seem inevitable, whether it's on the battleground or at sea. The children, as symbols of potential on the other hand, we can grieve for. We have been in this situation before. During World War Two, the British Government launched the Kindertransport programme, which rescued thousands of Jewish children from Nazi Germany during the late Thirties. The memory of this has been evoked as part of the Government's plan to take in Syrian refugees, and has helped further entrench the idea that it's only children whose lives are worth saving. Yet Syrian refugees are also fleeing as families, as well as individuals. Many of these adults are from middle-class or relatively affluent backgrounds with skills that would be of immense economic benefit to the countries they flee to. They're also just as human, and just as terrified of death, even if they're better at not showing it. In society's eyes, men might not symbolise vulnerability in the same way children and women do, but this should never lead us to give up on them.

Italy has already closed its borders to prevent migrants from travelling through Europe over land. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea stipulates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of circumstances, and that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking passengers off the ship.

The vote came as EU leaders were due to gather in Brussels today for an emergency summit to tackle the escalating migration crisis. Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic voted against the proposal to set binding relocation quotas of asylum seekers for each EU member state, as part of a plan to ease the strain on countries that are the first point of entry for most refugees, such as Greece or Italy. The relocation proposal, unveiled two weeks ago by the European Commission, allocates refugees to each member state based on how big they are, how rich they are, how many asylum seekers they already have, and their unemployment rate. The Czech government earlier indicated that compulsory quotas were illegal and that it could take the issue to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. At the same time, the Hungarian parliament yesterday passed a resolution calling on its government to ""defend itself by every necessary means"" against ""waves [of] illegal immigration"". The measure was strongly backed by Germany and France. Yet even among its supporters, there are growing concerns about whether a mandatory regime can be enforced. Some officials have admitted that refugees fleeing war and crossing seas and continents are unlikely to accept orders to stay in, say, Slovakia, when they really want to be in Germany. But German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière insisted that this would not happen. ""Refugees cannot decide to which country they want to go. If they want to move somewhere else, they will be sent back to the first EU country to which they were allocated,"" he said. Britain, which has an opt-out from such migration issues, has refused to take in any refugees from overstretched frontline EU states. Instead, it has said it will resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees from outside Europe over the next five years, with the government last night saying the first had arrived in the UK. Home Secretary Theresa May last night urged her counterparts to ""get on with the job of the wider measures that need to be taken of ensuring that we are breaking the link for economic migrants between making this dangerous journey and settling in Europe"". Mrs May said: ""We need to return those people who are illegally economic migrants and who have no right to be here and ensure that people arriving at Europe's borders are being properly dealt with, properly fingerprinted so that decisions can be made and when they are illegal economic migrants, they can be returned."" As well as endorsing the quota deal, EU leaders are today due to discuss longer-term strategies for dealing with the crisis, particularly increasing cooperation with Turkey and the other countries bordering war-torn Syria, where an estimated four million refugees are currently living. European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs EU summits, has said that the EU needs to help Syrian refugees find a better life closer to home. He has called for more aid to the World Food Programme and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He also wants to strengthen the EU's asylum agency, Frontex, into a full border and coastguard agency, and has said drawing up a list of ""safe countries"" whose citizens would not normally qualify for asylum, would also be up for discussion. 20,000 Syrians to be accepted by UK",Broadsheet,0,2015-09,1,Policy

It referred to a few hundred Syrian refugees who the United Nations was trying to resettle because they might not survive in the camps created by that country's civil war. These were some of the most desperate people alive today: wounded orphans, torture victims and recent widows.  But while many of our international allies, including the Europeans, Americans and Australians, signed up to the UN's humanitarian initiative, the British Government refused. It was wrong to do so, and this newspaper is leading the campaign to make it change its mind.  Last Saturday, we published an open letter from 25 of Britain's leading charities to the Prime Minister. In the House of Commons on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, reiterated his support for that letter, while a source close to Nick Clegg told our Political Editor, Andrew Grice, that the Liberal Democrat leader is campaigning hard for this inside government.  Yesterday, we published another open letter, this time from 55 peers. The shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper - who, incidentally, wrote editorials for The Independent in her career before politics - wrote a powerful article explaining why Labour is calling a vote in Parliament next week on the subject. Momentum, in other words, is building. Yet the Government remains indecisive, partly because David Cameron is under intense pressure from some of his Conservative comrades to avoid being seen as soft on immigrants. He and senior ministers have argued that Britain is already providing £600m of aid for Syria, and that you don't solve a refugee crisis by letting a few hundred of them into Britain. The first point is true and admirable. The second is ludicrous. Nobody, and least of all this newspaper, is suggesting that the horrors experienced by Syria's refugees will disappear if a few hundred of them are let into Britain. But each extremely vulnerable orphan, torture victim and desolate widow granted refuge in our country is a moral victory for us - and a potentially life-saving chance for them. It is also, by the way, good politics, because it aligns us with our allies and keeps Britain on the moral high ground in world affairs. As that Liberal Democrat source told us, it would be ""self-defeating to allow us to be painted as the least generous [country]"". Sometimes in politics you should put your hands up and admit you've got it wrong.

""No room at the inn,"" was The Independent's front page headline. After a series of articles by my colleague Jamie Merrill and I, and growing pressure from politicians and aid groups, David Cameron bowed to strong behind-the-scenes lobbying by Nick Clegg and climbed down. The Deputy Prime Minister announced that 500 of the most vulnerable refugees would be allowed into Britain. But Cameron refused to join 16 nations in the UN scheme. The U-turn took the issue out of the headlines. There was little controversy five months later when we revealed that only 24 Syrians had been given sanctuary. Ministers then explained that the 500 refugees would now be admitted over a three-year period. When the Syrian refugee crisis hit the front pages again this June, the new Conservative Government raised the 500 figure to up to 1,000. So far, only 216 have arrived from the camps in countries bordering Syria under the UK's go-it-alone resettlement scheme. This pattern of behaviour was repeated after the refugee crisis finally cut through to the public when the haunting photograph emerged of three-year-old Aylan al-Kurdi lying dead on a beach in Bodrum, Turkey. Cameron announced on 7 September that Britain would take up to 20,000 Syrians. A dramatic departure but again, our old friend ""up to"" is there. It could give the Government an escape hatch to accept fewer. Again, a headline-grabbing figure is not as immediate as it looks; this one will be achieved over the next five years. Officials insist the intention is to admit 400 Syrians a month from the refugee camps from next month. But given that only 216 have arrived in 20 months since the original U-turn, there is scepticism that such a rate will be maintained. Again, an act of ""compassionate Conservatism"" seems to have been dragged out of a reluctant Cameron by damaging headlines. Again, he was running to catch up with public opinion instead of leading it. Again, Britain will act in splendid isolation, working with the UN but eschewing the EU's scheme to accept a total of 160,000 refugees. I am told that Angela Merkel had private doubts about the European Commission proposals but knew instantly when the pictures of Aylan flashed around the world that Germany would have to sign up. A revealing difference between the British and German leaders. EU officials acknowledge Cameron's intellectual case that advertising a scheme welcoming refugees would encourage more of them to head for Europe. But morally and politically, the EU had to act. Although Hungary opposes compulsory quotas, other central and eastern European nations seem to be softening in order to show solidarity. They recognise what Merkel describes as ""the biggest challenge"" facing Europe she has known - bigger than the eurozone crisis which almost forced Greece out of the single currency. The refugee crisis - in pictures But Britain has dismayed its EU partners by shunning the refugees scheme, citing its opt-out on asylum policy. ""Technically right, politically wrong"" is the view that predominates in Brussels. Cameron can point proudly to the UK providing more than £1bn of humanitarian relief - mostly for the refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey - a much better record than other EU countries. Despite the scenes on our television bulletins, only 0.3 per cent of the 4 million Syrian refugees have reached Europe, Cameron aides say. He can deflect accusations of populism by reminding us that he has stuck to his pledge to keep overseas aid spending at 0.7 per cent of gross national income. It is true that, on migration, the Prime Minister must juggle very different demands from the public, Conservative MPs and the EU. He faces pressure from the same three directions as he renegotiates Britain's EU membership terms ahead of the In/Out referendum he intends to call next year. Although Cameron aides insist that migration and the new EU deal are ""two distinct issues"", that is not how things are seen in Brussels: in a 28-member club, everything is linked. Cameron's decision on refugees will harm his prospects of winning concessions in the renegotiation. ""There is a lot of finger-pointing going on,"" one government source admitted.  Cameron would like to hold his referendum next spring or by next autumn at the latest. But recent events could force a delay. First, the EU's existential crisis on migration means that other leaders may be reluctant to fiddle with the annoying ""British problem"" while the Treaty of Rome burns. Second, there is no mood to go the extra mile for a country that refuses to take part in the EU's refugees programme.

The man proposing the quota scheme is Jean-Claude Juncker, who said Cameron's lonely opposition to him becoming European Commission President last year was ""forgiven but not forgotten"". Juncker's allies say he is not minded to grant Cameron any special favours. When the Prime Minister attends the next EU summit on 15 October, he will be looking for progress on a new agreement for Britain. But his counterparts will have their minds firmly on the refugee and the migration crises. Cameron should temporarily waive Britain's opt-out on asylum and take part in the EU quota scheme - as Ireland has already done by agreeing to accept 4,000 Syrians. ""It would buy a lot of goodwill and transform the landscape for the British talks,"" said a diplomat from another EU nation. A good deal would make the referendum more winnable. It would be good politics and compassionate Conservatism, meeting Cameron's desire to react to the migration crisis with both ""head and heart"". But it almost certainly won't happen. Why?

But the continent's response is now ""taking shape"" with UN co-ordination and staff from international aid agencies and charities along the long route to western Europe. António Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said more still needed to be done to provide adequate reception facilities at points of transit, and to properly screen arrivals to separate those in need of protection.

In so doing he tried to break out of the narrow political discussion about how to help those on the run from despotism and societal failure in the Middle East and beyond. The pontiff spoke wisely about the moral duties of the individual towards those in need. Governments are, however, faced with a more complex challenge in dealing with the migrant exodus: how to strike a balance between democratic accountablity to their own needy citizens, how to keep an eye on the national interest and how at the same time to address the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. The Pope's chief task on Lesbos, a small Aegean island that has had to adapt to an influx of many tens of thousands of people washed up on its shores, was to make clear that Europe should not shun but embrace the refugees. The rhetoric of the far right that they represented some kind of Muslim assault on Christian Europe was itself un-Christian. The Good Samaritan did not help a fellow Samaritan but a Jew. Christian tolerance thus has to extend not just to Christians but to everyone, irrespective of race, religion or class. It was, said the Pope, up to ""all of our brothers and sisters on this continent"" to demonstrate fraternity, solidarity and respect for this mass mobilisation of peoples. Refugees had to be treated as individuals - not rendered faceless by the ""globalisation of indifference"" - and welcomed by individuals. To dramatise the message he took twelve Syrian Muslim refugees back home with him. The Vatican, of course, is not troubled by a huge influx of Muslims and as a theocratic mini-state does not have to concern itself as to whether multiculturalism works for all of its 450 citizens. Three Syrian families will not destroy the fabric of the Vatican City, any more than the 20,000 vulnerable Syrians accepted by Britain over the next four years will paralyse our country's schools and institutions. It was a gesture by a pontiff born of Italian immigrants (to Argentina) and directed not only at European Union states but also at the United States, indeed at all countries whose foundations were built by immigrants. The Good Samaritan parable informs individual behaviour by questioning how to confront misery that can be relieved. It is less useful when applied to governments who, according to the Pope, have ""the responsibility to welcome"", creating jobs and opportunities. The British government has chosen its own form of Samaritanism: it has become one of the world's top providers of aid to countries adjoining Syria. Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are bursting at the seams with refugees and by helping them in the camps we are actively stabilising the neighbourhood. Now this aid has to be more carefully targeted: on preventing a lost generation of Syrian children, by boosting literacy, by training camp inmates in the skills needed to rebuild their country. It is sad that the Pope did not address this question: the dilemma of the refugee eventually returning to a broken state.

If the donors regard this simply as a fundraising exercise, they will have failed. If they embrace radical plans to bring jobs, wages and education to camps where there is now only desperate need and inadequate aid, they will have turned a corner. The UN-sponsored Syrian donors' conferences have become a bleak annual reminder of the scale of the humanitarian disaster that President Assad has inflicted on his nation. They have always failed to meet their targets, with a combined shortfall of more than £4.5 billion since 2013. This year's conference may or may not reach its goal of £5.4 billion in new pledges. But it differs from its predecessors in one important respect: it is the first since 2015's great exodus to Europe. More than 550,000 Syrians entered Europe last year. Vastly more chose to remain in camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. These countries' combined Syrian refugee populations now number at least 4.5 million. If they are not offered compelling reasons to stay, the number heading for Europe this year and next will only rise. Such is the argument being made by aid agencies attending the conference. The logic is hard to fault, and it vindicates Britain's policy of targeting aid at refugees where they are most in need, rather than at those seeking asylum in the EU. The question is whether it is really possible to turn camps into special economic zones, and in the process ease the biggest refugee crisis since the Second World War. To judge from recent remarks by King Abdullah II of Jordan, there is no option but to try. ""Sooner or later the dam is going to burst,"" he said of the pressure on his country's borders and public services from an estimated 1.5 million refugees. The mood of Jordanians themselves, he said, has reached ""boiling point"". It would be foolish not to take King Abdullah at face value. Syrian refugees comprise a fifth of Jordan's population. In Lebanon the figure is a quarter. Turkey has absorbed a bigger influx but it represents only one in 30 of its population. The figure for the EU is one in 500. Barely one in 20 of the refugees in camps on Syria's borders at the start of last year opted to make the dangerous journey to Europe. Half of those now stranded in Jordan have told charity workers that they would attempt the trip if their conditions do not improve, but surveys suggest that with the prospect of work and schooling for their children, most would stay. Syria's neighbours and the agencies working with them will receive a cash injection from today's conference. Brussels has already pledged (EURO)2 billion, nearly twice as much as last year. In return host governments will be expected to be more generous with work permits. This is a step forward. At present, only 1 per cent of refugees in Jordan work legally, with the dismal result that half the Syrian refugee families there count a child as a main breadwinner because children are less likely to be punished if caught. Legalising work will not be enough. There must be work to do. Without substantial job-creation schemes, handing out work permits to refugees will only drive down wages in already depressed economies. Germany's economic development minister is to promote a project to create 500,000 short-term jobs in camps close to Syria. Most would be in construction of schools, clinics and water supply systems for the refugees themselves. British experts will advocate granting certain camps special access to EU markets, but the detail so far is thin. The task for this conference is to provide it. Without a comprehensive plan to improve life for Syria's refugees as close as possible to Syria, the crisis to come will dwarf the one Europe faces today.",Broadsheet,1,2016-02,1,Aid

They are part of a programme launched almost two years ago to bring in 20,000 Syrians driven from their homes by the civil war by 2020. Research for the report found that the scheme is working ""relatively well"" though some families in isolated areas or small towns had found it difficult and wished to move to cities for better employment and education prospects. Some refugees arrived with unrealistic expectations of health treatments and many were ""overwhelmed"" by the NHS which has complex rules on referring cases and waiting lists, the report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said. ""Understanding and using the system can be challenging. That is even more so for those with poor or nonexistent English, particularly where the treatment is for very serious illnesses such as cancer, kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis or for plastic surgery to treat extensive burns"", the report said. Parents were ""heartened"" that their children can catch up on lost education at school, but there could be improvefurther ments in English language provision and more help with finding work. Councils said that attendance rates at English for Speakers of Other Languages courses were relatively low among women with young children, those who were not literate in Arabic or English, and among a small number of 18 to 24-year-olds, mainly men, who were not in work, education or training. The UNHCR conducted the study with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and City, University of London to monitor how those who have already arrived in the UK have integrated. A total of 167 refugees from the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) were interviewed, more than half of whom were previously refugees in Lebanon, with the remainder travelling from Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UNHCR's representative in London, said: ""The UK clearly has the capacity to resettle meaningful numbers of refugees. Integration of refugees is complex. By and large it is working, and support for integration - from the public, local authorities and government - has been striking. We hope that, with development, this model can help more refugees from Syria and elsewhere resettle here after 2020.""",Broadsheet,1,2017-11,1,Migration

Officers discovered 1,263 lifejackets stuffed with non-buoyant material and branded ""Yamaxa"" in an apparent attempt to make them look like the genuine Yamaha brand. Two Syrian children were working in the factory in the resort of Izmir, on the Aegean coast. The raid came a day after the bodies of 34 refugees, seven of them children, washed up on the Turkish coast in the early hours of Tuesday. Their rubber boats had overturned soon after setting off. Many of the bodies were photographed still wearing their lifejackets, leading to speculation that they had been sold fake and ineffective models. Lifejackets can be found on sale in army surplus stores, convenience shops and even kebab restaurants in areas of Turkey where refugees congregate. They can be bought for as little as 50 Turkish lira (£11), but are useless as buoyancy aids. Most will absorb water and make it more difficult to stay afloat. ""I've seen washed-up lifejackets filled with stuff that looks like grass,"" Ann Davidson, a British expat who lives in the people-smuggling hub of Turgutreis, told The Times. ""They are selling them in the Sunday flea-market here."" Meanwhile, Wings of Lebanon, an airline that flies from Beirut to the Turkish coastal city of Adana, has started asking its customers not to steal the lifejackets. The airline launched in 2012 serving only the one route, initially for Syrian refugees, aid workers and diplomats travelling between the two major refugee-hosting countries. Over the past year, however, many of its passengers have been migrants and refugees travelling to Turkey to start illicit journeys to Europe. Huge piles of abandoned lifejackets litter the beaches of Greek islands such as Lesbos and Chios, which sit within striking distance of the Turkish coast and have become the landing points for over a million migrants in the past year. About 2,000 people are still attempting the sea journey each day. From today, Syrians will require visas to enter Turkey, for the first time in six years. The country's foreign minister said that the move aimed to tackle the number of migrants, many using fake Syrian passports, who enter in order to travel to Europe illegally.",Broadsheet,1,2016-01,0,Conditions
5186,src_thetimes_raw2.docx,The Times,12/7/2017,947 words,Roger Boyes,"Hungary was right about the migrant crisis; Europeans are adopting the idea that nation states, not the EU, must deal with immigration","There's a German word for it: Weltschmerz, the thud of anxiety that comes from living through, or alongside global upheaval. Brexit, Trump, serial terror attacks, the Grenfell Tower fire, we have all been touched by it, the galloping migraine-inducing pace of events. Imagine, then, what it feels like to live on the Italian island of Lampedusa, to have welcomed with aching hearts the thousands of refugees who washed up on its shores after the 2011 Arab uprisings, and to have shared the meagre infrastructure, so poor that pregnant locals have to take the long ferry ride to Sicily for a check-up. Then to be abandoned by the European Union and the Italian government, as the Mediterranean route became the chief entry path into the Continent for the desperate of sub-Saharan Africa. Now the Lampedusans have turfed out their mayor Giusi Nicolini who, decked with international prizes, had joined Angela Merkel as the champion of an open, liberal Europe. The locals want a mayor who will say to the world that the island can no longer cope; that Merkel's ""welcome culture"" no longer works for them. This is pretty much the story of the south and east of Europe. Their difficulty with strained infrastructure, once so acute that populist parties made political capital everywhere, was never really addressed. Central government's priority in 2015 was to provide a sticking plaster and it was left to local hosts to struggle on as best they could. Now the migrant numbers are rising fast again. Last year 181,436 migrants took the central Mediterranean route, up 18 per cent on the epic figures of 2015. This year is shaping up to be just as high. It has been two years since Merkel announced her Willkommenskultur and Europe is still groping around for a solution. Centrist parties, in the absence of a coherent multinational policy, are adopting the tough lines once advocated by the pariah parties of the far right. Germany recently tightened its deportation laws - rejected asylum-seekers can now be detained and electronically tagged long before their official deportation date to prevent them slipping the net. Personal data can be trawled from the mobile phones of refugees. Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian foreign minister, said earlier this month that his country should be ready to send troops to the Brenner Pass if it seemed that multitudes of migrants were about to come over from Italy. In Denmark, the centre-left Social Democrats have been making overtures to the anti-immigrant Danish People's Party. The Social Democrats even backed the (rarely used) jewellery law, whereby police were allowed to seize the jewellery of immigrants to pay for their stay. Suddenly, it seems as if the Hungarian model for dealing with immigration - widely condemned as a violation of civilised European values - was ahead of its time. Some 400,000 migrants travelled through the Balkans and across the Serbian border into Hungary in 2015. They were on their way westwards, drawn by Angela Merkel's offer of an open Germany, and very quickly Hungary felt overwhelmed. Tough police units were filmed beating back the foreigners and Hungary was cast as the ugly face of Europe. Viktor Orban, Hungary's garrulous prime minister, presents himself as the enemy of the EU liberal consensus (though happy to take its subsidies). Sure enough, there are grounds for concern, not least his hateful public campaign against the philanthropist George Soros. It does not bolster confidence when he declares that ""ethnic homogeneity"" is a key to economic success. Yet his reasoning behind the tainted rhetoric does strike a chord with many ordinary Hungarians. ""I do not want to see the country drifting towards a situation where lower-skilled work would only be carried out by foreigners,"" he says. ""We ourselves have to do the work required to keep our economy going, from scrubbing toilets to nuclear science."" Orban's point: if open immigration leads to an underclass of foreigners then it ends up sapping national dignity. His critics say that since he rejects the very idea of a benign multicultural society, he does not even want to make the effort of integrating foreigners or making the economy so porous that immigrants can prosper. It's not so much populism as indifference. The Hungarian prime minister is plainly no saint but he has been right in two important respects. First, Europe really is adrift on immigration. Second, it is ultimately up to nation states to find the correct balance between incomers and residents. Many in the EU are already quietly resigned to the idea that fortification of the external borders is the way to go. ""I would find myself with Sebastian Kurz stating our arguments to a roomful of ministers,"" Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian foreign minister, tells me, ""and I would find the colleagues discreetly texting me: 'Well said!' or 'If only I could have said that!'"" Political correctness is blocking the way to a collective recognition that the principles of asylum have to be rethought, that the bar on allowing refugees to work has to be lifted, that Schengen borders can no longer be as porous as they once were. Hungary doesn't have all the answers but it recognises the migrant crisis is a rolling one. We have to brace for the eventual collapse of the EU-Turkish deal which has kept so many Syrian refugees out of the EU over the past year. And if only a fraction of the climate change predictions are true, much of the world will be trekking towards Europe in a couple of decades. Let's start thinking more clearly about what that means for our frontiers and the way we are going to live our lives.

Most of the attacks occur on the Turkish mainland, where migrants await smugglers who will sneak them across the narrow strait separating the Greek island of Lesbos from Turkey. Witnesses, however, have also reported attacks at sea as armed robbers take to the water to plunder the savings and valuables with which Syrian refugees are seeking to start a new life in Europe. ""They know that the Syrians are loaded with money and jewellery,"" Daniel Esdras, of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said. ""They are easy targets. Authorities on both side of the Aegean have to act before this gets ever more violent."" Late on Wednesday IOM crews rescued the latest victims of such an assault from a raft washed up on Lesbos. Three women and one man, all Syrian, were taken to hospital with serious head and chest injuries sustained when they were set upon by armed robbers looking for cash and jewellry. The three women, also accompanied by five children, were each carrying (EURO)10,000, which the robbers seized in addition to their gold necklaces. Greek authorities fear the robberies are a new spin-off industry for people smugglers who no long join migrants on their sea journey for fear of being caught by law enforcement patrols.",Broadsheet,1,2015-08,1,Migration

The criticism by François Crépeau came as scores of migrants detained at a refugee camp on the island of Lesbos set rubbish bins ablaze, demanding that they be allowed free movement within the country. ""Detention should only be ordered when people present a risk, a danger, a threat to the public and it has to be a documented threat, it can't simply be a hunch,"" said Mr Crépeau, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants. Speaking at the end of a five-day visit, he urged the authorities in Greece to provide families with an alternative to detention. Many of the unaccompanied children he met were being held in police stations with no access to the outdoors. Others were being traumatised by distressing living conditions at overcrowded detention centres. ""This all creates an unacceptable level of confusion, frustration, violence and fear,"" he said. About one in four of the million-plus migrants who have come to Europe through Greece are children, according to the UN. ""Children should not be detained. Period,"" Mr Crépeau said. More than 6,600 migrants are being held in Greece as part of a EU deal in which asylum seekers who illegally enter the country are returned to Turkey, and Syrian refugees are then accepted into Europe from Turkish camps. European leaders argued that the agreement reached in March helps crack down on traffickers. However, human rights groups say it violates international law.

5070,src_thetimes_raw1.docx,The Times,30/8/2014,638 words,Catherine Philp,Half of all Syrians flee for their lives,"The number of Syrians forced from their country by the civil war has surpassed three million, the United Nations refugee agency said yesterday. The crisis, it added, was ""the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era"". At least one million Syrians have fled in the past year alone, the UNHCR said - and the actual figure was likely to be far higher, as the official tally included only those who had registered as refugees in neighbouring countries. Inside Syria itself, the picture is grimmer still, with 6.5 million people displaced from their homes by the fighting, often a number of times, as they seek safety within the limited reach of aid agencies. ""Almost half of all Syrians have now been forced to abandon their homes and flee for their lives,"" the agency said in a statement. António Guterres, the UN's high commissioner for refugees, said the crisis was a global challenge to which few nations had responded adequately. ""The world is failing to meet the needs of refugees and the countries hosting them,"" he said. The increasingly fragmented conflict has claimed more than 191,000 lives since it began in March 2011. Syria's neighbours have borne the brunt of an exodus that is not only crippling them financially but also threatening their own stability. Lebanon, with a population of less than five million, has taken in more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees. Jordan has registered 608,000 and Turkey 815,000. Tens of thousands more fled to Iraq over the past three years, only to meet the onslaught of Islamic State (Isis) militants as the group seeks to expand its self-declared caliphate through that country. David Miliband, the former foreign secretary who is president of the International Rescue Committee, said the figures represented ""three million indictments of government brutality, opposition violence and international failure"". He added: ""This appalling milestone needs to generate action as well as anger."" The UN said that the recent surge in fighting had dramatically worsened an already desperate situation, as Isis expanded its control through Syria and Iraq, terrorising rivals and civilians in both countries. Many of the refugees arriving in Jordan come from the northern province of Aleppo, where a three-way fight is under way between the Assad regime, mainstream Syrian rebels and Isis. Others fleeing to safety are from Raqqa, the jihadists' main stronghold in the northeast. A report from an independent UN commission investigating potential war crimes in Syria documented the dramatically deteriorating human rights situation in those areas in particular, placing blame on both regime and opposition forces. Public massacres, beheadings and crucifixions had become a common spectacle in areas under Isis control, the report said, alongside the mass killings of minorities, opponents and rivals. The commission also accused the Syrian government of the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians by barrelbombing urban areas and dropping shells filled with chlorine gas. Many of those arriving in neighbouring countries have already fled multiple times, from place to place within Syria, before finally crossing the border. They are arriving in an increasingly desperate condition, with their savings exhausted and their mental and physical health depleted - placing ever greater strains on the already stretched resources of the host nations. Lebanon suffered a second large incursion by Syrian-based Isis militants this week, prompting the US to send a $20 million (£12 million) cache of arms, including anti-tank missiles and mortar bombs, to bolster the national army. Earlier this month militants seized the town of Arsal on the Syrian border. The threat of the expansion of the Islamic State caliphate from Syria and Iraq has created a common front among Lebanon's normally fractious political forces.",Broadsheet,1,2014-08,0,Migration
